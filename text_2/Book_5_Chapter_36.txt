Hanuman, a strong monkey and Rama's friend, wanted to make Sita feel better. He showed her a ring from Rama.  "This ring is from Rama," Hanuman said.  "He sent it so you'll know he'll save you!"

Sita was so happy to see the ring!  It felt like Rama was right there. She smiled, her eyes shining like the moon.  She thanked Hanuman.

"You're so brave!" Sita said. "You swam across a huge ocean!  You're not just any monkey, you're a hero! Rama must be very brave and strong to choose you as his messenger."

But then Sita worried.  "Is Rama okay?" she wondered aloud. "Is he sad? Is he trying to rescue me?  Does he still love me even though I'm far away?"  She thought about Rama's family and friends. She wondered if they were all worried too.

Hanuman reassured her. "Rama is very sad without you," he said. "He's searching for you. He eats only fruits and roots. He doesn't even sleep well! He keeps calling your name!"  Hanuman described how Rama was heartbroken and missed Sita very much.  He told her about how Rama was constantly thinking about Sita. He even described what Rama was eating and how he was suffering.

Sita was happy to hear about Rama, but also sad that he was suffering.  Her happiness and sadness mixed together, like the moon hiding behind a cloud.
