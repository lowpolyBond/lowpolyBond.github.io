Bharata, Rama's younger brother, marched to war with a huge army!  He was joined by Yudhajita. Together, they went to fight the Gandharvas.

The Gandharvas were ready for a fight.  They shouted and got ready to battle.  The battle was HUGE and lasted for seven days!  Nobody won at first.  So much blood flowed, it looked like rivers!

Bharata got really angry. He shot a super powerful magic arrow!  Whoosh!  In a flash, three hundred thousand Gandharvas were gone!  It was the worst battle anyone had ever seen!

After the battle, Bharata took over the Gandharva cities. They were beautiful, full of treasure and sparkling jewels!  He even put people in charge of the cities.

Bharata ruled those beautiful cities for five years. They were amazing places with lots of parks, shops, and pretty palaces. Then, Bharata went home to Ayodhya.

He went to see his brother, Rama.  Bharata told Rama all about the battle and how he won. Rama was very happy to hear the good news!
