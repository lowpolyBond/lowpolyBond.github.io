A HUGE battle started!  Dhumraksha, a strong demon, charged into the fight.  The monkey army yelled and fought back!  They threw trees and rocks, and the demons threw spears and clubs.

Monkeys and demons hit each other hard.  Many monkeys got hurt, but they kept fighting!  They used big trees and rocks as weapons.  The demons used sharp arrows and big, heavy clubs.

The battle was wild!  Monkeys smashed demons with rocks and trees.  Demons fell down, bleeding.  The ground was covered with broken weapons and dead bodies. Even elephants and horses were hurt!  The monkeys scratched and bit the demons with their sharp nails and teeth.  The demons hit back with powerful punches, like thunder!  But the monkeys were strong and kept fighting.

Dhumraksha, the demon leader, was angry.  He fought bravely, hurting many monkeys.  But then, Hanuman, a super-strong monkey, saw his friends being hurt.  Hanuman was furious!

He picked up a HUGE rock and threw it at Dhumraksha's chariot.  The chariot crashed! Dhumraksha jumped out, but Hanuman kept fighting.  Hanuman smashed demons with tree trunks. He was so strong!

Hanuman then ripped off a mountaintop and smashed it onto Dhumraksha.  Dhumraksha fell to the ground, defeated!  The other demons ran away, scared.

Hanuman, tired but happy, was cheered by all the monkey leaders. He had won a great victory!
