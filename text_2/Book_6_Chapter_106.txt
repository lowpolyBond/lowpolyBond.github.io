Ravana, the ten-headed king, was furious!  His eyes were red with anger. He yelled at his charioteer, "You let Rama escape! You're a coward!  You disobeyed me!"

Ravana was very angry. He thought his charioteer was weak and maybe even a traitor. He shouted, "Because of you, I lost! Return to the battlefield at once!"

The charioteer was calm. He said, "Great King, I am not a coward!  I saw you were very tired after the big fight. Your horses were exhausted, too, like tired cows after a rainstorm.  The signs weren't good for us. A good charioteer knows when to rest and when to fight. I did what I thought was best to help you."

He explained that he knew when to fight and when to rest.  He watched Ravana carefully. He saw Ravana was tired.  The horses were tired, too.  He knew they needed a break.  That's why he took the chariot away.

Ravana listened.  He understood.  He was happy his charioteer was loyal. Ravana gave his charioteer a beautiful ring. "Drive me back to Rama!" he roared.

The charioteer whipped the horses.  Faster and faster they went!  In a flash, Ravana's chariot was back in the battle, ready to fight Rama again!
