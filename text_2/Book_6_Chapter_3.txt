Rama was very sad because his wife, Sita, was taken away by the ten-headed demon king, Ravana.  He asked his friend Hanuman, a very strong monkey, to find Sita. Hanuman flew all the way to Lanka, Ravana's magical island city, and saw amazing things!

He returned and told Rama all about Lanka. "It's a huge city, Rama!" Hanuman said. "It has giant walls made of gold and shining jewels!  Deep, deep moats full of crocodiles surround it.  The gates are massive, with huge iron bars and strong doors.  There are catapults and cannons to shoot enemies!"

Hanuman explained that Lanka had four big gates.  The east gate had ten thousand guards, the south gate had a hundred thousand, the west gate had ten thousand more, and the north gate had a whole million!  Inside the city, there were many more soldiers and elephants.

"It's protected by water, Rama," Hanuman added. "It's on a high mountain, hard to reach.  It's like a magical castle!"

But Hanuman wasn't scared.  "I even broke down parts of the walls and set some things on fire!" he boasted.  "If we can just get across the ocean, we can win!"

Hanuman suggested that some of the strongest monkeys, like Angada and Jambavan, could lead the attack on Lanka.  "We can bring Sita back!" he promised Rama.  "Let's go get her!"
