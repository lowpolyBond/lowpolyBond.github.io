King Dasaratha loved his sons, Rama and Lakshmana.  His wise advisor, Vasishtha, told him to send the princes on a special journey.  Before they left, the king said a prayer for their safety.  He hugged his sons and sent them off with Vasishtha.

As Rama and Lakshmana left, the wind blew softly, flowers rained from the sky, and people cheered.  Vishvamitra, a powerful and holy man, led the way. Rama and Lakshmana, strong and handsome, walked behind him, carrying their bows and arrows. They looked like brave warriors!

They walked to the Sarayu River.  Vishvamitra told Rama, "My dear boy, wash yourself in the river.  Then I'll teach you special secrets, Bala and Atibala.  These will keep you strong and healthy, protect you from harm, and make you very wise."

Rama washed and said, "I'm ready to learn, wise sir!"

Vishvamitra taught Rama the secrets.  Rama became even stronger and wiser.  That night, Rama and Lakshmana slept by the river.  Because they werenâ€™t used to sleeping on the ground, they made a bed of grass.  They listened to Vishvamitra's stories before falling asleep.
