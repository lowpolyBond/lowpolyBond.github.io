Hanuman, a monkey with skin the color of coral, quietly climbed down from a tree. He saw a sad lady sitting under it.  Her eyes were as pretty as lotus flowers, and she was wearing a dirty silk dress.  Tears were falling down her face.

Hanuman asked her kindly, "Who are you, beautiful lady? Are you a princess, a goddess, or someone else? Why are you so sad?"

The lady, Sita, was very happy to hear someone speak.  She said, "I'm Sita. I'm the wife of Rama, a very good king.  We lived happily, but then..."

Sita explained that Rama was supposed to be king, but his stepmother tricked her husband's father into sending Rama away to the forest. Sita went with him.  Then, a ten-headed demon named Ravana kidnapped her!  He said he would kill her in two months.

Sita was very sad, but hearing Ramaâ€™s name made her feel a little better.  Hanuman knew he had to help her and rescue her husband.
