Rama and his brother Lakshmana were very brave princes.  They went to help a wise man named Vishvamitra. Vishvamitra was doing a very important magic ceremony, a sacrifice. But evil demons wanted to stop him!

Rama and Lakshmana asked Vishvamitra, "When will the demons come? We want to protect your ceremony!"

Vishvamitra said, "Watch for six days. I'll be quiet and do the ceremony."

So, Rama and Lakshmana guarded the ceremony for six days. They didn't sleep!  They had their bows and arrows ready.

On the sixth day, Rama told Lakshmana, "Get ready! They're coming!"  Suddenly, the fire in the ceremony blazed up!  Then, scary sounds filled the air.  Lots of demons appeared, like dark clouds in a storm.  They were throwing blood everywhere!

Rama and Lakshmana were angry.  They saw two demons, Marica and Suvahu.  Rama said, "Lakshmana, look!  I'll stop them!"

Rama threw a powerful magical weapon at Marica.  It hit Marica and sent him flying far away into the sea!  Then, Rama used another magical weapon to defeat Suvahu.  He used a third weapon to defeat the rest of the demons.

All the demons were gone!  Vishvamitra was so happy. His ceremony was safe. He said, "Rama, you are a true hero! You protected my ceremony!" Rama and Lakshmana were very proud. They had saved the day!
