Hanuman, the super-strong monkey, swam across the huge ocean!  He climbed a mountain and looked down at Lanka, a sparkly island.  Flowers rained down on him, but he wasn't tired at all!  He said, "I swam so far! This ocean is nothing!"

He leaped across the land, smelling sweet honey from the flowers and trees.  He saw Lanka, a beautiful city on a mountaintop!  There were colorful flowers everywhere, pretty birds singing, and swans swimming in ponds with blue and white lilies.  The city was so amazing, it looked like a city of the gods!

Lanka was a giant city, surrounded by a big wall and guarded by scary demons.  It had tall, golden buildings that looked like clouds!  The streets were shiny and white, with flags flying everywhere.  Hanuman thought it was the most wonderful place he’d ever seen.  It looked like a beautiful woman, he thought, made by a magical builder!

Hanuman went to the city gate.  He worried, "Even if Rama's army comes, how can they beat Ravana's army?  They're too strong!  Only a few monkeys – me, Nila, Sugriva, and one other – could even get here.  But first, I have to find Sita!"

He thought about finding Sita, Rama's wife.  "I can't go into the city in my big monkey form!  The demons will see me! I need to sneak in!"  He decided to get smaller, like a little cat.

When the sun went down, Hanuman became tiny!  He snuck into Lanka. The city was so amazing at night! It had glittering buildings and golden pillars. He felt happy and sad at the same time; happy to be in such a beautiful place, but sad because Sita was trapped there. The moon shone brightly, helping him see.  He was ready to find Sita!
