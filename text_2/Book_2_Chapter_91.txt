Prince Bharata visited a wise holy man.  He'd already eaten some fruit and berries, so he said, "Thank you, I'm full!"

But the holy man smiled.  "I want to feed your whole army!" he said. "Why did you come alone? Where is your army?"

Bharata explained, "I left them behind.  I didn't want their horses and elephants to hurt the trees and plants, or mess up the water."

"Bring them here!" said the holy man.

Bharata brought his army. The holy man did some magic!  Suddenly, amazing things appeared!  Vishvakarma, a magical builder, made beautiful houses for everyone.  Gods and goddesses came to help!  There was delicious food and drink everywhere – sweet drinks, yummy treats, and all kinds of meat!

The rivers even gave wine!  Beautiful dancers danced, and musicians played wonderful music.  The ground was covered in soft, green grass, and there were sparkling trees.  There were even special places for the elephants and horses!

Bharata and his soldiers had wonderful houses, with comfy beds and amazing food.  They had everything they could possibly want!  Twenty thousand beautiful women came to help them relax!

The soldiers ate and drank until they were happy and full. They were so happy, they said, "We don't want to go home! Let Bharata stay here!"

Everyone in the army had a wonderful time. They played, danced, and ate.  They were so happy they thought they were in heaven!

When morning came, the magic disappeared. The gods and goddesses went home. But Bharata’s army was still happy and sleepy from their amazing feast!  They had had the best party ever!
