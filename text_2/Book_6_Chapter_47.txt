Ravana's son came back to Lanka.  He had done what his father wanted!  The monkey heroes surrounded Rama to protect him.  Hanuman, Angada, and many other strong monkeys stood guard. They were so alert, they'd shout "It's a giant!" if even a blade of grass moved!

Ravana was very happy. He sent his son away. Then he called the women who guarded Sita.  He told them, "Tell Sita that Rama and Lakshmana are dead!  Tell her to get into the flying Pushpaka chariot.  Show her Rama and Lakshmana lying on the battlefield.  Now she'll have no choice but to be with me!"

The women said, "Yes, we will!" They went to the Pushpaka chariot and flew to Sita.

Sita was very sad because she missed Rama. The women gently put her in the chariot.  Ravana showed Sita around Lanka in the flying chariot. He even told everyone that Rama and Lakshmana were dead!

From the chariot, Sita saw many dead monkeys. She saw sad monkeys around Rama and Lakshmana.  She saw Rama and Lakshmana lying on the ground.  They were hurt and covered in arrows. Their armor was broken, and their bows were snapped.

Sita was heartbroken! She saw her brave Rama and Lakshmana, looking like they were sleeping.  She cried and cried.  She thought they were dead.  She was so sad!  She said...
