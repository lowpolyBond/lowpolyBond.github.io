Rama was worried about his friend, Indrajit.  He sent ten strong monkey leaders to find him.  These monkeys were super strong and brave!

The monkeys zoomed into the sky, looking everywhere. But Indrajit, a powerful warrior, was sneaky! He shot many arrows from his amazing bow.  The arrows flew so fast, the monkeys couldn't see Indrajit and got hurt.  It was like the sun hiding behind a big cloud!

Then, Indrajit attacked Rama and Lakshmana!  He was invisible, like a magic trick!  He shot so many arrows, Rama and Lakshmana were covered in them.  They were hurt badly, and blood flowed.

Indrajit laughed.  He said, "Even the strongest god couldn't see me!  You're trapped!" He shot more arrows.

Rama and Lakshmana were covered in arrows.  They fell to the ground, hurt and tired. They looked like they were covered in flowers!  Every part of their bodies was bleeding.  Indrajit kept shooting.  Rama's bow even broke!

Lakshmana was very sad to see Rama hurt. The monkeys were very sad too. They cried and felt hopeless.  They surrounded Rama and Lakshmana, waiting to see what would happen next.  They were scared but didn't leave their friends.
