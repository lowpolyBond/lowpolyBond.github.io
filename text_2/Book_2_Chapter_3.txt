King Dasaratha was very happy!  His people wanted his son, Rama, to become the next ruler.

"Today is a wonderful day!" the king announced. "Rama will be our next prince!"

He asked wise men, like Vasishtha and Vamadeva, to get ready for a big ceremony.  It would happen in the spring, when the trees were blooming.

Everyone cheered!  Then the king told Vasishtha, "Please plan the celebration!"

Vasishtha told the helpers to get everything ready: gold, jewels, pretty flowers, yummy food, chariots, weapons, elephants, and flags.  Lots and lots of things!

They needed to decorate the palace with flowers and make it smell nice.  They needed to prepare a huge feast for many, many priests, giving them enough food and gifts to last a long, long time.  They needed singing girls and musicians!  They had to make sure everything was perfect.

Vasishtha and Vamadeva made sure everything was ready. Then the king called for his son, Rama.  Sumantra, the king's helper, brought Rama in a fancy chariot.  Kings from everywhere came to see Rama.

King Dasaratha was so proud of his son! Rama was strong, brave, and kind. He was handsome, like the moon!  He made everyone happy.

The king hugged Rama and asked him to sit on the special golden throne. Rama looked like the sun!

King Dasaratha gave Rama some advice. "Be kind to everyone," he said.  "Always be fair, and try to understand what everyone needs."

Rama said, "I will, Father."

Then Rama went back home. Everyone was happy because Rama would be the next prince! They prayed that everything would go well.
