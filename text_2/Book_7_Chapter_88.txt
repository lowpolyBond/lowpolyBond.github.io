King Rama told a wonderful story!  Lakshmana and Bharata were amazed.  They begged Rama to tell them more about a king who changed into a woman and then back again.

"What happened to him?" they asked.

Rama told them what happened.  The king, changed into a woman, spent a month with his friends. They went for a walk in the forest.  They didn't ride in carriages; they walked!  They played near a pretty lake full of birds.

At the lake, they saw Budha, the son of the Moon.  He was very handsome and holy. He was doing special prayers in the water.

Ila, the king-turned-woman, was so beautiful!  Budha saw her and fell in love. He thought, "She is the most beautiful woman I've ever seen! I want to marry her!"

He waited a moment, then came out of the water.  He asked the women about Ila.  They told him that Ila was their queen, and she didn't have a husband.

Budha was a very wise man.  He knew all about the king's magic change.  He told the women, "You will all live here on this mountain.  You'll eat fruits and plants. And you'll be together, happy and safe."

And just like that, all the women changed into a special kind of people called Kimpurushis and lived happily on the mountain!
