King Ravana was furious!  Two of his messengers, Shuka and Sarana, had just told him all about Rama's amazing monkey army.  They described strong monkeys like Hanuman, Angada, and Sugriva.  Ravana shouted at them.  "You're bad messengers! You praise our enemies!  You should be afraid of me!"

Ravana was very angry. He yelled and scolded Shuka and Sarana. He said they were ungrateful and didn't deserve to live.  But he let them go anyway.

Then, Ravana called for more spies.  He wanted to know Rama's secret plans. He wanted to know who Rama's friends were, when he slept, and what he was going to do next.  Ravana believed a good king always knows his enemy's secrets.

Ravana sent his new spies to find out everything about Rama.  They snuck off to watch Rama, Lakshmana, Sugriva, and Vibhishana near a mountain.

But the spies were scared when they saw the monkey army!  Vibhishana, who was actually a good monkey and Rama's friend, caught them!  He only kept one spy, Shardula, as a prisoner.  But Rama was kind and let all the spies go free.

The spies ran back to Ravana, tails between their legs.  They were all bruised and scared from the monkeys.  They told Ravana that Rama's army was near the Suvela Mountain, and that the monkeys were very strong and quick.
