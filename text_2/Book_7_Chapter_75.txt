Rama heard some good news from his friend Narada.  He was very happy! He told his brother Lakshmana, "Lakshmana, please help that sad Brahmin.  Put the child's body in a jar with nice oil and special scents.  Make sure it stays safe."

Lakshmana promised to help.  Rama then called for his magical flying chariot, Pushpaka.  "Pushpaka, come!" he said.  Whoosh! The golden chariot appeared.  "I'm here, Prince Rama!" it said.

Rama bowed to the wise holy men and got into Pushpaka. He had his bow, arrows, and sword.  He left his brothers Bharata and Lakshmana in charge of the city.

Rama flew all around.  He went west, then north, looking for any trouble.  The people in the east were very good.  He flew south, too.  Near a big mountain, he saw a lake.  By the lake, a holy man was doing a very hard penance.  His head was hanging down!

Rama went to talk to him.  "Hello," Rama said. "You are very holy!  I'm Rama, son of Dasaratha.  What are you doing? What do you want? Are you a Brahmin, a Kshatriya, a Vaishya, or a Shudra?"  (Those are different groups of people.)

The holy man told Rama his story and why he was doing this very hard penance.
