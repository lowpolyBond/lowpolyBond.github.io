Poor Sampati, the vulture, was so sad he could barely speak.  The monkey chiefs didn't trust him at first.  They thought he might trick them.

The monkeys were sitting, ready to starve themselves.  They saw Sampati and made a plan.  "Let's help him down," they said. "If he eats us while we're fasting, we'll still succeed!"

So they helped Sampati down.  Then Angada, a strong monkey, told Sampati their story:

"My grandfather was Riksharajas, the very first monkey king. He had two sons, Bali and Sugriva, who were super strong. My dad, Bali, was the most famous warrior.

Rama, a great king, went into the Dandaka forest with his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana.  A bad king named Ravana stole Sita!  Jatayu, a brave vulture and Rama's friend, tried to stop Ravana. Jatayu fought bravely, but Ravana killed him. Rama gave Jatayu a proper burial.

Then Rama helped my uncle Sugriva.  Rama defeated my father Bali, and Sugriva became king. Now, Sugriva sent us to find Sita. We've searched everywhere, but we couldn't find her. We got lost in a magical cave and missed our deadline!  If we go back, Sugriva and Rama will be very angry and punish us.  So we're starving ourselves to die."
