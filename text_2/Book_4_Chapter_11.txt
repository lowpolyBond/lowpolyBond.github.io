Once upon a time, a brave monkey named Sugriva met Rama, a powerful prince. Sugriva was worried about his super-strong brother, Bali.  Bali was so strong, he could move mountains!

Sugriva told Rama a story.  He told about a giant buffalo named Dundubhi. Dundubhi challenged the ocean to a fight! The ocean said, "I can't fight you, but there's a mountain king named Himavat who can."

Dundubhi went to fight Himavat.  Himavat was peaceful and didn't want to fight. Dundubhi asked Himavat who *could* fight him. Himavat said, "Go find Bali! He's the strongest!"

So Dundubhi went to find Bali. He roared and smashed trees! Bali came out and fought the giant buffalo.  Bali was super strong! He beat Dundubhi easily and threw his body far away!

The giant's blood landed on a wise man's home. The wise man was angry! He put a curse on Bali: if Bali ever came near his home, he would die!

Because of this curse, Bali was afraid to go to certain places. Sugriva, now scared of his brother, asked Rama for help.  

Sugriva said, "Rama, Bali is too strong!  To show you can beat him, shoot one arrow through seven giant trees that Bali broke.  Then kick that dead buffalo really far!"

Rama smiled. He easily kicked the dry buffalo body far, far away. Sugriva said, "Well, that was easy because the buffalo is all dried up. Can you shoot through the trees now?"  Rama agreed to try. He was going to show Sugriva just how powerful he really was.
