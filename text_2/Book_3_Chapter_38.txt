Once upon a time, there was a powerful demon named Marica. He was HUGE and strong, like a giant mountain!  He was dark like a storm cloud and wore sparkly gold bracelets. He was very scary, and everyone was afraid of him.

Marica lived in a forest called Dandaka. He ate people! A wise, brave man named Vishvamitra was worried. He went to King Dasaratha and said, "King, Marica is very dangerous!  Please, let your son Rama protect me!"

King Dasaratha said, "Rama is still young! I will send my army." But Vishvamitra said, "Only Rama can defeat Marica. He is a brave warrior, even though he is young."

So, Vishvamitra took young Rama to the forest. Rama was small, but he was very good with a bow and arrow. He looked like the new moon shining in the dark forest.

Marica, feeling powerful, went to Vishvamitra's camp.  He thought Rama was just a little boy, but Rama was quick! He shot an arrow!  Whoosh! It flew far, far away, and knocked Marica into the sea! Rama didn't want to hurt him too much, but Marica was knocked out.

After a long time, Marica woke up and swam back to his home, Lanka.  But many of his friends who tried to help were defeated by Rama.

Marica warned the king of Lanka, "Don't fight Rama! He is incredibly strong. If you try to take Sita (Rama's wife), Rama will defeat you and destroy Lanka.  It will be a terrible disaster.  Don't do it!"

Marica said,  "It's wrong to take someone else's wife. You have many wives, so be happy with them. Don't fight Rama or you'll be very sorry!"

So Marica warned the king to stay away from Rama and Sita,  or face the consequences. The king of Lanka should learn a lesson about being kind and respectful!
