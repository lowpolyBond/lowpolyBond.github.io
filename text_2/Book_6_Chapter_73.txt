Once upon a time, after a big battle, some giants ran to tell King Ravana some sad news.  His sons and brothers were dead!  Ravana was very, very sad. He cried a lot.

Then his son, Indrajit, a super strong warrior, came to him. "Father," he said, "don't be sad! I'm still here! I'll defeat Rama and Lakshmana today!  I'll show them my power!"

Indrajit jumped into his super-fast chariot, pulled by amazing horses.  Lots of other giants followed him, riding elephants, tigers, even giant scorpions and cats! They had swords, spears, and big hammers.  They made lots of noise with drums and horns.  Indrajit looked like the sun, shining brightly!

Before the battle, Indrajit did a special ceremony with fire. He prayed to the fire god for help. Then, POOF! He disappeared!

The giants attacked Rama's monkey army.  They threw sharp spears and arrows. Indrajit, hidden, shot arrows from the sky.  Many monkeys fell.  Even strong monkey leaders like Jambavan and Angada were hurt.

Indrajit was so strong, he could hit many monkeys with one arrow!  The monkeys were scared, but they kept fighting.  They threw rocks and trees at Indrajit.

Finally, Indrajit even attacked Rama and Lakshmana! He shot so many arrows at them, that they almost fell down. But Rama and Lakshmana stayed brave. They knew Indrajit was powerful, but they would keep fighting.

Indrajit won the battle that day. He went back to Ravana, very proud of his victory.  Ravana was happy that his son was so strong. But the war wasn't over yet!
