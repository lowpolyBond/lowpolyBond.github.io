Rama was a very strong and good prince.  A mean giant named Khara was bullying everyone in the forest. Khara boasted, "I'll make everyone cry!"

Rama shot his arrows and smashed Khara's big club into pieces!  "Is that all you've got?" Rama laughed. "You talk big, but you're not so strong!"  Rama said he would defeat Khara, just like a bird named Garuda once took magic juice.

Khara was furious! He yelled insults at Rama.  Then he ripped up a huge tree and threw it like a weapon!  "Now you're dead!" he roared.

But Rama easily chopped the tree to pieces!  He was so angry, he fired many arrows at Khara.  Khara bled badly.  He ran at Rama, but Rama shot one special arrow –  it was like a super-powerful lightning bolt!  The arrow hit Khara, and he fell down dead.

The gods in the sky cheered! They said Rama was incredibly brave.  He had defeated Khara and 14,000 other bad giants!

Wise men came to thank Rama.  They said, “We asked for a hero to help us, and you are that hero! Now we can live in peace.”

Rama's brother Lakshmana and his wife Sita came out of hiding. They were so happy to see Rama safe! Sita hugged Rama tightly.  Everyone celebrated Rama's victory!  The forest was safe again.
