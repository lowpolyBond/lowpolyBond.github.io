In the battlefield, fierce and hot, they clashed,
Two armies fought, their strength and valor matched.
Like lakes that shrink in summer's burning sun,
Both armies fell, their numbers overrun.

Ravana, demon lord, with fury burned,
His forces dwindled, lessons unlearned.
Restless, he sought to change his waning fate,
Turn back the tide, unleash his demons' hate.

To Mahodara, Ravana turned his gaze,
His trusted warrior, in battle's blaze.
"Your strength, Mahodara, now we require,
To quench the monkey's fury, quell their fire.

"Go forth, brave demon, crush the enemy's might,
Fight well this day and prove your loyal might.
Repay the debt you owe, your master's call,
Destroy the foe, let victory be our all."

Mahodara, emboldened by his king,
Dove headfirst into battle's fiery ring.
With arrows gold-adorned, he struck his foes,
The monkeys fell, as trees in tempest's throes.

The monkeys, strong, fought back with all their might,
Hurling rocks and trees, they joined the fight.
But Mahodara's arrows pierced the air,
Like fiery meteors, a deadly glare.

Some monkeys fled, their courage worn and thin,
Seeking refuge with Sugriva, their king.
Seeing his army falter, Sughreeva roared,
He charged ahead, his strength and courage soared.

With mighty rock, like mountain's solid form,
He hurled it at the demon, fierce and warm.
But Mahodara, skillful and composed,
With arrows, shattered rock, it lay exposed.

Sugriva, undeterred, picked up a tree,
A mighty weapon, strong as it could be.
He hurled it at the demon with great force,
Their battle raged, no sign of a truce.

Mahodara, his horses slain in fight,
Took up a mace, his foe to smite.
They faced each other, like two bulls at war,
Two thunderclouds, their fury could not ignore.

With mace and iron rod, they clashed and roared,
Like tempests wild, in battle's fierce accord.
Their mighty blows, like lightning in the sky,
Struck hard, as mountains clash, and heroes vie.

Mahodara's mace, like sun, did blaze,
Sugriva's iron rod, a fiery maze.
They shattered weapons, clashed with fists and might,
Rolled on the ground, a fierce and endless fight.

On weary feet, they rose to strike again,
Their rage unyielding, fury uncontain.
With all their weapons shattered, strength near spent,
They faced each other, in the fray, hell-bent.

But soon, their strength gave way to weariness,
And wrestling ceased, their struggles less and less.
Mahodara, with sword and shield, did arm,
Sugriva, too, prepared to face the harm.

With swords upraised, they circled in a dance,
Two warriors, ready for their final chance.
They charged ahead, their minds on victory,
But destiny had plans, as we shall see.

Mahodara, swift and fierce, did strike,
His sword fell hard, Sugriva's shield alike.
But Sugriva, with strength and courage grand,
Severed Mahodara's head, in battle's sand.

As Mahodara fell, his end was nigh,
His demon army watched, their hopes run dry.
In shock and awe, the demons fled the field,
Sugriva's victory, their fate was sealed.

With Mahodara slain, Sugriva roared,
The monkeys cheered, their courage fully stored.
Ravana, in rage, his army in despair,
Saw Mahodara's fall, his heart laid bare.

The battle won, the gods above looked on,
Sugriva, victorious, his glory shone.
His name resounded, echoed far and wide,
A hero in the battle, on that fateful ride.
