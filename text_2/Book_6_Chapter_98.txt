A great battle raged!  The monkey army and the giant army fought hard.  It was like two big puddles drying up in the hot sun – so many soldiers were hurt and falling.  One giant, Virupaksha, was killed.  The giant king, Dashagriva, was very angry.

He called for his strongest giant, Mahodara.  "Mahodara," he roared, "you are our only hope!  Go fight! Show them your power!"

Mahodara said, "Yes!" and charged into the monkey army like a moth to a flame. He was strong and brave, and he hurt many monkeys.

The monkeys fought back! They threw big rocks at the giants.  Mahodara, very angry, cut the rocks to pieces with his arrows.  The monkeys fought hard, but some ran away to Sugriva, their king.

Sugriva saw his army was losing. He grabbed a HUGE rock, like a small mountain, and threw it at Mahodara!  But Mahodara sliced the rock with his arrows!

Sugriva then threw a whole tree! Mahodara broke that too!  Sugriva then found a big iron bar.  He swung it and smashed Mahodara's chariot horses!

Mahodara jumped down, grabbed a big club, and fought Sugriva! They swung their weapons, roaring like angry bulls! Sugriva’s bar broke, but he picked up a giant club.  Both clubs smashed!

Now they fought with their fists!  They punched and wrestled, falling to the ground.  They grabbed swords and fought again. Mahodara stabbed at Sugriva, but his sword broke!  Sugriva swung his sword and cut off Mahodara's head!

The giant army ran away! The monkeys cheered.  Dashagriva was furious, but Rama was happy.  Everyone was amazed at Sugriva’s victory!  Even the gods in the sky watched and were happy for the monkey king.
