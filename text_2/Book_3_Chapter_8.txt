Rama and Sita spent a wonderful night at the hermit's home.  In the morning, they all woke up early.  Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana bathed in a cool, pretty river filled with lotus flowers.

After praying to the gods, they politely went to thank the wise hermit, Sutikshna.  Rama said, "Thank you for being so kind to us.  We need to go now and visit other holy people in the Dandaka Forest. We want to see them before it gets too hot!"

Sutikshna, a very kind hermit, hugged Rama and Lakshmana. He told them, "Go safely! The Dandaka Forest is beautiful. Youâ€™ll see lots of lovely things: juicy fruits, pretty flowers, happy deer, colorful birds, and sparkling lakes!  Come back and visit again soon!"

Sita gave Rama and Lakshmana their bows and arrows and swords.  Then, Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita said goodbye to the hermit and started their journey. They were ready for their exciting adventure!
