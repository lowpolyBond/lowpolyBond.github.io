Rama and his brother Lakshmana went with a wise man named Vishvamitra to King Janaka's big party.  It was a special celebration!  Lots and lots of people were there.  Many priests and carts full of things for the celebration.  "Let's find a good place to rest," said Rama and Lakshmana to Vishvamitra.

They found a nice quiet spot near some water.

King Janaka heard Vishvamitra had arrived. He rushed over and bowed politely.  He gave Vishvamitra a sweet drink.  He asked if everything was going well with the party.  He greeted all the other important people, too.

The king then said, "Welcome, wise Vishvamitra! Please sit with the other wise men."  Everyone sat down.

The king was very happy. He said, "Thanks to the gods, everything is ready! Your visit makes this party even better! The party will last twelve days. The gods will come then, and you can see them!"

Then the king looked at Rama and Lakshmana.  He was amazed! They were so strong and handsome! "Who are these amazing princes?" he asked Vishvamitra. "They look like gods!  Are they here to make our kingdom famous?"

Vishvamitra smiled. "They are the sons of King Dasaratha," he said.  He told the king all about Rama and Lakshmana's adventures: fighting bad guys, helping a lady named Ahalya, and meeting another wise man.  "And now," Vishvamitra said, "we are here to see the great bow!"  Then he stopped talking.
