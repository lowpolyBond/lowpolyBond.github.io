One morning, Hanuman the monkey was hiding in the forest. He heard singing and music.  It was almost sunrise.

Then, a big, ten-headed king named Ravana woke up.  He was the king of the demons! He thought about Sita, a beautiful princess he had kidnapped.  He was very much in love with her.

Ravana got dressed in his best clothes and jewels. He went to the Ashoka Grove, a beautiful garden with lots of trees, flowers, and birds.  Many beautiful women followed him. They carried lamps, fans, and even a special seat for him!

Ravanaâ€™s wives followed him. They were sleepy and a little tipsy from wine. Their jewelry jingled as they walked.

Hanuman heard the jingling of their bracelets and anklets. He saw Ravana, all shiny and bright from the lamps the women carried.  Ravana looked proud and happy, but also a bit drunk.

Hanuman saw Ravana walking towards Sita.  Ravana was so bright and strong, that Hanuman hid better among the leaves.  He knew this was the powerful Ravana who had stolen Sita.  Hanuman watched as Ravana went to see Sita.
