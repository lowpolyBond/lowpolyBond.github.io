The king woke up. He felt sad and worried. He called his driver, Sumantra. Sumantra was dusty and crying.  The king asked, "Sumantra, how are Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana?  Rama is sleeping on the ground! He used to have a comfy bed in the palace! How can he sleep in the forest with scary animals? How will Sita walk barefoot?  Tell me everything!"

Sumantra, all choked up, told the king what happened. Rama said goodbye with respect. He asked Sumantra to tell everyone he was okay. He told Sumantra to give special messages to his mom, Kaushalya.  He told her to be kind to everyone in the palace, especially to his stepmother, Kaikeyi, even though Kaikeyi made him leave.

Rama also sent a message to his brother, Bharata.  He told Bharata to be good to his father and to all the mothers. He told Bharata not to become king yet.

Lakshmana was very angry! He said, "This is so unfair!  The king listened to Kaikeyi's silly wish and sent Rama away! How could he do this to Rama, who is so good?"

Sita was very sad and quiet. She couldn't speak, just cried and looked at Sumantra.  She was heartbroken to see Rama so sad.

Sumantra told the king all this.  The king felt a little better, knowing what happened to his beloved son.
