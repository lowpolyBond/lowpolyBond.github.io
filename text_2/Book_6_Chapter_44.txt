It was a dark and scary night.  Monkeys and giants were still fighting!  They couldn't see each other very well in the dark.  "Are you a giant?" the monkeys shouted.  "Are you a monkey?" the giants yelled back! They swung and hit each other.  "Attack!" "Kill!" they cried.

The giants were big and strong, like dark hills covered in glowing plants. They charged at the monkeys, wanting to eat them! The monkeys jumped on the giants' horses and chariots, tearing them apart with their sharp claws. They even fought the giant elephants!

Rama and Lakshmana, brave warriors, fought hard too.  Their arrows flew like poisonous snakes, hitting many giants.  The battlefield was dusty and bloody.  The sounds of fighting were awful â€“ drums banging, horns blowing, horses neighing, and people screaming.  The ground was covered with dead monkeys and giants, and weapons.  It was a terrible, bloody mess!

The giants used the darkness to sneak up on Rama.  But Rama was super fast! He shot six arrows like fiery streaks, hitting six giants instantly!  He kept shooting, making the night bright with his arrows.  The giants ran away, scared.

A giant named Angada fought bravely too. He fought so well he defeated a very powerful giant called Indrajita. Indrajita was so angry, he disappeared! But then, using magic, he reappeared and shot lots of arrows at Rama and Lakshmana, trapping them! The monkeys watched in fear as Rama and Lakshmana were caught.  Indrajita was sneaky!  He couldn't beat them fairly, so he used magic.
