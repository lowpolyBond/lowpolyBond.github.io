In fiery battle's rage, their fates entwined,
Ravana and Rama, to the fray inclined.
As Mahodara, Virupaksha did fall,
Ravana's wrath ignited, heeding the call.

He spurred his charioteer, these words he said,
"With Rama and Lakshmana, blood shall be shed.
For ministers and city, lost in strife,
I'll end this pain, reclaim my former life.

"Rama's like a tree, with Sita as its fruit,
Monkeys are the branches, strong and astute.
To fell this tree, my mission I'll fulfill,
With my arrows sharp, their destiny I will."

Ravana, chariot lord of fearsome might,
Charged like tempest winds in moonless night.
The earth trembled, and beasts fled in fright,
As Ravana's chariot thundered in its flight.

He summoned mystic missiles, dark and dread,
Called "Tamasa," arrows that made the monkeys dread.
With Brahma's blessing, these arrows consumed,
The monkeys, helpless, as they fled, presumed.

Dust clouds rose, as monkeys ran away,
Tamasa's power none could withstand that day.
Rama, seeing his troops in disarray,
Stood firm, prepared for battle's fierce display.

He grasped his bow, an endless bow it seemed,
The sky itself with its sheer power gleamed.
With quick resolve, the bowstring taut and tight,
He aimed his deadly arrows, full of might.

Lakshmana, too, with prowess unsurpassed,
Shot flaming arrows, fierce and steadfast.
But Ravana's skill, none could ever match,
As arrow met arrow, in the sky's vast patch.

With each clash, the sky grew dark and gray,
A storm of arrows in a deadly ballet.
In circles they danced, left to right, they'd sway,
Two warriors locked in combat, come what may.

Their arrows, swift as lightning bolts, they flew,
A spectacle that made the heavens rue.
With eyes ablaze and hearts with vengeance true,
Rama and Ravana, each other they'd pursue.

Steel arrows, like a deadly serpent's hiss,
On Rama's forehead, Ravana aimed amiss.
But Rama stood unshaken, calm, and blissed,
For his armor bore the blows, no pain to dismiss.

Rama then, with sacred words of might,
Released an arrow, deadly, burning bright.
It pierced the unbreakable armor's might,
And in Ravana's chariot, took its flight.

Undaunted by the strike, his anger stirred,
Ravana, with demon forces, evilly spurred.
Arrows, lion-headed, fierce and keen,
Tiger, buzzard, crow, in a deadly sheen.

Vultures, falcons, jackals in their flight,
Venomous snakes with multiple heads of fright.
Donkeys, boars, dogs, and crows of the night,
All unleashed by Ravana's demon might.

But Rama, fearless, like the god of fire,
Unleashed his own, a force to inspire.
Arrows like the sun, moon, and stars entire,
Planets, meteors, and lightning's radiant wire.

With blazing might, their arrows did entwine,
Clashing in the sky, their deadly sign.
Ravana's arrows, shattered and confined,
In thousands, they fell, a chaotic line.

Seeing Rama's prowess, Ravana's might,
The monkeys cheered, their hearts filled with light.
Victory seemed near, no more a distant sight,
In the midst of battle, they reveled in the fight.

As the duel raged on, with no retreat,
Ravana's missiles, Rama did defeat.
The sky, a canvas for their deadly feat,
A cosmic battle, no mortal could repeat.

With Rama's fiery missile's fierce attack,
Ravana's arrows fell, no turning back.
The monkeys cheered, a mighty, joyous crack,
As Rama's power put the demon on the track.

In the midst of battle's fierce embrace,
Ravana and Rama, face to face,
Their arrows clashed, a furious race,
A war of gods, in that vast open space.

Now Rama's arrows pierced the demon's shield,
His valor unmatched, his aim revealed.
Ravana's eyes, with anger, fierce and peeled,
Yet Rama's strength, he could not yield.

With each stroke, their power fully displayed,
In combat, neither of them swayed.
Arrows met arrows, the sky overlaid,
With fierce confrontation, unafraid.

As Ravana's arrows fell, Rama stood tall,
The battle's victor, above them all.
The monkeys rejoiced with a mighty call,
In the face of darkness, they'd never fall.
