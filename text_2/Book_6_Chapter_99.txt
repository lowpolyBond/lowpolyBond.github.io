A giant, Mahaparshva, was very angry.  Sugriva had just defeated his friend! Mahaparshva shot his arrows at the monkey army.  He was strong and many monkeys were hurt.  They were scared!

Angada, a brave monkey prince, saw his friends hurt. He jumped up, angry! He grabbed a shiny iron bar, like a sunbeam.  He hit Mahaparshva so hard that the giant fell from his chariot!  

Then Jambavan, a strong bear king, smashed the giant's chariot with a huge rock!  It was like hitting it with a mountain!

Mahaparshva got back up!  He shot more arrows at Angada and Jambavan.  He hurt them too!

Angada was furious. He threw the iron bar again!  This time, he knocked the giant's helmet and bow off!  Then he punched Mahaparshva in the ear!

Mahaparshva swung a giant stone axe. But Angada's armor protected him.  Then Angada punched Mahaparshva right in the chest, *bam!*  The giant fell down and died.

The monkey army cheered!  They were so happy!  Their happy shouts were so loud they shook the city of Lanka!  Even the gods cheered!  Ravana, the bad king, got even angrier!
