Lakshmana was amazed by a story Rama told. He asked, "Brother, how did those two great kings get their bodies back?"

Rama started to tell a wonderful tale.  "Long ago," he said, "two wise men, Agastya and Vasishtha, were born from a special jar.  Agastya said he wasn't from that jar and left. Vasishtha became a very important priest for a powerful king."

"Then there was King Nimi," Rama continued.  "When he died, many wise people helped him. They did a special ceremony.  Bhrigu, another wise man, brought him back to life!"

The gods were happy and said, "King Nimi, choose a gift!"

King Nimi said, "I want to live in everyone's eyes!"

The gods said, "It shall be so! You will be the air, and you will make everyone's eyes close to rest."

Then, the wise men rubbed two sticks together, like making a fire.  Suddenly, a new king, Mithi, appeared! He was born from the king's body. That's how the kings got their bodies back, and how Mithi became king!"  Rama finished, "That's the whole story, Lakshmana!"
