Sita was in a hidden place.  Suddenly, she saw a monkey! This monkey was very big and strong.  He was white and shiny, like a bright flower.  At first, Sita was scared!  She thought, "Oh, that monkey is scary!" She was so frightened she cried out, "Rama! Rama! Lakshmana!"  Her voice was weak.

Then, she looked again. The monkey lookedâ€¦different.  He looked respectful.  Sita wondered, "Was that a dream?"

The monkey had some marks on his face.  Sita looked closely.  She realized this was Hanuman, the great monkey general.  She fainted!

When Sita woke up, she was still confused. She thought, "This can't be real! Monkeys aren't supposed to be here! Is everything okay with Rama and Lakshmana? Is my father safe?"

She missed Rama so much.  She thought about him all the time.  She missed his kind face.  Because she missed him so much, she wondered if she was imagining Hanuman.  She talked to the gods, hoping they would help her understand if this monkey was really real, or just a dream. She hoped he was real and that everything would be okay.
