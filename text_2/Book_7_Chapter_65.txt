Shatrughna, a brave prince, walked quickly to a special place after a long journey.  Two days later, he arrived at Valmiki's home. Valmiki was a very wise man.

Shatrughna bowed politely and said, "Wise one, I want to stay here tonight. Tomorrow, I'll leave."

Valmiki smiled. "Welcome, Prince! You're welcome here. Please sit and have some water."

Shatrughna ate some fruit and asked, "Who owns this amazing land over there?"  He pointed to a field.

Valmiki said, "That's a special place.  Long ago, your ancestor, King Saudasa, hunted there. He saw two scary monsters that looked like tigers.  They were eating lots of deer!"

Saudasa was very angry. He killed one monster with his spear. The other monster was sad and angry.  It shouted, "I'll get revenge!" then ran away.

Saudasa's son, Mitrasaha, became king. Saudasa did a big, special ceremony called a sacrifice.  It lasted many years!

The angry monster came back!  It pretended to be Vasishtha, a holy man who helped with the ceremony. The monster tricked Saudasa into offering human meat!

Vasishtha was furious when he found out! He was very angry and he put a curse on Saudasa.  Saudasa's feet became spotted.  That's why he was called Kalmashapada, which means "Spotted Feet."

But Vasishtha was kind.  He said, "The curse will be gone in twelve years, and you won't remember this."

After twelve years, Saudasa was better. He was king again and ruled his people. This land, where the sacrifice happened, is still beautiful today.

Shatrughna thanked Valmiki and went inside his hut.
