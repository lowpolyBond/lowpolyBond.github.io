Indrajit, a powerful demon, was angry.  His uncle, Vibhishana, had spoken wisely, but Indrajit didn't like what he heard.

Indrajit shouted, "Uncle, why are you so scared?  Rama and Lakshmana are just two princes!  Even the weakest demon could beat them! I even defeated Indra, the king of the gods! I made the gods run away!  I'm much stronger than Rama and Lakshmana. Why are you worried?"

Vibhishana calmly replied, "Indrajit, you're too young. You don't understand. You're not thinking clearly. You're helping Ravana, even though he's your enemy.  You shouldn't be here, giving advice. Rama's arrows are like magic! They're unstoppable, like a powerful weapon. It's better to give Sita back to Rama.  Give him lots of treasures and jewels, so we can all be safe."
