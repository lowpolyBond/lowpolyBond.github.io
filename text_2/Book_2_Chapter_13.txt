King Dasaratha was very sad. He felt terrible.  He looked like a king who had fallen from the sky.  His wife, Queen Kaikeyi, was mean. She hadn't gotten what she wanted, and she was still angry.

"King," she said, "you always keep your promises.  Why won't you give me what you promised?"

King Dasaratha was upset. He said, "After I die, you can have what you want. But sending Rama away will be a big lie.  I waited so long for a son, and Rama is such a good boy. He's brave and kind. How can I send him away?"

He went on, "Rama is handsome and kind.  He doesn't deserve to be sad. If I die before Rama suffers, I will be happy in heaven. Kaikeyi, why are you making me do this? I will be ashamed!"

King Dasaratha was so sad. Night came, and he didn't even look at the moon. He wished the night would never end. He didn't want to see Kaikeyi again.

He begged Kaikeyi, "I'm a good king, but I'm dying soon. Please, let Rama be king!  Everyone will be happy, and you'll be famous!"

The king cried.  But Kaikeyi didn't care.  She was stubborn.  King Dasaratha knew he couldn't stop her. He fainted.

He spent the whole night very sad.  In the morning, the musicians started playing to wake him.  But King Dasaratha told them to be quiet. He was too heartbroken.
