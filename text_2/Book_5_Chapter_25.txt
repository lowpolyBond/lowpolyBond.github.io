Sita, a beautiful princess, was surrounded by scary giant women.  They were mean and tried to make her do bad things.  Sita was very scared. She cried and cried.  She told them, "I will never do what you want! I'm not going to marry one of you!"

The giant women were sent by the even scarier Ravana. Sita felt all alone and terrified. She trembled like a little deer lost in the woods, surrounded by wolves.  She held onto a tree branch, so sad she couldn't stop crying.  She missed her husband, Rama, so much.

Sita felt as weak as a tree knocked down in a storm. Her face was pale with fear.  Her long hair swung back and forth like a snake.  She groaned and cried out for Rama, Lakshmana, her mother Kaushalya, and Sumitra.

"It's true what the wise people say," Sita sobbed. "People only die when it's their time.  Even though these mean giants are hurting me and I'm far from Rama, I'm still alive…for now. I'm a bad person, I deserve this. I'm like a boat sinking in a storm. I’m so sad without Rama. I miss his kind eyes and his gentle way of talking. Without him, it's hard to breathe.  Why is this happening to me?  I wish I could die, but I can't escape these giant women.  It's so unfair! Being helpless is the worst thing ever!"
