Prince Rama, the kindest prince, had to leave his home.  Everyone was very sad.  The queen and the ladies cried, "Where is Rama? He's always helped everyone! He was so good and kind to us all!" They missed him terribly.

The king was heartbroken too. He missed his son very much.  He heard the ladies crying, and it made him even sadder.  Nobody felt like cooking food or praying. Even the animals were sad! The elephants didn't want to wear their beautiful clothes, and the cows didn't want to feed their babies.  Moms weren't happy to see their little ones.

The sky looked scary too! The stars were dim, the clouds were dark and stormy, and the whole city shook from an earthquake. It was like the world was crying with them.  Nobody ate or played that day. Everyone was so sad.

Everywhere in the city, people cried.  Friends didn't talk to each other. Brothers and sisters didn't hug.  Husbands and wives weren't happy together. It felt like the sun wasn't shining, and the wind wasn't blowing.  Ayodhya, Rama's city, felt empty and dry, like a desert.  Even the elephants, horses, and soldiers cried.  Everyone missed Rama very much.
