After saying goodbye to their monkey and bear friends, Rama and his brothers lived happily.  One day, a magical flying chariot, called Pushpaka, appeared in the sky!

A voice from the chariot said, "Rama, I'm Pushpaka!  I belong to Kuvera, a powerful king. He sent me to be your chariot because you defeated the bad king Ravana."

Rama was amazed! He said, "Welcome, Pushpaka! Thank you, Kuvera!"  Rama offered Pushpaka tasty treats, flowers, and sweet-smelling perfume.  Then he said, "Go wherever you like, Pushpaka, but come back when I need you."  Pushpaka zoomed away.

Then, Rama's brother Bharata said, "Brother, because of you, everyone is healthy and happy!  People live a long time, and even babies are born without any pain! Everyone loves you!"

Rama was very happy to hear how much his people loved him.  He was a great king, and everyone lived peacefully under his rule.
