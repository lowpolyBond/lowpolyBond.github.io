Once upon a time, a scared giant named Akampana ran to the evil King Ravana.  "King!" he cried, "All my friends are dead!  Only I escaped!"

Ravana's eyes turned red with anger. "Who dared to hurt my friends?" he roared.  "No one, not even the strongest gods, can stop me! I'm the most powerful king!"

Akampana, shaking with fear, told Ravana everything. "It was Rama," he whispered. "He's strong and brave, like a lion! He killed all our best fighters."

Ravana wanted to know if Rama had magical help from the gods.  Akampana said, "No! Rama is amazing all by himself! His arrows flew like magic, turning into scary snakes!"

Ravana was furious! "I'll go and defeat Rama myself!" he shouted.

But Akampana warned him.  "Rama is too strong!  He's almost unbeatable! But there's a way to get him," Akampana said. "Rama loves his wife, Sita, more than anything.  If you steal Sita, Rama will be too sad to fight!"

Ravana liked this plan.  "Tomorrow," he said, "I'll steal Sita!"

The next day, Ravana rode in his shiny chariot. He visited Marica, a clever giant. Ravana told Marica his plan to steal Sita.

But Marica was worried.  "King," he said, "Rama is like a wild elephant!  Heâ€™s too strong to fight. Don't go!  Stay safe with your family!"

Ravana listened to Marica's wise words.  He thought better of it and went back home.  He decided not to fight Rama just yet.
