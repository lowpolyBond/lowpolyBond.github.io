Once upon a time, a kind giantess named Sarama found Sita, Rama's wife, feeling very sad and scared.  Sita was missing Rama.

Sarama, who was very sweet, tried to comfort Sita.  She whispered, "I heard everything Ravana, the mean king, said to you, and I heard your brave answers! Don't worry about Ravana!  Rama is much stronger."

Sarama explained that Rama was a great warrior.  He couldn't be tricked or defeated easily. He had lots of monkey friends who were very strong and brave, just like Rama.  Ravana used magic to fool Sita, but it won't work on Rama!

"Rama and his brother Lakshmana," Sarama said, "have crossed the ocean with their army! They're close! Ravana is scared because he knows Rama is coming!"

Suddenly, Sarama heard a loud noise.  It was Ravana's army coming!  Lots and lots of soldiers and elephants and chariots!  It sounded very scary.

But Sarama smiled and said, "Don't worry! Rama is like a brave superhero. He'll defeat Ravana and rescue you!  Soon, you'll be back in Rama's arms, happy and safe. You'll be together again, and you'll be so joyful!"

Sarama told Sita to have faith in Rama. He was strong, brave, and kind, and he loved Sita very much.  He would come for her, and they would be together again soon.  Sita’s heart filled with hope, ready to wait for her beloved Rama’s return.
