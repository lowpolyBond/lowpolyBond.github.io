One night, everyone listened to a story.  Shatrughna, a brave prince, couldn't sleep.  He was waiting for a fight!

When the sun came up, a scary monster left the city to find food.  Shatrughna, with his bow and arrow, waited by the city gates.

The monster came back, full of food.  He saw Shatrughna and laughed.  "What are you doing with that bow?" he roared. "I've eaten thousands! You're going to be my next meal!"

Shatrughna got really angry.  He was furious!  "I'm Shatrughna," he shouted. "I'm Rama's brother! I'm here to fight you!"

The monster sneered.  "Good!" he said. "Rama killed my relative, Ravana.  Now, I will get revenge! I'll defeat you easily!"

Shatrughna said, "Don't even think about running away! I will defeat you with my arrows, and you will never hurt anyone again!"

The monster said, "Just wait! I'll get my best weapon!"

Shatrughna said, "No way! I won't let you get away!"
