Rama was a super strong prince!  He had already defeated Khara's two mean generals, Dushana and Trishiras. Khara, a big, bad demon, was very scared.  He thought, "Rama defeated my whole army all by himself!"

Khara was angry. He jumped into his chariot and shot many sharp arrows at Rama.  They were like poisonous snakes!  The sky filled with arrows flying from both Rama and Khara!  It got so dark you could hardly see the sun.

Rama fought back! He used his powerful bow and arrows that looked like fire!  Khara was so strong he even broke Rama's bow!  He shot more arrows, hurting Rama.  Rama looked like he was on fire, but he wasn't giving up!

Rama grabbed another, even bigger bow.  This one was super special! He shot arrows with golden feathers.  He knocked Khara's golden flag off his chariot!

Khara got even madder! He shot four arrows right into Rama.  But Rama was amazing! He shot six arrows right back! One hit Khara's head, two hit his arms, and three hit his chest!

Rama wasn't finished!  He shot thirteen more arrows! One arrow broke Khara's chariot. Another arrow hit his driver.  And the last arrow—POW!—hit Khara right in the middle! Khara fell down.

The Gods in the sky cheered! They were so happy that Rama had won!  He was so brave and strong!
