Hanuman, Tara, and Angada, three brave monkeys, went on a big search!  King Sugriva had asked them to find Sita, a princess.

They walked and walked through the Vindhya Mountains.  They looked in caves, climbed over rocky hills, and crossed rivers.  They searched everywhere, but they couldn't find Sita.

The land was very dry and hot.  The monkeys were tired and hungry. They ate roots and fruits to survive.  They couldn't find much food or water.  It was a scary, lonely place with no animals or plants.

Then they found an old, grumpy wizard named Kandu.  He was very angry because his son had died in the forest.  He’d put a magic spell on the land, making it empty and lifeless!

Even though the place was scary, the monkeys kept looking.  They searched every cave and every dark corner.  They still couldn't find Sita or the mean king, Ravana, who had taken her.

Deep in the woods, they saw a HUGE giant! He was so big, he looked like a mountain!  The monkeys huddled together, scared.

The giant shouted, "You're trapped!" and attacked! But Angada, a strong monkey, punched him so hard that the giant fell down like a big rock, and he didn’t get up again.

The monkeys checked the giant's cave, but Sita wasn't there.  They searched another cave too, but no luck.  They were tired and sad.  They sat down under a tree to rest, ready to keep searching another day.
