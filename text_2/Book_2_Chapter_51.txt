A kind forest man named Guha saw Lakshmana guarding his brother Rama.  "Sleep, friend," Guha said. "You're used to comfy beds, not the forest.  I'll watch over Rama. He's the most important person to me." Guha promised to protect Rama and Sita all night. He knew the forest well and wasn't afraid of anyone.

But Lakshmana wouldn't sleep.  "I trust you, Guha," he said, "but how can I leave Rama?  He's the king's son, and he's sleeping on the ground!"  Lakshmana was very sad.  He thought about his father, King Dasaratha.  The king was very old and very upset that Rama was sent away.  Lakshmana worried his father wouldn't live long without Rama.  He worried his mother and the queen would also die of sadness.

Lakshmana imagined his beautiful city, Ayodhya.  He pictured the happy people, the pretty palaces, and the fun celebrations.  He wondered if he would ever see it again. He missed his home terribly.  He was so sad he cried.

So, Lakshmana stayed awake all night, keeping watch over his brother Rama.  Even Guha, the strong forest man, felt sad and cried with Lakshmana.  Lakshmana missed his family and his home very much.
