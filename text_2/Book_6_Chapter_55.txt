King Ravana was angry.  One of his best fighters, Vajradamshtra, had been killed! He called his strongest general, Akampana.

"Akampana," Ravana boomed, "lead your army against Rama's monkey soldiers!  They are strong, but you are stronger!  You will win!"

Akampana was huge and scary! He looked like a dark cloud, and his voice sounded like thunder. He rode a golden chariot, surrounded by scary demons.  But even Akampana felt a little uneasy. Before the battle even started, his left eye twitched!  A bad wind blew, and the birds cried sadly.  But Akampana was brave, and he rushed into battle anyway.

The battle was HUGE! Monkeys and demons fought with everything they had.  They swung trees, threw rocks, and fought with spears.  So much dust flew up, you couldn't see anything! It was like a giant, brown cloud. Monkeys fought other monkeys, demons fought other demons, it was complete chaos!  The ground was covered in blood.

Then the monkeys fought back!  Three brave monkey leaders, Kumuda, Nala, and Mainda, were super strong. They jumped and swung their tree weapons, smashing the demons. The monkeys were winning!  They broke the demons' weapons and beat them badly. Akampana tried to encourage his army, but it was no use.  The monkeys were too strong!
