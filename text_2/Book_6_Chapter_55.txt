Note from Griffith:

I omit Cantos LV, LVI, LVII, and LVIII, which relate how Akampan and
Prahasta sally out and fall. There is little novelty of incident in these
Cantos and the results are exactly the same as before. In Canto LV,
Akampan, at the command of Rávaṇ, leads forth his troops. Evil omens are
seen and heard. The enemies meet, and many fall on each side, the Vánars
transfixed with arrows, the Rákshases crushed with rocks and trees.
