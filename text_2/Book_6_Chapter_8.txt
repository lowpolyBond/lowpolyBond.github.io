King Ravana's strong generals were very angry about Hanuman.  Prahasta, a huge and strong giant, said, "We can beat anyone!  Those monkeys are no match for us!  I will get rid of that monkey, Hanuman, and all his friends!"

Durmukha, another strong giant, shouted, "Hanuman ruined our city! I will hunt him down, no matter where he hides!"

Vajradamshtra, a giant with a bloody mace, roared, "Rama, Lakshmana, and Sugriva are puny compared to me! I'll kill them all today!"  He had another plan too: "Let's trick Rama. We'll pretend to be friends, and then attack him and his monkey army!"

Nikumbha, another powerful giant, said, "I'll do it myself! I will kill Rama, Lakshmana, Sugriva, Hanuman, and all the monkeys!"

Finally, Vajrabanu, a giant as tall as a mountain, said, "Relax everyone!  I'll take care of the whole monkey army all by myself.  Have a drink while I get rid of Sugriva, Lakshmana, Hanuman, Angada, and every last monkey!"

All of Ravana's strong generals wanted to fight Hanuman and his monkey army. They all boasted of how easily they would defeat them!
