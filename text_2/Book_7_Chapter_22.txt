Once upon a time, King Yama, the god of death, heard a big noise.  His army had lost a battle!  He was very angry.  "Drive my chariot quickly!" he shouted to his driver.

Zoom!  His amazing chariot flew through the sky.  Mrityu, the destroyer, stood beside him, holding a scary weapon that shone like fire.  Everyone in the world was scared!

The chariot raced to where Ravana, the powerful demon king, was fighting.  Ravana's army ran away when they saw Yama's scary chariot.  But Ravana wasn't scared!

Yama and Ravana fought for seven whole days!  Yama shot lots of arrows, but Ravana was strong and didn't get hurt.  Then Ravana shot back, even hitting Yama many times!

Other gods and magical beings came to watch the amazing fight.  It looked like the whole world might end!  Yama got even angrier.  He almost used his powerful weapon of death.

Mrityu, beside Yama, said, "Let me kill this bad demon! I've killed giants and monsters before!  My power is unstoppable!"

But Yama said, "I'll kill him!"  He raised his special weapon, a rod that could kill anyone.  It was so powerful, it would destroy everything!

Suddenly, Brahma, the creator god, appeared!  "Stop!" he cried. "I gave Ravana a special gift. You can't kill him!" Brahma explained that using the rod would break his promise and cause terrible trouble.

Yama listened to Brahma.  He couldn't kill Ravana.  "I'll disappear," he said.  Poof!  Yama and his chariot vanished.

Ravana won the fight! He went home on his flying chariot. Yama and the other gods went back to heaven, a little bit sad but happy that everything was okay.  Even Narada, the storyteller, went back to spread the news.
