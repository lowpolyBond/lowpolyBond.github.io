Rama told his messengers to hurry to Madhura.  They traveled quickly and told Shatrughna some big news.  Rama had sent Lakshmana away.  He had made a promise. He put his two sons in charge.  Rama had built a beautiful city called Kushavati for his son Kusha.  Lava’s city was called Shravasti.  Rama and his brother Bharata were going to a magical place called Svarga, and they wanted everyone from Ayodhya to come too!

The messengers told Shatrughna to hurry! Shatrughna was worried.  He called everyone together and his priest. He told them he was leaving for Ayodhya.

Shatrughna put his two sons in charge of his cities.  Then, he took a chariot to Ayodhya.

He saw Rama with wise people.  Shatrughna bowed and said, “I’ve made my sons kings. I’m coming with you!” Rama said, “Okay.”

Then, lots of monkeys, bears, and giants came! They were led by Sugriva, Rama’s friend.  They wanted to go to Svarga with Rama too!  Gods, wise people, and magical beings also came. They all wanted to go with Rama!

Sugriva said he had made Angada king, and was ready to go. Rama smiled and said, “Okay.”

Rama talked to Vibhishana, the king of the demons.  Rama said, "Rule Lanka well! As long as people remember me, your kingdom will last.  Worship Shri Jagannath, a very important god." Vibhishana said, "Okay."

Rama spoke to Hanuman, the strong monkey. He said, "As long as people tell my story, you will be happy!" Hanuman was very happy.

Rama told Jambavan, the wise bear, to stay on Earth until the Kali Yuga. Then, Rama told all the monkeys and bears, “If you want to come with me, come on!”
