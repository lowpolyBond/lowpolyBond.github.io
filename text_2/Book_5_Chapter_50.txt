Ravana, a powerful king, saw a big, strong monkey.  He was very angry!  Ravana thought, "Is this Nandi, who tricked me once? Or is he Bali's son?"

Ravana's friend, Prahasta, was told to ask the monkey questions.  "Monkey," Prahasta said, "tell us why you're here!  Are you a messenger from a god?  Tell the truth, or you'll be in trouble!"

The monkey, whose name was Hanuman, answered, "I'm just a monkey! I came to see King Ravana.  I fought some guards to get here.  I'm very strong, even stronger than many gods! I let them catch me because I'm helping Prince Rama.  I'm Rama's messenger.  Listen to me, King Ravana, and it will be good for you!"
