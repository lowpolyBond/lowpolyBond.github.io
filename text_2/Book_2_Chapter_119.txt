Once upon a time, Sita, Rama's beautiful wife, met a kind old woman named Anasuya.  Anasuya listened to Sita's story.  She hugged Sita and smelled her lovely hair.

"Your story is wonderful," Anasuya said.  "But the sun is setting. Look! The birds are going home to sleep. The wise men are coming back from their baths.  The night is coming!"

Anasuya gave Sita pretty clothes and jewelry.  "Go and make your husband, Rama, happy," she said.

Sita put on the beautiful things. She touched Anasuya's feet to show her thanks, and then went to find Rama.

Rama was so happy to see Sita all dressed up! Sita told him about Anasuya's kindness and showed him her gifts. Rama and his brother Lakshmana were very pleased.

The next morning, Rama and Lakshmana went to see the wise men. The wise men said, "Prince Rama, this forest is dangerous!  Evil creatures live here. They eat people! Please, protect us!"

Rama promised to help. He went into the forest, strong and brave, just like the sun bursting through dark clouds.  The end.
