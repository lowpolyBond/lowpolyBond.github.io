King Ravana's army was losing!  Hanuman, a strong monkey, had already defeated five of Ravana's best generals.  Ravana looked at his young son, Aksha. Aksha was brave and ready to fight. He jumped into his amazing chariot!

This chariot was super special! It was made of gold, had lots of flags, and was pulled by eight super-fast horses.  It was so shiny, it looked like lightning! It was full of weapons: swords, arrows, and spears.  Aksha and his army roared towards Hanuman who was guarding the gate.

Aksha looked at Hanuman. Hanuman was huge and strong, like a giant fire.  Aksha felt proud and brave. He aimed his bow and shot three sharp arrows at Hanuman!

Hanuman didn't even flinch!  He was used to fighting.  Aksha fought hard, but Hanuman was even stronger.  The ground shook! The sun hid behind the clouds! Even the wind stopped blowing!  It was a HUGE battle!

Hanuman was hurt, but he was still strong. He was like the sun, even with arrows sticking out of him!  Seeing Aksha's amazing chariot and weapons, Hanuman got even angrier. He looked at Aksha, and BAM!  He used his fiery eyes to defeat Aksha and his whole army!

Aksha tried again. He shot so many arrows, it looked like rain!  But Hanuman was too fast! He dodged every arrow.  Aksha, still angry, charged at Hanuman. He threw lots of arrows, like a storm of hail.

Hanuman thought about Aksha.  He was young, but so brave and strong!  Hanuman didn't want to kill him, but he had to win.  So, he used his super strength.  He hit Aksha's chariot so hard that it crashed!  

Aksha jumped out and tried to fight, but Hanuman was too quick. He grabbed Aksha and spun him around and around, then threw him to the ground!  Aksha was badly hurt.

Hanuman sadly defeated Aksha.  All the gods and other magical creatures watched in amazement.  Then, Hanuman went back to the gate, ready for anyone else who dared to challenge him. He was like a scary ghost, waiting for more enemies!
