Rama, a brave prince, wanted to cross the ocean.  He was angry! He told the ocean, "I'll dry you up with my arrows!"  He aimed his powerful arrow, and whoosh!  The earth shook! The sky turned dark!  The wind howled!  Even the sun and moon wobbled!  The ocean was scared!

Big waves crashed!  Then, the king of the ocean, Sagara, rose from the waves.  He was beautiful, covered in jewels and surrounded by swirling water.  He begged Rama to stop.  "I can't dry up," he said. "But I'll help you cross!"

Rama asked, "Where should I shoot my arrow?" Sagara pointed to a bad place full of thieves.  Rama shot his arrow, and whoosh! A big desert appeared!  He made it a good place, full of food and plants.

Then Sagara said, "My friend Nala, a clever monkey, can build a bridge."  Nala, a strong monkey, promised to build a bridge across the ocean.  He and his monkey friends worked hard! They carried huge rocks and trees.  They worked day and night.

The monkeys were amazing!  They built fourteen leagues of the bridge the first day!  Then twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two, and twenty-three leagues in the following days! The bridge was huge and strong, shining like a star in the sky!  Even the gods were amazed!

Rama, Lakshmana, and their monkey friends walked across the amazing bridge.  The gods cheered! They knew Rama was going to win!  They blessed him and said, "Rule the earth and the sea!"  Rama's army was ready for the next part of their journey!
