Once upon a time, in a kingdom far away, lived King Janaka. He was a very kind king.  He wanted to tell a wise old man, a sage named Vasishtha, all about his family.

"Hello, Sage Vasishtha," King Janaka said. "I want to tell you about my family history, so you know who I am.  A long, long time ago, there was a great king named Nimi. He was very good and honest.  Nimi had a son, then his son had a son, and so on, and so on!  Lots and lots of kings followed each other, one after the other, until it was my turn to be king."

King Janaka explained that many kings came before him.  He told the sage about all his ancestors,  mentioning their names one by one – Mithi, Udavasu, Nandivardhana, Suketu, and many more. He even told Vasishtha that his father had left the kingdom to him. He loved his younger brother Kushadvaja very much and took care of him.

Then, something bad happened! Another king, King Sudhanva, attacked Janaka's kingdom! He demanded King Janaka’s daughter, Sita, and a special magical bow. King Janaka said no!  A big battle happened, and King Sudhanva was defeated. Afterwards, King Janaka gave his brother the kingdom of Sankasya.

Now, it was time for a happy event! King Janaka wanted to give his daughter Sita to Rama, a very brave prince. He also wanted to give his other daughter, Urmila, to Rama’s brother Lakshmana.

"I'm so happy to give my daughters to your sons!" King Janaka said to Rama's father.  He asked Rama and Lakshmana to give away gifts like cows and seeds to celebrate.

"The stars are just right," King Janaka said. "Let's get married in three days' time!"  And so, the wedding preparations began.  Everyone was excited for the big day!
