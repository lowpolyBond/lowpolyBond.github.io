Rama won the war!  He defeated the evil king Ravana and rescued his wife, Sita.  Now, it was time to go home.

A beautiful flying chariot, called Pushpaka, was all ready. Bibishana, the good king of the demons who helped Rama, asked, "What should I do now, Rama?"

Rama smiled.  "The monkey army helped me so much," he said.  "They were brave and fought hard.  Give them lots of gold and jewels as a thank you, Bibishana.  They deserve it!"

Bibishana happily gave the monkeys and bears lots of shiny treasures. They were so happy!

Then, Rama, Sita, and his brother Lakshmana got into the Pushpaka chariot.  Rama stood up and said goodbye to his friends.

"Thank you, Sugriva," Rama said to the monkey king. "You and your army were amazing! Go back to your home in Kishkinda."

He smiled at Bibishana.  "Bibishana, you are the new king of Lanka! Rule wisely and well!"

The monkeys cheered. They all wanted to go to Ayodhya, Rama's home, with him.

"We want to come with you!" they shouted.

Rama was happy.  "Great!" he said. "Everyone, get in the chariot!"

Sugriva and the monkeys, and Bibishana and his helpers, all climbed into the magical chariot.  With a whoosh, the Pushpaka flew into the sky!  It was a beautiful sight!  Rama, Sita, Lakshmana, the monkeys, and the others all flew home together, happy and excited.
