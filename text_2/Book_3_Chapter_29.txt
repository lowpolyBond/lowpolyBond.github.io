Rama, a strong and brave prince, faced Khara, a mean giant. Khara had a big army of elephants, horses, and soldiers.  Rama said, "Khara, you're hurting innocent people!  Being mean and cruel doesn't bring happiness, even if you're super powerful.  It's like a snake—it might be strong, but it will get hurt in the end."

Rama reminded Khara about the forest monks Khara had killed.  "Being mean doesn't make you a good king," Rama said.  "Bad things always have bad results, like swallowing poison. I'm here to stop you from hurting others!"  Rama promised to punish Khara for his evil deeds.  He said the dead monks would see him get what he deserved.

Khara was angry. He laughed and said, "Rama, you’re just a man! You’re bragging.  Real heroes don’t boast. You’re like fake gold – you look good but aren't really strong." Khara said he was powerful and would defeat Rama. He even threatened to destroy the whole world!  He said he was going to avenge his dead friends.

Khara threw his big, shiny mace at Rama. It looked like a shooting star, burning up everything in its path. But Rama was faster!  He shot his arrows and smashed the mace into pieces before it hit him.  The mace fell to the ground, broken like a dead snake.
