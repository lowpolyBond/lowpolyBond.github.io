Lakshmana was very sad.  His brother, Rama, was going away.  He was angry! He felt like a snake in a hole, hissing and ready to strike.  He looked like a grumpy lion!

"Brother!" Lakshmana roared. "This is wrong!  It's not fair that you have to leave!  Our father and stepmother, Kaikeyi, tricked you! They're being mean!"

Lakshmana was upset that Rama was obeying his father's unfair order to go into exile. He said, "They're liars! They're making you leave so Bharata can be king.  You're strong! Don't let them push you around! Why listen to them?"

Lakshmana explained, "True heroes don't just let fate decide everything. They fight for what's right! I won't let this happen! I'll fight anyone who tries to stop you from becoming king!"

Lakshmana promised to fight for Rama.  He said, "My sword and bow aren't just for show! I'll defeat anyone who stands in your way. I'll protect you, even if it means fighting gods!"

Rama loved Lakshmana, but he was firm. He wiped away his tears and said, "My dear brother, I must obey my father.  It's the right thing to do, even if it's hard."
