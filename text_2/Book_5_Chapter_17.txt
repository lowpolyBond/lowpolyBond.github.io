The moon rose, bright and shiny like a water lily.  It shone on Hanuman, the monkey.

Hanuman saw Sita.  She looked very sad.  She was like a ship lost at sea.  Around Sita were many scary giant women!

These women were very strange. Some had only one eye. Some had huge heads.  Some had noses on their foreheads!  They were grumpy and carried big spears and hammers.  They looked like a mix of animals – tigers, elephants, even jackals!

Sita was very unhappy.  She missed Rama very much. She looked sad and dusty, like a fallen star.  She was all alone, without her pretty jewelry.  She was like a beautiful flower covered in mud.

Even though Sita was sad and dirty, Hanuman could see she was still beautiful. Her eyes were big and bright like a deer’s.  She was sighing, and her sadness was huge like a big ocean wave.

Hanuman was so happy to see Sita! He felt like crying happy tears.  He quietly bowed to Rama and Lakshmana, and hid himself. He had found Sita!
