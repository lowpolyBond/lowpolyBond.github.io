Ravana was furious!  His strong warriors, Mahodara, Mahaparshva, and Virupaksha, were all defeated.  He wanted revenge.

"I will defeat Rama and Lakshmana!" Ravana roared to his driver.  "They killed my best fighters and are attacking my city! I'll stop them!" He thought of Rama as a big tree, and Sita was its beautiful flower.  Sugriva, Hanuman, and all the monkey soldiers were its branches.

Ravana's chariot zoomed towards Rama. The ground shook!  Animals ran in fear.  Then, Ravana used a powerful, dark magic weapon!  It was scary!  The monkey soldiers scattered, running everywhere.

Rama and Lakshmana stood strong, like brave heroes. Rama's bow was huge; he looked as tall as the sky.  Ravana had defeated the monkeys, but Rama and Lakshmana were still ready to fight.

Rama grabbed his bow. It was strong and made a loud *twang!*  When Ravana shot many arrows, and Rama pulled his bow, lots of soldiers fell down. Ravana zoomed close!

Lakshmana, Rama's brother, shot arrows like fiery spears!  Ravana was fast.  He knocked down Lakshmana's arrows, one by one, three by three, and ten by ten.  He was very skillful!

Then, Ravana attacked Rama!  They shot arrows at each other â€“ whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!  The sky was filled with flying arrows, like a huge storm.  It was a super exciting battle!

Ravana aimed at Rama's head, but Rama didn't flinch!  He used a special weapon, and it was like lots of magical snakes fighting Ravana. Ravana then used his own magic weapon! It shot scary arrows with the heads of lions, tigers, and other animals!

Rama fired back with his own powerful arrows! They were like bright stars and shooting suns.  The arrows from both sides crashed and disappeared in the sky.

The monkeys cheered! They saw Rama had defeated Ravana's magic weapon. Rama smiled. He had won this part of the battle.  The monkey leaders bowed to him.
