King Dasaratha was planning a big ceremony. His advisor, Sumantra, told him a secret story.  "A long time ago," Sumantra said, "a wise man named Sanatkumara predicted that you would have a son!"

This son would come because of a special sage named Rishyasringa. Rishyasringa lived in the forest with his father. He was very holy and only knew his father and never met anyone else. He prayed and did ceremonies every day.

Far away, a king named Lomapada was very mean.  He was so bad that it caused a terrible drought! No rain fell.  Lomapada asked his wise men, "What can I do?  How can I make the rain come back?"

The wise men said, "Bring Rishyasringa to your kingdom!  Give him your daughter, Princess Shanta, to marry."

Lomapada tried to get Rishyasringa, but everyone was too scared! The wise men finally had an idea.  "We need to send beautiful ladies," they said, "to invite him."

The ladies tricked Rishyasringa, and he came to the kingdom. The rain started falling!  Lomapada married his daughter to Rishyasringa.  And because Rishyasringa was so holy, he helped Lomapada get a son!

"This," Sumantra finished, "is how Sanatkumara said you will get your son, your Majesty!" King Dasaratha was very excited to hear this amazing story. He wanted to hear more about how it happened.
