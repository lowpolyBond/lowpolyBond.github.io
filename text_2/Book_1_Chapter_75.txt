Once upon a time, a very strong warrior named Parasurama heard about Rama.  Rama was famous for breaking a super strong bow! Parasurama said, "Rama, I have a powerful bow too! Try to string it and shoot an arrow. If you can, we can have a fair fight!"

King Dasaratha, Rama's dad, was worried. He said to Parasurama, "Please be kind! Rama is still young. You're a wise and powerful holy man, and youâ€™ve promised not to fight anymore.  Please don't hurt him!"

But Parasurama wouldn't listen. He told Rama, "This bow is amazing! It was made by a great magical craftsman.  Even Lord Shiva, a powerful god, used a bow like this! You broke Shiva's bow, so now try mine!"

Parasurama explained a long-ago fight between the gods Vishnu and Shiva.  They fought using these special bows. Vishnu's bow won, and eventually, it came to Parasurama's father.  Parasurama's father was a great warrior but gave up fighting. Sadly, he was killed, and Parasurama was very angry. He fought many battles to get revenge!  He later gave away his kingdom and became a peaceful hermit.  But now he wanted to see if Rama was as strong as he was. "Try this bow, Rama!" he said. "If you can use it, we will fight!"
