Rama was a mighty warrior! He fought a huge battle.  Thousands of elephants, horses, and soldiers on chariots fought for the demons.  But Rama's magic arrows, shining like gold, defeated them all!

The demons who survived were terrified.  The demon women cried and wailed.  They wondered why Shurpanakha, a mean, old demon, had bothered Rama.  Rama was so handsome and kind!  Shurpanakha, who was ugly and bad, wanted Rama for herself.  This made Rama angry.

Because of Shurpanakha's actions, Ravana, a powerful demon king, kidnapped Sita, Rama's wife!  The demon women remembered how Rama had already defeated many other demons. He'd beaten Viradha, a scary demon, and thousands of others.  He even killed Khara and Dushana, two powerful demons. He even defeated the huge Kabandha and Bali. He even helped Sugriva, a monkey king, win back his kingdom.

The demons had good advice from Ravana's brother, Vibhishana, but Ravana didn't listen.  Ravana lost many powerful demons, like Kumbhakarna and Indrajit, in battle against Rama.

"Our sons, brothers, and kings are dead!" cried the demon women.  "Rama is so strong! He's like a god! We have no hope!"

They knew Ravana's power came from magic, but this magic couldn't save him from Rama.  Long ago, a powerful god had said that demons would be destroyed by a hero.  It seems that hero is Rama.

Ravana had stolen Sita, and that was his biggest mistake.  The demon women knew they were defeated.  They were trapped, like elephants in a burning forest, with no escape. Only Vibhishana, who was wise, had escaped to join Rama before it was too late.  The demon women cried and hugged each other, feeling hopeless and sad.
