Once upon a time, a good king named Kushanabha wanted a son.  He did a special ceremony, like a big prayer.  A wise man named Kusha told him, "You'll have a son, and you should name him Gadhi. He'll be very famous!"

And guess what? King Kushanabha had a son! He named him Gadhi, just like the wise man said.  Gadhi grew up to be a good king too.  Now, listen carefully, because this is important:  Vishvamitra, a very powerful wise man, was Gadhi's grandson!  That's why Vishvamitra was called Kaushika, because he came from the family of Kusha.

Vishvamitra had a sister named Satyavati. She married a man named Richika, but he died.  Satyavati was so good and kind, she went to heaven and became a beautiful river!  This river is called the Kaushiki River, and it flows near the big mountains.  Vishvamitra loved his sister very much, so he lived near the Kaushiki River.

One day, Vishvamitra was talking to Rama and his brother Lakshmana. He told them all about his family.  He said, "I went to a special place to pray, and now I'm done! I've told you my story. It's getting late. Let's sleep!"

It was a beautiful night.  The stars shone like tiny diamonds in the sky.  The moon was bright, and it slowly climbed higher and higher.  Even though it was a beautiful night, there were also scary creatures like yakshas, who walked around in the darkness.

After Vishvamitra finished his story, the other wise men said, "That was a great story!" They said Vishvamitra's family was always good and kind.  They also said that the Kaushiki River was very special.

Then everyone went to sleep. Rama and Lakshmana were amazed by Vishvamitra's story. They went to sleep too, ready for their adventure the next day.
