Ravana, a very bad king, was flying home in his magic flying chariot, the Pushpaka. He was happy because he had kidnapped lots of princesses!  He took them whenever he saw a pretty girl. He would even kill her family and friends!  Poor princesses from all over the land – snake people, giants, and even gods’ daughters – were crying in the Pushpaka. They were scared and missed their homes.

The princesses were so sad! They missed their moms, dads, husbands, and brothers. They cried, "What will happen to my son without me? What about my mother?"  They were very, very afraid.  Some wondered if Ravana would eat them!  Others thought he would kill them.

They cried out, "This is terrible! Ravana is the worst! He killed our husbands and families! He's mean and he takes what doesn't belong to him. Because of him, a woman will cause his death!"  As they cried, the sky shone brightly and flowers rained down.

Ravana, hearing their sadness, felt a little less powerful.  When he landed in his city, Lanka, his sister, Shurpanakha, ran to him.  She was crying too!  Ravana had accidentally killed her husband in a battle.  He hadn't even known it was her husband!

Ravana felt bad. He told Shurpanakha, "Don't cry!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to. I was just fighting and didn't see it was your husband."  He gave Shurpanakha a huge army of 14,000 soldiers to lead, and sent them to guard a forest for her. Shurpanakha was happy to have her own army and moved to live near her cousin, Khara, who was in charge.
