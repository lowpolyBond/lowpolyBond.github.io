Bharata woke up.  He was sad and crying. He saw his mother, Queen Kaushalya, very upset.  He told her, "I never wanted to be king! I was far away with my brother Shatrughna. I didn't know about Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana going to the forest. I'm so sorry!"

Queen Kaushalya heard Bharata crying.  She told another queen, Sumitra, "Bharata is here. I want to see him."

Queen Kaushalya was very weak and sad because Rama was gone.  She went to see Bharata and Shatrughna.  They were all very sad and cried together.  Queen Kaushalya hugged Bharata and cried, "Your mother, Kaikeyi, made you king!  Why did she send my Rama away? I want to go with him!  Please, Bharata, take me to Rama!"

Bharata felt terrible. He was hurt by Queen Kaushalya's words.  He bowed down and said, "Mother, I love Rama very much.  I didn't do anything wrong!  May Kaikeyi be punished for sending Rama away! May she suffer for what she did!"  Bharata wished many bad things would happen to Kaikeyi for being so mean.  He listed many, many bad things!

Queen Kaushalya said, "My son, your words hurt me, but I'm glad you love Rama so much. You'll be happy again."

The queen held Bharata close and cried. Bharata cried too.  They were all so sad and spent a long, sad night together.
