It was still dark outside, but almost morning.  Musicians started playing beautiful music to celebrate Prince Bharata.  Big drums boomed, horns blew, and lots of instruments played.

But Bharata was very sad.  He didn't want the music.  "I'm not the king!" he cried.  He told his brother, Shatrughna, "This music is wrong!  Queen Kaikeyi was mean. She sent our brother Rama away!  Our father, the king, is gone, and our kingdom feels lost like a ship without a captain."  The palace women started crying too.

Then, a very wise and important man, Sage Vasishtha, came into the beautiful golden palace.  He was like a super important teacher to the royal family. He sat on a fancy golden throne and said, "Quick!  We need all the important people!  The wise men, the soldiers, the leaders, and the princesâ€”everyone! We have a big problem to solve!"

Lots of people rushed in on chariots, horses, and elephants!  When they saw Bharata, they felt happy, like they saw their father, King Dasaratha, again. The palace was shining with so many important people. It looked as beautiful as the ocean with whales and sparkling sand.
