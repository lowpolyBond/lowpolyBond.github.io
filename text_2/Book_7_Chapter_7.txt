Once upon a time, a scary battle happened!  Lots of mean Rakshasas (monsters) attacked Vishnu, a powerful god. They threw so many weapons, it looked like a rain of arrows!  It was like a swarm of bees around a honey pot!

Vishnu was strong!  He fought back!  He shot his arrows like lightning.  Whoosh!  They flew super fast, hitting lots and lots of Rakshasas. Then, he blew his amazing conch shell!  *Booooom!*  The sound was so loud, it shook the whole world!  The Rakshasas were scared! Their elephants got wobbly, and their horses couldn't stand.

Vishnu's arrows were sharp like diamonds.  They went whizzing through the air, hitting the Rakshasas.  The monsters fell down like rocks hit by lightning!  Vishnu was so strong, he cut off their heads and smashed their weapons.

The Rakshasas ran away like mice from a cat! Some escaped, but lots and lots fell down.  Vishnu was like a lion chasing scared mice!

One brave Rakshasa named Sumali tried to fight Vishnu again.  He threw many darts, but Vishnu was too strong!  Vishnu even cut off Sumali's chariot driver's head!

Another Rakshasa, Mali, jumped in to fight. He shot many arrows at Vishnu, but Vishnu didn't even flinch!  He fought back, and knocked Mali's crown and weapons off!  Mali hit Vishnu's bird, Garuda, but Garuda carried Vishnu away.

Vishnu was angry that Garuda got hurt. He threw his super shiny discus (a flying weapon) and chopped off Mali's head! The other gods cheered, "Hooray for Vishnu!"

Sumali and his friends ran away to Lanka.  Garuda, all better now, chased the rest of the Rakshasas away with his giant wings.  Lots of Rakshasas fell from the sky into the sea.  Vishnu won the battle! He was very, very powerful!
