Rama rescued Sita from the evil king Ravana! He was so happy to have her back. He told Sita, "My dear Sita, I fought hard and won!  Ravana is defeated, and I kept my promise to bring you home."

Rama also praised his friends, Hanuman, Sugriva, and Vibhishana.  Hanuman was brave, Sugriva was a good leader, and Vibhishana was smart to help Rama.

But then, Rama said something sad.  He felt worried what other people might think about Sita being with Ravana.  He told Sita, "I won the battle, and I rescued you.  But... I'm worried about what people will say.  You are free to go wherever you want.  You can live with my brothers, Lakshmana, Bharata, or Shatrughna. You can even stay with Sugriva or Vibhishana."

Sita was heartbroken.  Rama's words were like a sharp knife to her heart.  She cried and cried, sad and alone, like a vine pulled down by a big elephant.  She was so very upset that her beloved Rama was sending her away.
