Once upon a time, a mean king named Ravana, disguised as a poor man, met Sita.  Sita was a kind princess, married to the brave Prince Rama.

Ravana asked Sita about herself. Sita, being polite, told him everything. She explained that her husband, Rama, was supposed to be king. But a wicked stepmother, Kaikeyi, tricked Rama's father into sending Rama, Sita, and Rama's brother Lakshmana to live in the forest for fourteen years!  Rama was a good and strong prince, so he obeyed his father even though it wasn't fair.  Lakshmana, Rama's brave brother, went with them.

Sita told Ravana that they were living a simple life in the forest, hunting and gathering food.

Ravana then revealed his true self! He was a powerful, scary king who wanted Sita to be his queen! He offered her a beautiful palace and many servants.

But Sita was very brave. She refused!  She said Rama was strong and brave like a lion, while Ravana was weak and mean like a jackal. She said she would never leave her husband. She told Ravana that trying to take her was like trying to catch the sun, or lift a mountain with your hands â€“ impossible!

Ravana, angry that Sita refused him, tried to scare her with stories of his power.  But Sita stayed strong, even though she was scared. She knew Rama would find her.
