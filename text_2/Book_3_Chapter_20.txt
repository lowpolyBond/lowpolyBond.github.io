Once upon a time, in a magical forest, lived Rama, his brother Lakshmana, and his wife Sita.  They lived in a simple hut.  A mean, grumpy demon lady named Shurpanakha came to their hut. She was very jealous of Sita's beauty.  She showed some other demons where Rama and Sita lived.

Rama saw the demons and said to Lakshmana, "Stay here with Sita, I'll take care of these bad guys!" Lakshmana said, "Okay!"

Rama, a very strong and brave warrior, pointed his shiny golden bow at the demons. He told them, "We are Rama and Lakshmana. We live here peacefully.  Why are you bothering us?"

The fourteen grumpy demons laughed.  "You can't beat us all!" they shouted, throwing their spears.

But Rama was super fast!  He shot his arrows, *whoosh whoosh whoosh!*  His arrows were like magic, hitting the demons right in the chest.  The demons fell down, just like trees falling in a storm!

Shurpanakha, the mean demon lady, watched her friends fall.  She was furious!  She ran away to tell her brother, Khara, all about it.  She cried and screamed, telling him how Rama had defeated his soldiers.  She was very, very angry.  And that's how Rama showed the demons that messing with him and his family was a very bad idea!
