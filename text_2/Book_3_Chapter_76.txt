Rama and his brother Lakshmana were very sad.  They had just visited some amazing holy people.  They saw peaceful tigers, deer, and birds all living together happily.  They even bathed in seven beautiful lakes!

But Rama was still thinking about his missing wife, Sita. He said to Lakshmana, "Let's go to the river Pampá.  Near there, on Mount Rishyamuka, lives Sugriva, a powerful monkey king.  I hope he can help us find Sita!"

Lakshmana said, "Let's go, brother! I want to help find Sita too!"

So they walked and walked.  The forest was full of colorful birds – parrots squawking, peacocks showing off their feathers!  They saw pretty flowers and sparkling rivers.  They even stopped to bathe in a river called Matanga.

Finally, they reached the beautiful river Pampá.  It was full of lotus flowers and mango trees.  Pretty birds sang everywhere.  The water was so clear you could see the fish and turtles swimming below.

But seeing all this beauty only made Rama sadder. He cried to Lakshmana, "Look! There’s Mount Rishyamuka! Sugriva lives there. He's a strong monkey king.  I have to ask him for help to find Sita. I can’t live without her!"

Rama felt very sad and walked slowly. Lakshmana stayed by his side, ready to help his brother find Sita.  They continued their journey towards Sugriva, hoping he could help them bring Sita home.
