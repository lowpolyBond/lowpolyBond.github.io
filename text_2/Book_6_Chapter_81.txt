Indrajit, the clever son of Ravana, saw Rama and Lakshmana coming to fight.  He tricked them!  He quickly ran back into the city.

Ravana, Indrajit's dad, was furious about the brave fighters he'd lost.  He stormed out of the city gates, ready for a battle with his army of giants.  Indrajit used magic. He made a fake Sita appear in a chariot!  She looked very sad and weak.

The monkey army saw her!  Hanuman, the strongest monkey, saw fake Sita. She looked really thin and dirty.  He was shocked! He'd seen the real Sita recently.  He wondered, "What is Indrajit planning?"

Indrajit, pretending to be angry, swung his sword at fake Sita.  Fake Sita cried out, "Rama! Rama!"

Hanuman was heartbroken.  Tears came to his eyes. He yelled at Indrajit, "You cruel monster! Why are you hurting her? You'll pay for this!  You'll go to the worst hell for hurting a woman!"

Indrajit laughed.  "I'm going to kill the real Sita!" he shouted. "Then I'll kill Rama, Lakshmana, and everyone else!" He didn't care about the rule against hurting women; he just wanted to win the battle.

Then, Indrajit killed the *fake* Sita with his sword.  He shouted, "Look!  Rama's wife is dead! You lost!"

The monkeys were very sad.  They thought Sita was really dead.  They were scared and ran away.  Indrajit and Ravana were happy, thinking they'd won.  But it was all a trick!
