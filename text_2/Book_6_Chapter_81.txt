Guessing Rama's heart, wise and true,
Indrajit from the battle withdrew.
Into the city, he took his flight,
Reflecting on the demons' might.

Recalling victories he'd won before,
He sallied forth with anger's roar.
Born in Pulastya's lineage divine,
An adversary of gods, his prowess did shine.

From the western gate, he did emerge,
His intent and power, none could submerge.
He saw valiant Rama and Lakshmana stand,
Prepared for battle, sword in hand.

Then, with his conjuring tricks displayed,
An illusory Sita he portrayed.
Upon his chariot, an army vast,
His plan to confuse, to the last.

Monkeys, enraged, advanced to fight,
With rocks in hand, they took their flight.
Hanuman, leader of the brave,
Took a mountain peak to cross the wave.

In the chariot, he glimpsed a sight,
Sita, Rama's wife, in sorrow's plight.
Miserable, dusty, and deeply distressed,
Her appearance filled his heart with unrest.

Hanuman wondered what might transpire,
As he saw her, his eyes filled with fire.
He and the monkey leaders ran ahead,
To face Indrajit, with courage widespread.

But the demon, angry and full of hate,
With arrows, their advance did abate.
Seizing Sita by her hair so fair,
He drew his sword, the skies to scare.

Monkeys watched with tearful eyes,
As Indrajit committed his vilest of lies.
With Sita's image, he played a cruel game,
To deceive them all and tarnish her name.

Hanuman, valiant and wise,
With anger burning in his eyes,
Spoke harsh words to Indrajit's shame,
And condemned the demon for his claim.

"Evil-minded one," Hanuman cried,
"Your actions are wicked, nowhere to hide.
You touch Sita's hair, your own doom you bring,
Such cruelty and sin, no praise can sing.

Sita left her home, her kingdom, her kin,
What harm did she do, to suffer this sin?
By killing her, you'll face a dire fate,
In realms condemned by all, it's too late.

You'll fall to worlds where killers of women reside,
A fate worse than death, nowhere to hide.
Your life in this world, you will forsake,
For the crimes you commit, no pardon to take."

With these words of anger and disdain,
Hanuman and the monkeys rushed amain.
Demons' ranks with fury they did assail,
But Indrajit's arrows made them quail.

Indrajit spoke, "For whom you fight this day,
I'll kill Sita and show you the way.
Rama, Lakshmana, Sugriva, take heed,
Your fate is sealed, no escape, indeed.

Women should not be killed, you say,
But tormenting foes must be our way.
Torment I shall, and I shall win,
For in this battle, I'm born to sin."

To Hanuman's grief, Sita he slew,
With his sword so sharp and true.
She fell to the ground, her life undone,
As Indrajit's wicked victory was won.

He sat in his chariot, a triumphant sound,
Roaring in triumph, his victory unbound.
Monkeys, dejected, heard his cheer,
And fled in sorrow, filled with fear.
