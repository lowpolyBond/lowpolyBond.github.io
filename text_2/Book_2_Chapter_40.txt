Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana were very sad to leave their home.  They bowed to their father, King Dasaratha, and then went to say goodbye to Queen Kaushalya, Rama’s mother.  She was very sad too.

Lakshmana then bowed to Queen Kaushalya and hugged his mother, Queen Sumitra.  Sumitra cried. She told Lakshmana, “Rama was born to protect the world. You were born to help him. Always be with Rama, my son.  Be loyal to him, no matter what.”  She told him to think of Rama as his father, Sita as his mother, and the forest as their home.

Sumantra, the chariot driver, spoke to Rama.  “Prince Rama,” he said, “please get in the chariot. I will take you wherever you need to go. Your journey to the forest begins today.”

Sita, all dressed in beautiful jewels, climbed into the shining chariot. Rama and Lakshmana quickly joined her. King Dasaratha had given Sita special clothes and jewels, and the chariot was full of weapons and armor.  

Sumantra drove the chariot, and the horses ran very fast.  The whole city was upset! People cried and ran after the chariot.  They begged Sumantra to slow down so they could see Rama one last time. They praised Sita for following Rama and Lakshmana for being such a good brother.

King Dasaratha was heartbroken. He ran after the chariot, crying. He heard the women crying like elephants whose families had been taken away. He was so sad, he felt like the moon during an eclipse – dark and weak.

Rama wanted to leave quickly, so he told Sumantra, “Faster, faster!”  The people cried, “Wait, wait!” Sumantra didn't know what to do!  The people’s tears fell like rain, washing away the dust from the chariot wheels.

Rama saw his parents running barefoot after the chariot. He felt terrible. He told Sumantra, “Drive faster!”  He couldn’t bear to watch them suffer.  His mother, Kaushalya, ran after him, calling his name, Sita’s name, and Lakshmana's.  The King shouted, "Wait!"  It was very hard for Sumantra to decide what to do.

Rama told Sumantra, "If the King asks why you didn't stop, tell him you couldn't hear him over the noise of the chariot."  He knew that staying would only make things worse. Sumantra, realizing this, urged the horses on.

The King watched the chariot go, and his courtiers told him, "Friends who want to see each other again don't follow them for too long." The king, sweating and very sad, watched until the chariot disappeared.
