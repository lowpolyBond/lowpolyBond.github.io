Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana reached a pretty river.  It was their first night in exile.  Rama told Lakshmana, "Don't worry!  The forest is quiet.  Everyone back in Ayodhya, even my father the king, is sad we left.  But my brother Bharata will take care of them."  Rama felt bad for his parents, but he knew Bharata would help. He also said he was glad Lakshmana came with them to help protect Sita.  "Tonight, I'll only drink water," he said.

Rama then told their driver, Sumantra, "Take good care of the horses."  After sunset, Sumantra tied the horses to a tree and gave them fresh grass. He prayed, then helped Lakshmana make a bed of leaves for Rama, Sita, and himself.  They all slept by the river.

While Rama and Sita slept, Lakshmana talked to Sumantra about how wonderful Rama was.  They talked all night!

At sunrise, Rama woke up.  He saw Sumantra and the others sleeping under the trees.  "They followed us and gave up their homes," Rama said to Lakshmana.  "Let's leave quietly so they don't have to sleep outside too."

Lakshmana agreed.  Rama told Sumantra to get the chariot ready.  "Let's go to the forest," he said.

Sumantra quickly got the chariot ready. Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana climbed in.  They crossed the river. To hide their tracks, Rama told Sumantra to drive south, then back north, towards the forest.  Finally, they were heading towards Tapovana, a forest where they would live.
