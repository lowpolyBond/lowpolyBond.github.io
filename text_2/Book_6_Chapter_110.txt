Rama and Ravana fought!  Their chariots zoomed around, like race cars!  They shot so many arrows, it looked like rain!

They stopped, chariot to chariot.  Rama shot four arrows, and they knocked Ravana's horses back! Ravana got angry and shot back at Rama.  Rama was hurt, but he didn't give up!  Ravana even shot at Rama's driver, Matali, but Matali didn't fall!  Rama was mad that Ravana hurt his friend, so he shot tons and tons of arrows at Ravana!

Ravana threw giant clubs and maces! The ground shook! The ocean got angry! Even the sun got dimmer!  Everyone watched, worried.  The gods prayed, "Please let Rama win!"

The fight was amazing! People said, "It's like nothing we've ever seen!"  Rama shot an arrow, and *chop!* off went one of Ravana's heads! But another head grew right back!  Rama kept shooting. He chopped off head after head!  He shot and shot, but Ravana didn't fall.

Rama wondered, "My arrows beat everyone else, why not Ravana?" But he kept fighting!  Ravana kept throwing his clubs.  They fought and fought, up in the air, on the ground, even on mountains! They fought for seven whole days and nights, without stopping!

Rama's chariot driver, Matali, saw Rama was having a hard time.  He was about to say something...
