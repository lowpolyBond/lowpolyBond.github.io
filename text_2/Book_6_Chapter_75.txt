King Sugriva, the monkey king, had a great idea.  "Kumbhakarna is dead!" he shouted. "Ravana can't hurt us anymore!  Brave monkeys, attack Lanka! Use torches!"

Night fell.  The monkeys, carrying flaming torches, rushed towards Lanka.  They were so fast!  The giant guards ran away, scared. The monkeys set fire to everything!  Houses, gates, even huge palaces!  They burned beautiful things – gold, jewels, silks, and even elephant saddles!  Everything went up in flames!

Inside Lanka, the giants were partying. They were drunk and wearing fancy clothes.  They were asleep or eating.  Suddenly, the fire woke them up!  Scared, they ran, carrying their children.  Their beautiful houses crumbled around them. The fire lit up the sky, brighter than any mountain! It looked like a giant, fiery tree!  Loose elephants and horses ran wild, making the city look like a stormy sea.

The women screamed. Their cries echoed for miles.  The giants, their skin burning, ran out.  The monkeys jumped on them, ready to fight!  Monkeys and giants roared and fought – a huge, noisy battle!

Rama and Lakshmana, the brothers, were ready to fight too. Rama's bow made a scary sound! His arrows knocked down giant gates! The giants fought back, roaring like lions.

Sugriva shouted, "Monkeys, attack the city gates! Anyone who disobeys will be punished!"

The monkeys attacked!  Ravana, the evil king, was furious! He sent his best fighters – Kumbha and Nikumbha, and others.  They were big and strong, and their weapons shone brightly.

The monkeys and the giants fought with torches, swords, and spears. It was a dazzling, terrible battle. The battle was so bright, it lit up the whole sky and sea!

Monkeys threw rocks and trees. Giants swung swords.  It was a messy, noisy fight! Monkeys were hurt, and giants were hurt. They fought until they were tired!  The whole city burned. It looked like the end of the world.
