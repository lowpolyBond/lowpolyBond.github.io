Bharata, a prince with strong arms and kind eyes, heard a sad story.  He felt so heartbroken that he fainted, falling to the ground like a tired elephant.

His brother, Shatrughna, cried and hugged him.  Bharataâ€™s mothers, who were very sad because their father, the king, had died, surrounded him. Queen Kaushalya, Bharata's mother, held him close and asked, "My son, are you alright?  Our family needs you! Rama and Lakshmana are in the forest.  Our king is gone, and you must protect our people."

Bharata woke up. He comforted his mother and asked Guha, a king from a nearby land, "Where did my brother Rama sleep? What did he eat?"

Guha happily told Bharata about Rama's visit.  "I offered Rama lots of food," he said. "But Rama, being a kind warrior, refused to eat much. He said, 'It's our duty to give, not to take.'"

Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana slept on a bed of grass.  Lakshmana, with his bow and arrows, stayed awake all night, guarding them. Guha and his people also kept watch.  Guha showed Bharata the tree and the spot where Rama and Sita slept.
