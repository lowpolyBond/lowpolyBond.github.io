Once upon a time, Ila, a king, was changed into a woman!  Lakshmana and Bharata asked Rama, "What happened to Ila after she spent a year with the Moon God's son?"

Rama told them a story.  Ila became a man again!  But first, his clever friend Budha called some very wise and powerful holy men.

Budha said, "Let's help King Ila become a man again!"  Ila's father, Kardama, came with some other holy men. They all talked about how to help Ila.

Kardama, very wisely, said, "We need to perform a special sacrifice to the great god Rudra, who has a bull as his sign. This is a huge sacrifice called the Ashvamedha!"

Everyone agreed.  A holy man named Marutta did the amazing Ashvamedha sacrifice.  Rudra, the god, was very happy!

Rudra said, "I'm so happy with your sacrifice!  What can I do for King Ila?"  The wise men wished for Ila to be a man again.

Rudra made Ila a man once more! Then the god disappeared.  Everyone went home. King Ila built a beautiful new city called Pratishthana.  He lived there a long time, and then went to heaven. His son Pururavas became king.

Rama said, "The Ashvamedha sacrifice is so powerful! It brought Ila back to being a man.  There's no other way to do that!"
