Once upon a time, there was a big battle between the gods and the demons. It was dark and scary, but some heroes could still see.  Indra, the king of the gods, Ravana, the powerful demon king, and Meghanada, Ravana's son, were the bravest of them all.

Lots of gods and demons died in the fight.  Ravana got really angry when he saw his army losing. He roared, "Driver! Take me through the enemy! I'll defeat all the gods! I'll even defeat Indra himself!"

His driver zoomed through the battlefield. Indra, seeing Ravana’s plan, told the other gods, “Don't kill Ravana. Let's capture him! That's how I became king of the three worlds before!"

Indra fought bravely, but Ravana was strong and used magic.  He shot lots of arrows.  Ravana even hurt Indra's driver!

Indra got off his chariot and hopped on his elephant, Airavata, to chase Ravana. Ravana used magic to hide, then attacked Indra with more arrows. Indra was tired.  Ravana used more magic to catch Indra! He tied Indra up and took him prisoner.

The other gods were shocked. "What happened?  Who captured Indra?!" they cried. They attacked Ravana with tons of arrows, but he was still strong.

Then, Meghanada, who could also use magic, called to his father, "Father, we won! Indra is ours! Let's go home!"

Ravana heard his son's voice and agreed.  He told Meghanada to take Indra back to their city. Ravana and his army followed happily.  The gods were sad because their king was captured, but the demons had won this part of the battle.
