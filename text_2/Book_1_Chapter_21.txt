King Dasaratha wanted to keep his son Rama at home.  But a wise man, Vishvamitra, asked him to send Rama along.  

Dasaratha felt sad. He said, "But I promised to keep Rama safe!"

The wise man got angry! The ground shook!  Everyone was scared!

Another wise man, Vasishtha, calmed things down. He said to King Dasaratha, "You are a good king! You always keep your promises.  Don't break this one!"

Vasishtha explained that Vishvamitra was super strong and powerful! He had amazing weapons and magic! He could defeat any bad guy.  He needed Rama to help him, but Rama would be perfectly safe.  It was like trying to steal honey from a beehive guarded by a giant â€“ impossible!

Vasishtha said that Vishvamitra was so powerful, he even had weapons given to him by gods!  He knew everything and could make new weapons anytime. Rama would be safe with him.

King Dasaratha listened.  He understood.  He happily sent Rama with Vishvamitra.
