King Ravana was sad.  His giant brother, Kumbhakarna, laughed.  "Ravana," he said, "you made a mistake! You didn't listen to your good advisors.  You were too proud and didn't think about what could happen.  A king should always listen to his wise friends and helpers.  They help him decide what is right and wrong, and what to do and when.  They know how to be kind, how to fight, and how to make good plans.  They'll help you win!"

Kumbhakarna reminded Ravana of the good advice his wife, Mandodari, and brother, Vibhishana, had given him. "Do what's best," he said.

Ravana frowned. "I don't need your advice!" he grumbled. "Tell me what to *do* now!  If you're really my friend, show me your strength!"

Kumbhakarna calmed his angry brother. "Don't worry, Ravana! As long as I'm alive, nothing will happen to you. I will defeat Rama! I will kill Rama and his brother, Lakshmana! I will chase away the monkey army! You will see Rama’s head! Sita will be sad, and you will be happy! I will make all the Titans happy.  I will kill Sugriva, the monkey king! I'm strong enough to fight anyone – even the gods!  I don't need weapons; my fists are enough to defeat Rama! I will win this battle for you, I promise!"
