Hanuman, the mighty monkey king, told his friend Shatavali, "My friend, Rama's wife, Sita, is missing! We need to find her."

Hanuman explained, "Take one hundred thousand monkey helpers.  Search the far north, all the way to the snowy Himalaya mountains!"

"Rama has been so kind to us," Hanuman said. "Finding Sita is the best way to thank him. We must search everywhere!"

Hanuman listed many places to search:  "Look in the lands of the Mlecchas, Pulindas, and many other kingdoms! Check cities and mountains! Search caves and forests! Look near the Soma hermitage and Mount Kala. Check Mount Sudarshana and Mount Devasakha. Search everywhere, my friend!"

He described a long and difficult journey.  "You'll cross a big, empty desert.  Then you'll see the beautiful golden city of Kuvera,  but don't stop there! Keep searching in the mountains around his city."

Hanuman continued, "Go to Mount Krauncha,  a very hard mountain to climb! Look in all the caves!  Then go to Mount Mainaka – it's home to some strange horse-faced women! Keep searching!"

Hanuman told Shatavali about some wise, holy people to ask for help.  "Visit the Siddhas, very holy people. They might know where Sita is!"

He described even more amazing places:  "You'll see a river with amazing reeds. You’ll visit the Uttara Kurus, a land of beautiful rivers and trees that grow amazing fruits and jewels. It's like a magical land!"

Hanuman warned, "But don't go past the Uttara Kurus.  Beyond that is the Soma mountain. Even the gods can’t climb it!  It's too dangerous."

"Search every place I mentioned, Shatavali," Hanuman said. "Find Sita!  It will make Rama and me very happy! Then, you and your friends will be heroes!"
