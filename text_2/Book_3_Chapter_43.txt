Once upon a time, Sita, Rama, and Lakshmana lived in a forest. Sita was beautiful, like a shining sunbeam.  One day, while picking flowers, she saw a gorgeous deer! It sparkled like gold and silver.  "Rama! Lakshmana!" she cried. "Look at this beautiful deer!"

Rama and Lakshmana, who were strong warriors, came to see. Lakshmana was worried. "That's Marica, a wicked giant, pretending to be a deer!" he said.  "He tricks people into chasing him, then hurts them!"

But Sita loved the deer. "Please catch it for me, Rama," she begged. "It would be a wonderful pet! I've never seen anything so pretty!"  She described the deer's amazing colors and how it moved so gracefully.  She even said she wanted its skin to make a beautiful rug!

Rama, who loved Sita very much, agreed. "Alright," he said to Lakshmana. "I'll catch this deer for Sita.  You stay here and protect her."

Rama explained that even though this deer was magical, it was important to get it for Sita. He told Lakshmana stories about other bad giants who had been tricked like this.  He promised he would be back quickly.

"Stay here and guard Sita," Rama told Lakshmana. "Don't leave her side. I'll be back soon with the deer." Then Rama bravely went to chase the magical deer.  He didn't know what danger waited for him.
