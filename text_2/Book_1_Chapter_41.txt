King Sagara waited a long time for his sons to come back.  His grandson, Amshuman, was a brave and strong prince.  King Sagara told Amshuman, "Go find your uncles!  They went to find a magical horse.  The journey is dangerous! Take your sword, bow, and arrows. Be polite to everyone you meet, but fight anyone who tries to stop you."

Amshuman went on his journey.  He met lots of amazing creaturesâ€”friendly giants, magical birds, and even talking elephants! The elephants all told him to keep going.

Finally, Amshuman found where his uncles were.  They were just ashes!  He was very sad.  He wanted to give them water, but there was none.

Then, he saw his uncle, a giant eagle! The eagle said, "Don't be sad.  A powerful being named Kapila made them into ash.  You can't give them water the usual way.  Use water from the sacred Ganga River. That will send them to heaven."

Amshuman took the horse back to his grandfather. He told him everything the eagle said. King Sagara finished the ceremony.  He wanted to get water from the Ganga River, but he couldn't figure out how.  After ruling for a very, very long time, King Sagara died.
