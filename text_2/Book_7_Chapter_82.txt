Rama went to a beautiful lake to pray, just like the wise man told him.  After praying, he went back to the wise man's home.  The wise man made him a yummy dinner!  Rama ate and slept well.

In the morning, Rama said goodbye to the wise man.  He thanked him for being so kind.  Rama wanted to come back again soon.

The wise man smiled. He said, "Rama, you are so good! Just looking at you makes people happy and pure.  They go to heaven!  But anyone who is mean to you will be punished! You are a great leader, Rama.  Rule your kingdom fairly and kindly."

Rama bowed to the wise man and his friends.  Then he got into his flying chariot, the Pushpaka. It was shiny and golden!  It looked like the moon in the clouds.

The wise men wished Rama good luck.  He flew back to his city, Ayodhya. Everyone cheered when they saw him.  He got out of the chariot and said, "Pushpaka, go in peace!"

Then Rama told a guard, "Go tell Lakshmana and Bharata I'm home! Tell them to come see me right away!"
