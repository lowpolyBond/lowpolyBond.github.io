Once upon a time, a powerful king named Ravana was very bad.  He was mean and bossy.  A good king, Kubera, told his strong Yaksha warriors, "Go fight Ravana!"

Manibhadra, a brave Yaksha prince, led thousands of Yakshas into battle against Ravana's army of Rakshasas.  They fought with swords, spears, and clubs.  It was a huge, noisy battle!  Even the gods watched in amazement.  Many Yakshas and Rakshasas were hurt.

Manibhadra was very strong, but the Rakshasas were also powerful.  They used magic!  During the fight, a mean Rakshasa hit Manibhadra, and knocked his crown askew.  Poor Manibhadra had to run away.

Kubera got angry. He told Ravana, "You're very wicked!  You'll be punished!"  He even fought Ravana himself, but Ravana was clever.  He used magic to change shapes â€“ into a tiger, a boar, even a mountain!

Finally, Ravana hit Kubera so hard that Kubera fell down.  Ravana won that part of the battle.

Ravana was very happy.  He took Kubera's amazing flying chariot, the Pushpaka. This chariot was beautiful and could fly anywhere! Ravana felt very proud and even more mean. He thought he had conquered the whole world! He flew away in his amazing chariot, looking very proud of himself.
