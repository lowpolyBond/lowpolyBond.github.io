Long ago, in a land far away, lived a powerful king named Ravana.  He had a huge army, and one night they camped on a beautiful mountain.

The moon shone bright, and the mountain was covered with pretty flowers and sparkling pools.  Sweet music filled the air, from magical creatures called Kinneras and Vidyadharas. Ravana looked at all the beauty and felt very happy, but also very lonely.

Then, a beautiful nymph named Rambha walked by. She was going to a party.  She was wearing pretty clothes and flowers. Ravana was so amazed by her beauty that he stopped her.

He asked Rambha where she was going and begged her to stay. He said he was the king of everything and deserved her attention.

Rambha was scared! She explained that she was already promised to another, Nalakuvara, who was Ravanaâ€™s nephew. She said Ravana should protect her, not force himself on her.

But Ravana didn't listen. He was very powerful, and he took Rambha against her will.

Rambha was very sad and upset. She ran to Nalakuvara to tell him what happened.

Nalakuvara was furious! He was very angry at his uncle Ravana. He closed his eyes and said a powerful magic spell.  He cursed Ravana, saying that from now on, Ravana could only be with women who truly loved him. If he forced himself on anyone, his head would explode into seven pieces!

When Ravana heard about the curse, he was very scared.  He never forced anyone again.  Other women who had been taken by Ravana were very happy to hear the news.  The curse made them all safe.
