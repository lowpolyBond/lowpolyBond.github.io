King Dasaratha wanted a son, but he didn't have one.  Spring came, and the king decided to have a special ceremony, a big sacrifice, to ask the gods for a son.  He asked a wise holy man, Sage Rishyasringa, to help.

The king asked his friend Sumantra to get other wise men, called Brahmins, to come to the ceremony.  Sumantra brought them quickly. The king told the Brahmins, "I really want a son!  This sacrifice will help."

The Brahmins said, "Yes! You'll even get four sons, strong and brave!" The king was so happy!

He told his helpers, "Let's get everything ready! We need to let a horse go free, and build a special tent by the Sarayu River. We need to protect the ceremony so nothing goes wrong!"  He wanted everyone to be happy and safe.

The king's helpers were happy to help. They promised to do everything the king asked. The Brahmins went home. The king went to his room, feeling hopeful.
