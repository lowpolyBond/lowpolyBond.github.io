Once upon a time, the gods were very worried.  A powerful demon king named Ravana was being mean! He was hurting everyone.  They went to God Vishnu, who is very, very wise.

The gods asked Vishnu, "How can we stop Ravana?"

Vishnu said, "Ravana is very strong, but he's afraid of humans!  I will become a human to defeat him."

Vishnu decided to be born as the son of King Dasaratha.  King Dasaratha was doing a special prayer to have a son.

While the king was praying, a bright light appeared!  From the fire, a shining person walked out. He was tall and strong, like a lion, and carried a golden bowl of yummy sweet rice pudding called payasa.

The bright person said, "This payasa is a gift from the gods.  It will give you sons!"

King Dasaratha was so happy! He gave the payasa to his three queens: Kaushalya, Sumitra, and Kaikeyi.

Each queen ate some of the special pudding.  Soon, they all felt a baby growing inside!  They were going to have babies!

King Dasaratha was overjoyed. He knew that one of his sons would be the hero who would defeat the terrible Ravana.  And he was right!
