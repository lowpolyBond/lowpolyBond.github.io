Once upon a time, there was a shining gandharva (a heavenly being) named Gramani.  He had a beautiful daughter named Devavati, who was so pretty everyone knew her name.  Gramani gave Devavati to a strong man named Sukesha. Devavati was very happy.

Sukesha was a powerful man. He became even stronger, and he had three sons: Malyavan, Sumali, and Mali. They were super strong and brave, like three amazing heroes! They were so powerful, they were almost as strong as the gods themselves.

These three brothers wanted to be even stronger. They went to a tall mountain, Mount Meru, and did very, very hard exercises and prayers. They were so serious, everyone was scared!  Even the gods and goddesses were worried.

Then, Brahma, the creator god, came in his special chariot. He was amazed by their hard work.  The brothers asked Brahma for special powers. They asked to be invincible (unbeatable), to live long, to be very strong, and to always be friends. Brahma said, "So be it!"

The brothers were now super-duper strong and very proud! They were so powerful that they started to bother the gods and other heavenly beings.  They were very mean.

The brothers went to Vishvakarma, a great builder, and asked him to build them a wonderful palace. Vishvakarma said, "I will help! There is a great city called Lanka, on an island.  It is strong, beautiful and impossible to attack."

So the three brothers and their army went to Lanka. It was amazing!  It had golden walls and palaces. They lived happily there for a while.

Then, they married three beautiful gandharvi sisters. The brothers and their wives had many sons and daughters. These children also became very strong and mean, just like their fathers.  They started bothering the gods and other creatures even more! They were so mean, they even stopped people from praying!
