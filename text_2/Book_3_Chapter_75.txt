Rama and his brother Lakshmana were traveling. They had just visited a wise holy man's home.  It was a beautiful place, full of animals like deer and tigers, and all sorts of birds.  They felt peaceful.

Rama said to Lakshmana, "Let's go to Lake Pampa!  I heard that Sugriva, a powerful monkey king, lives near the Rishyamuka Mountain.  He might know where Sita is!"

Lakshmana said, "Let's go!"

They walked to Lake Pampa.  It was a magical place!  Lots of pretty flowers and birds were everywhere.  There were white cranes, peacocks, and woodpeckers. The water was clear and sparkling.  Beautiful trees surrounded the lake.  Many kinds of creatures lived there, like fish, turtles, and even magical beings!

Rama looked at the Rishyamuka Mountain.  "That's where Sugriva lives," he said.  He remembered what a giant had told him.  Then, Rama felt very sad. He missed Sita terribly.  He said, "Lakshmana, how can Sita live without me?"

Rama and Lakshmana went into the cool water of Lake Pampa. They were ready to find Sita.
