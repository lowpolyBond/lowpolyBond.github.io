A sad monkey told Sampati, a very old vulture, about Jatayu. Jatayu, Sampati's brother, had been killed by the mean Ravana. Sampati was too old and his wings were broken, so he couldn't help.

He told the monkeys a story.  Long ago, Sampati and Jatayu flew really high towards the sun! Jatayu got too close and felt very sick. Sampati protected him with his wings, but the sun burned his wings! He fell and landed on a mountain. He didn't know what happened to Jatayu after that.

The monkeys asked Sampati if he knew where Ravana lived.  Sampati, even though he was old and couldn't fly, knew a lot! He had seen Ravana steal a beautiful woman.  She cried out, "Rama! Rama!"  Sampati thought it was Sita.

Sampati told the monkeys that Ravana lived in Lanka, a city made of gold, far away across the ocean.  He described Lanka: it was very big and shiny, and Sita was kept inside, guarded by scary demons.

Sampati said he could see Lanka, even from where he was! He could see Sita because vultures can see really far.  He told the monkeys how to get there. They could follow different birds to find their way.

Then, the kind monkeys carried Sampati to the ocean. He wanted to do a special ceremony for his brother.  They helped him, then took him back to his mountain. The monkeys were happy! They knew how to find Sita!
