Once upon a time, there was a wise man named Vishvamitra. He wanted to become a great sage, so he prayed and did very hard things for a thousand years!  The gods were so impressed, they said, "Well done! You're a sage now!"

But Vishvamitra wanted to be even *better*. He prayed and did even harder things for many more years.  Then, a beautiful fairy named Menaka came to a nearby lake.  She was so pretty that Vishvamitra forgot all about his prayers! He spent ten years with her.

After ten years, Vishvamitra felt very ashamed. He realized the gods had tricked him!  He said, "Oh no! I wasted all that time!" He said goodbye to Menaka and went to the Himalayas, big tall mountains.

He started praying again, even harder than before! The gods got scared! They went to Brahma, the great god, and said, "He's too good!  Give him a special title!"

Brahma went to Vishvamitra and said, "You're a great sage!" But Vishvamitra said, "I still need to get better!"

So, Vishvamitra did even *more* hard things. He stood on one leg, ate only air, and even stood in fire!  He did this for another thousand years!

The gods were super worried!  This time, they asked a different fairy, Rambha, to try and distract him... but that's a story for another time!
