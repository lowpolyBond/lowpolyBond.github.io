Angada, a super-strong monkey, defeated many of the demon army!  This made Vajradamshtra, a powerful demon, very, very angry.

Vajradamshtra fired many arrows at the monkey army.  The monkeys, brave and strong, fought back with rocks and trees!  It was a huge battle!  Many monkeys and demons were hurt.  Some were even missing arms and legs.

Vajradamshtra saw his army losing. He was furious! He shot special arrows that could hit many monkeys at once.  The monkeys ran away, scared.

Angada saw his friends running.  He was angry too! He and Vajradamshtra fought a big, big fight. They hit each other with trees, rocks, and maces (like big hammers).  Angada got hurt, but he was tough!

Angada swung a giant rock, smashing Vajradamshtra's chariot!  Then he threw another giant rock.  Vajradamshtra was dizzy and bleeding.  They fought with their fists! They were both very tired and hurt.

Angada grabbed a shiny sword.  He swung it with all his might!  He cut off Vajradamshtra's head!

The other demons were terrified. They ran away back to Lanka.  The monkeys cheered for Angada! He was a hero! He was so strong and brave, just like a god!
