Once upon a time, after their father died, Rama and his brothers were very sad.  They spent the night feeling heartbroken.  The next morning, they prayed by the river.  They sat quietly, not saying a word.

Bharata, one of Rama's brothers, finally spoke. He said to Rama, "Brother, our father gave me the kingdom.  But my mother wants you to be king.  I can't rule without you.  You're like a strong horse, and I'm just a donkey!  Please, be king!" Bharata begged Rama to take the throne. Everyone cheered, shouting, "Well said!"

Rama was kind.  He saw how upset Bharata was. He said, "Bharata, everything changes. People are born, and people die.  It's like a fruit falling from a treeâ€”it's natural. Our father lived a long life. He was a good king. He did many kind things, helping everyone."

Rama explained, "Life is like a river; it keeps flowing. Time goes by. We all get old. Just as a building gets old and falls down, so do we. Don't be sad, Bharata.  Our father wanted you to be king, and he wanted me to live in the forest. We must follow his wishes."

Rama said their father was a great king who helped everyone. He built wells and did many good deeds. Now he's in a better place. Rama told Bharata to return to the city and rule. He said he would follow his father's wishes and stay in the forest.  

Rama's wise words made Bharata feel a little better.  Rama stayed quiet after that, but everyone knew he was a good and loving brother.
