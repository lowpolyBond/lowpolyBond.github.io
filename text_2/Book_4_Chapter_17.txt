Once upon a time, Rama, a brave prince, shot an arrow.  Bang!  A mighty monkey king, Bali, fell to the ground like a tree chopped down by a woodcutter.  Bali was covered in beautiful gold jewelry, but he was hurt and couldn't move.  He looked like a beautiful flag that had been broken.

When Bali fell, the world seemed to get dark, like the night sky without the moon.  Even though he was hurt, Bali was still handsome and strong.  A special golden necklace kept him alive and strong.  He looked like a pink cloud at sunset. The arrow, the necklace, and Bali's body shone brightly, even though he was lying down. Rama's arrow was magical; it opened the way for Bali to go to a better place.

Bali looked like a fire that had gone out, or a great king who had lost his power. He was huge and strong, with a golden necklace, big arms, and a fierce face. Rama and his brother, Lakshmana, walked slowly towards him, showing respect.

Bali, even though hurt, spoke to Rama.  "You hit me from behind!" he said. "That's not fair! I was fighting someone else."

Bali told Rama he had heard that Rama was good and kind, but he didn't act that way.  "You are like a hidden fire," Bali said.  "You look good on the outside, but you did something wrong."  Bali said he hadn’t done anything bad to Rama. He was just a monkey who lived in the forest, eating fruits and roots.  He asked Rama, "Why did you kill me?"

Bali reminded Rama that a king should be fair and just, not selfish and angry.  He said Rama was more interested in his own desires than in doing what was right. "You killed me for no reason!" Bali cried.  He also said that killing someone unfairly was a bad thing, and Rama would have to answer for this someday.  He even mentioned that he could have easily helped Rama get his wife back if Rama had just asked.

Bali talked about how he ignored good advice from his friend.  He was sad and felt Rama wasn't a good king.  He wondered how someone as great as Rama's father, King Dasaratha, could have a son who did such a thing.

Finally, Bali said, "You didn't fight me fairly. You attacked me when I wasn’t looking, like a snake biting a sleeping person." Bali was very upset, but then he became quiet.  Even though he was hurt, he spoke his mind bravely to Rama, before he finally closed his eyes.
