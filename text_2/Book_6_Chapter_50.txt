The monkey king, Sugriva, saw his army running scared.  "What's happening?" he asked.  "It looks like a ship in a storm!"

Angada, Bali's son, answered, "Don't you see Rama and Lakshmana?  They're hurt!  Covered in arrows and blood!"

Sugriva was puzzled.  "Something else is scaring the monkeys," he said. "They're dropping their weapons and running away!"

Just then, Bibhishana arrived, waving a big club and shouting, "Victory to Rama!"  Sugriva realized Bibhishana was the reason for the fear.  The monkeys thought he was Ravana's son!

Sugriva told Jambavan, the wise bear king, "Tell the monkeys it's Bibhishana!  He's on our side!"

Jambavan calmed the monkeys.  They stopped running and went back.

Bibhishana saw Rama and Lakshmana.  He was very sad.  He washed their faces and cried.  "Ravana's tricks have hurt them," he sobbed. "My brother is evil! Rama and Lakshmana, my hope for being king, are hurt!  I feel like I'm dead!"

Sugriva hugged Bibhishana. "Don't worry," he said. "You will be king! Rama and Lakshmana will be okay. They'll defeat Ravana!"

Sugriva told Sushena, his stepfather, "Take Rama and Lakshmana to Kishkindha to heal. I'll defeat Ravana and bring Sita back!"

Sushena knew how to help.  "Gods and demons once fought a great battle," he said. "Even when the gods were badly hurt, they were healed with special herbs from the mountains near the Milky Ocean. Hanuman, the strong monkey, must go get them!"

Suddenly, a huge wind blew!  The sea was rough.  Then Garuda, a powerful bird, arrived. He saw the arrows holding Rama and Lakshmana.  He scared away the snakes in the arrows, then healed Rama and Lakshmana.

Rama thanked Garuda.  "Who are you?" he asked.

Garuda said, "I am your friend!  Only I could break those magic arrows!"  He warned Rama, "Ravana is tricky.  Always be brave and honest!"

Garuda flew away.  The monkeys were happy!  They cheered and got ready to fight!  The battle was about to begin!
