Once upon a time, King Janaka finished a big ceremony. He wanted to invite his younger brother, King Kushadvaja, to a very important wedding.  King Kushadvaja lived in a beautiful city, Sankamshya, with a river nearby and strong walls.

King Janaka sent fast horses to bring his brother.  The messengers were very quick, like gods on a mission!  King Kushadvaja happily agreed to come. He bowed to King Janaka and his friend, Shatananda.

Then, the two brothers decided to invite another king, King Dasaratha. They asked their wise advisor, Sudamana, to go invite him. Sudamana raced to King Dasaratha’s camp and gave him the invitation.

King Dasaratha, with his family and friends, went to meet King Janaka. King Dasaratha said, "My wise priest, Vasishtha, will tell you about our family history."

Vasishtha started a long story: "A very, very long time ago, there was Brahman. From Brahman came many, many kings.  First came Ikswaku, the very first king of Ayodhya! Then came many more kings: Kukshi, Vikukshi, Vana, Anranya, Prithu, Trishanku, Dhundhumara, Yuvanashva, Mandhata, Susandhi, Dhruvasandhi, Bharata, Asit… and many, many more!  There was even a king born with poison!"

Vasishtha told a long, long story about all the kings that came before King Dasaratha. Finally, he said, "And King Dasaratha has two wonderful sons, Rama and Lakshmana.  He would love for them to marry your daughters!"
