Once upon a time, in a faraway kingdom, lived King Dasaratha. He had four sons: Rama, Bharata, Lakshmana, and Shatrughna.  Bharata and Shatrughna went to visit their uncle. They had a wonderful time!

King Dasaratha loved all his sons, but Rama was his favorite. Rama was very brave, kind, and smart. He was also very handsome!  Rama was so good, it was like a god had come to Earth to help people. His mother, Queen Kaushalya, loved him very much.

Rama was the best! He was always kind, even to those who were mean to him. He helped everyone, and he was a great student. He was strong and brave, like a hero in stories. He knew so much, and people loved him very, very much. He was even better at fighting than his father! Everyone loved him like family.

King Dasaratha was getting old. He wanted Rama to be king, so he could rule after him.  He thought, "Rama is the best person to rule! He is kind, brave, and wise."

The king decided to make Rama the new king. He invited all the important people to a big party.  He wanted everyone to celebrate Rama becoming the next king.  He was so happy to see his son finally get the honor he deserved.  But things were about to changeâ€¦
