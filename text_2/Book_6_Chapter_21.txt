Rama wanted to cross the ocean.  He was going to Lanka to save his wife, Sita. First, he politely bowed to the ocean. He lay down on the grass, tired from his journey.  His strong arms, usually smelling sweet with flowers, were scratched from using his powerful bow.

He waited.  He waited and waited.  But the ocean didn't help him.  Rama got angry!  He thought the ocean was ignoring him.

"The ocean is being rude!" Rama shouted. "I'll make it move! I'll dry it up with my arrows!"

Rama grabbed his giant bow and arrows.  He was ready to fight!  He aimed his arrows, and the ocean started to shake! Big waves crashed!  Fish and snakes were scared! The ground trembled!

Just then, Lakshmana, Rama's brother, stopped him.  "Brother," he said, "Don't be angry!  You don't need to fight the ocean."

Hidden wise men in the sky also cried out, "Stop! Stop!"  Rama listened to his brother and the wise men.  He calmed down.  He didn't need to fight. The ocean was about to help him anyway.
