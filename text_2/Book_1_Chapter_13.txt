Once upon a time, King Dasaratha wanted a son.  He decided to hold a big, important ceremony to ask the gods for a baby.  Spring had arrived, making everything beautiful.

He went to his wise teacher, Sage Vasishtha, and asked for help.  "Wise teacher," said the king, "please help me with this special ceremony.  I need your wisdom!"  The sage smiled and said, "Of course, my king, I will help."

Sage Vasishtha told everyone what to do.  He needed lots of helpers!  He called for builders to make many houses for all the guests.  He needed cooks to prepare yummy food.  He even needed entertainers like dancers and actors! He told them to be kind and welcoming to everyone, rich or poor.

Then, he told Sumantra, the king's helper, to send invitations. "Invite all the kings and important people!" he said.  "Especially invite King Janaka from Mithila, he's a good friend of our king!"  Sumantra set off to invite all the important guests.

The builders worked hard. They made beautiful houses and filled them with food. Sumantra brought many kings, all with amazing gifts.

Finally, everything was ready!  Sage Vasishtha told King Dasaratha, "Your ceremony is prepared, Your Majesty! Come and see!" The king was happy. He and his wives went to the special place.

A very holy man named Rishyasringa was chosen to lead the ceremony.  Then, the big ceremony began! The king and his queens joined in. The ceremony was exactly as it should be, many years ago.
