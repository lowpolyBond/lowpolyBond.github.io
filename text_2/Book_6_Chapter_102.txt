Rama's brother Lakshmana was hurt really badly!  A big, mean giant named Ravana had thrown a spear at him.  Lakshmana was lying on the ground, bleeding.

Rama was heartbroken.  He loved Lakshmana more than anything.  He felt so sad and weak, he almost couldn't fight anymore.  He cried, "Without Lakshmana, what's the point of anything? I want to die too!"

A wise monkey doctor named Sushena saw Rama's sadness.  He said, "Don't worry, Rama! Lakshmana isn't dead!  His heart is still beating!"

Sushena told a very strong monkey named Hanuman, "Go to Mahodaya Mountain! There are special magic plants that can heal Lakshmana!"

Hanuman was super strong, but he couldn't find the plants.  So, he did something amazing! He ripped off the whole top of the mountain!  He carried it back,  "Here's the whole mountaintop! Maybe the plants are here!"

Sushena found the magic plants, crushed them, and held them to Lakshmana's nose.  POOF! Lakshmana woke up!  Everyone cheered!

Rama hugged Lakshmana so tight! He was so happy his brother was alive.  But Lakshmana said, "Rama, don't be sad! We need to defeat Ravana and save Sita!"

Lakshmana told Rama to be brave and finish the fight.  Rama promised he would defeat Ravana that very day.  And he did!
