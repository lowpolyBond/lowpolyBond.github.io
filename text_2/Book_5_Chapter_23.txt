King Ravana, a very powerful and scary demon king, told his mean wives to watch Sita.  He then went away.

His wives, who looked really scary, rushed to Sita. They were very angry.

“You should be happy to be with King Ravana!” they shouted.  "He’s super important and powerful! He's the son of a very, very important god!"

One of the wives, Ekjata, yelled, "Ravana is a super strong warrior!  His dad was also a really important god!  Why don't you want to be his wife?"

Another wife, Harijata, growled, "Ravana is so strong, he even beat all the gods in a fight!  He's brave and never runs away. He even left his favorite wife for you!  He has a beautiful palace with tons of jewels and many, many wives. You’ll be lucky to be his wife!"

Another wife, Vikata, added, "He's won many battles against other powerful beings.  Why don't you want such a powerful king?"

Finally, Durmukhi said, "Everyone is afraid of Ravana! Even the sun and wind obey him!  He makes trees bloom and hills pour with rain just by wishing it!  Be his wife, or you will be in big trouble!"

They all told Sita that she had better agree to be Ravana's wife, or bad things would happen to her.
