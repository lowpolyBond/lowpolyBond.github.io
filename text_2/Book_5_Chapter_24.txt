Once upon a time, mean and ugly giantesses surrounded Sita.  They were very angry! They yelled at her, "Why don't you live in Ravana's beautiful palace?  Forget Rama! You'll never see him again.  Ravana is powerful and rich! He's the king of the giants! Be his wife!"

Sita, her eyes full of tears, said, "That's wrong! I will never be the wife of a demon! I will always be with Rama, my husband.  He may be poor, but he's my teacher and my love.  Just like other good wives are with their husbands, I will be with him."

The giantesses got even angrier.  They shouted more mean things at Sita.  A little monkey, Hanuman, was hiding nearby in a tree. He heard everything.

The giantesses surrounded Sita, pointing spears at her. They said, "Don't you think Ravana is good enough for you?"

Sita was scared. She sat under a tree, crying. The giantesses kept yelling at her.  One giantess, Vinata, said, "Sita, be smart! Ravana is strong and kind. Leave Rama and be Ravana's queen!"

Another giantess, Vikata, said, "You're so young, Sita!  Don't waste your youth! Be happy with Ravana!  Or, I will hurt you!"

Another giantess, Chandari, said, "I want to eat Sita!"

Praghasa shouted, "Let's just kill her!"

Ajamukhi said, "Let's share her!"

And Shurpanakha agreed, "Let's have a party and eat Sita!"

Sita was so sad and scared she cried even more.  The giantesses were terrible! Hanuman, the monkey, watched everything. He knew he had to help Sita.
