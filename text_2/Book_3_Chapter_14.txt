Rama and his brother Lakshmana were walking to Pancavati.  They saw a huge vulture!  It was so big and strong, they thought it might be a demon in disguise.  "Who are you?" they asked.

The vulture spoke in a friendly voice. "I'm a friend of your father!" he said.

Rama was happy to hear this. He bowed to the vulture and asked its name and family.

The vulture told a long story:  "Long ago, there were powerful beings called Prajapatis.  They had many children!  One, Kashyapa, married eight sisters.  He told them, 'Have children who will rule the world!'"

Some of the sisters did.  One had children who became gods. Another had children who became powerful giants.  Other sisters had children who became birds like owls, vultures, hawks, and swans!  Some had children who were deer, bears, monkeys, tigers, elephants, cows, horses, and snakes!  Even people came from one of Kashyapaâ€™s wives!  And from another came all the trees with yummy fruit!

The vulture said, "I'm Jatayu! My family are vultures.  My great-grandmother was Shuni! My father was Aruna."

Jatayu said, "If you want, I'll stay near you and protect Sita while you're away."

Rama was very happy. He knew his father was friends with Jatayu's family.  He hugged Jatayu and thanked him.  Then Rama, Lakshmana, and Jatayu went to Pancavati together. Rama promised to defeat his enemies and to always pray.
