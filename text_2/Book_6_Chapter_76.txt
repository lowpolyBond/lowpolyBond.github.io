Once upon a time, during a big battle, a brave monkey named Angada fought a strong warrior named Kampana.  Kampana hit Angada hard, but Angada got back up and threw a rock, knocking Kampana down!

Then, another warrior, Shonitaksha, attacked Angada with fiery arrows.  Angada was hurt, but he was so strong he broke Shonitaksha's bow and chariot!  He even broke Shonitaksha's sword with his bare hand!  Angada then fought many other warriors.

Two warriors, Yupaksha and Prajangha, fought Angada too.  They were very strong, and Angada looked like the moon between two bright stars!  Angada's monkey friends, Mainda and Dvivida, helped him fight.  They threw trees and rocks, but Prajangha broke them with his sword.

Prajangha hit Angada hard with a tree, then his fist.  But Angada, super strong, knocked Prajangha's head right off!

When Yupaksha saw his uncle fall, he rushed to help. Dvivida grabbed him, but Shonitaksha hit Dvivida. Mainda then joined the fight, and soon both Yupaksha and Shonitaksha were defeated!

The other warriors got scared and ran away, except for a super strong warrior named Kumbha.  He shot lots of arrows at the monkeys.  He hit Dvivida and then Mainda, who both fell down.

Kumbha shot many arrows at Angada too.  Angada was hurt but kept fighting!  Kumbha even shot off Angada's eyelids!  But Angada pulled up a big tree and threw it at Kumbha!

Angada finally fell, and his friends told Rama, the king, what happened.  Rama sent more monkeys to help.  Jambavan, Sushena, and Vegadarshin fought Kumbha, but Kumbha shot so many arrows, they couldnâ€™t get close!

Sugriva, the monkey king, protected Angada and threw huge trees at Kumbha.  Kumbha broke the trees with his arrows.  Then, Sugriva broke Kumbha's bow!

Sugriva gave Kumbha a big speech, telling him how strong he was. Then, they wrestled! Sugriva threw Kumbha into the ocean, but Kumbha came back! They wrestled again, and Sugriva knocked Kumbha out with a super-strong punch!

When the mighty Kumbha fell, everyone was amazed. The other warriors were so scared, they ran away!  The monkeys had won the battle!
