In battle fierce, Angada takes the lead,
Kampana falls, a mountain at his speed,
Struck by mace, Angada reels, not swayed,
But soon he strikes back, victory displayed.
With consciousness regained, Angada strong,
Hurls a mountain, sends Kampana wrong,
The demon falls, defeated by the thrust,
In battle's fury, crumbles into dust.
Shonitaksha, fearless, rushes to the fray,
Sharp arrows, fiery darts, he does convey,
With names like Kshura, Vipatha, they sting,
Angada's limbs, to destruction they bring.
Undaunted, Angada, Vali's noble son,
Crushes bow, chariot, darts, the battle won,
Shonitaksha, undeterred, takes up the sword,
Angada's power, his strikes can't afford.
Sword meets shoulder, Angada stands tall,
Cuts Shonitaksha, proud demon does fall,
Diagonal strike, a fatal blow dealt,
Victory to Angada, in battle he's swelled.
Yupaksha, tears in his eyes, seeks the fray,
Dvivida confronts, in fierce melee,
Dvivida strikes, Yupaksha can't defend,
Mainda joins the fight, marks the battle's end.

Three monkey chiefs, against the demon tide,
In battle fierce, they do not hide,
Rocks and trees they hurl with all their might,
But demons resist, in this perilous fight.
Demons wield swords, arrows, maces swing,
Monkeys stand strong, in defiance they cling,
A clash of titans, battle fierce and grand,
In this epic struggle, where warriors stand.
Dvivida and Mainda, with valor untold,
Battle Shonitaksha, their spirits bold,
With strength and skill, they strive to conquer,
But demons fight back, like a powerful anchor.
Prajangha, with mace, joins the fray,
Angada, the target, stands in their way,
Between these warriors, he shines so bright,
Like the moon between stars, a radiant light.
But Angada prevails, his fist strikes true,
Prajangha's head severed, his life is through,
Yupaksha, in sorrow, takes up the fight,
Dvivida and Mainda, their hearts ignite.

Yupaksha falls, defeated in the brawl,
Monkeys stand tall, demons start to fall,
But Kumbha, a demon of immense might,
Challenges Angada in the deadly fight.
Arrows fly, Kumbha's bow is strong,
Angada persists, the battle goes on,
Rocks and trees are hurled, a fierce display,
But Kumbha's skill keeps them at bay.
Kumbha strikes Angada, bloodied and torn,
But the monkey stands firm, not forlorn,
He wields a tree, a formidable spear,
In this battle of giants, they show no fear.
Sugriva, with thunderbolt-like fist,
Joins the fight, in Kumbha's path he exists,
He strikes a blow, Kumbha's armour breaks,
Blood flows from his chest, the ground it lakes.
Kumbha retaliates, a mighty punch,
But Sugriva's bones, a solid crunch,
Fist meets fist, a clash of strength and might,
In this epic battle, a breathtaking sight.
Sugriva's blow, like a lightning blaze,
Sends Kumbha falling, lost in a daze,
The earth trembles, mountains quake in fear,
Demons shudder, as victory draws near.
