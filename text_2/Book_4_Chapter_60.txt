After the vulture Sampati prayed for his brother, the monkey leaders sat around him on a big, amazing mountain.  Sampati wanted to help, so he told the monkeys a story.

"Listen closely!" he said.  "A long time ago, I crashed on a tall mountain called Vindhya. The sun was so hot, it burned my wings!  I was hurt and weak for six days.  When I finally felt better, I looked around.  I knew this place – it was the Vindhya mountain near the ocean.

There was a holy place where a very good saint lived. His name was Nishakara.  I spent eight thousand years on that mountain!  I was very old and hurt.  I crawled down very slowly to see him.  Jatayu, my brother, and I used to visit the saint often.

The mountain was beautiful.  Lots of flowers and fruits grew everywhere. I waited for the saint.  I saw him from far away, shining brightly.  He was surrounded by animals, like bears and tigers, who all went away when he went inside.

The saint was happy to see me. He looked at my burned wings. ‘You’re Sampati!’ he said.  ‘Your brother is Jatayu, right? You both used to visit me.’ He asked what happened to me.  I'll tell you soon!"
