Night fell, and Shatrughna asked a wise man named Cyavana about Lavana, a powerful demon.  "How strong is Lavana's weapon?" he asked. "Who did he defeat with it?"

Cyavana said, "Lavana is very, very strong!  Long ago, a great king named Mandhata ruled Ayodhya.  He was so strong he wanted to rule the heavens too!  The king of the gods, Indra, was scared.

Indra told Mandhata, "You haven't conquered all the earth yet! Do that first, then you can think about ruling the heavens."

Mandhata asked, "Who hasn't obeyed me?"

Indra said, "Lavana, a demon, hasn't. He lives in the forest."

Mandhata felt ashamed. He went to fight Lavana.  He sent a messenger first, but Lavana ate the messenger!

Angry, Mandhata attacked Lavana with many arrows.  Lavana threw his magic trident.  *Whoosh!*  The trident burned Mandhata, his army, and everything to ashes!

That trident is incredibly powerful," Cyavana said. "But don't worry, Shatrughna!  Tomorrow, Lavana will go hunting without his trident. You will easily defeat him.  You will win, and everyone will be safe!"
