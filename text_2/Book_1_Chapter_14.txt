King Dasaratha wanted a son.  He held a big, important ceremony called a sacrifice.  It lasted a whole year!  A special horse went far away and came back.

Many, many priests helped.  They were very smart and knew lots of special prayers. They made sure everything was done perfectly.  There was lots and lots of food!  Everyone ate their fill â€“ even the old people and the children.  The king gave away lots of clothes, money, and presents.

The priests built beautiful tall pillars for the ceremony. They were shiny gold and decorated with flowers!  They also built special places for the fire.  They even sacrificed animals, like birds and horses, to the gods. Queen Kaushalya helped with the sacrifice.

After the big ceremony, the priests gave the kingdom back to the king!  They said they were too busy studying to rule.  The king gave them tons of gold and silver instead. He also gave gifts to everyone else.  He even gave his special bracelet to a poor man!

King Dasaratha was very happy.  He asked a wise priest, Rishyasringa, how he could have a son.  Rishyasringa smiled and said, "You will have four sons, King!"  And that's how the story begins!
