Once upon a time, Queen Kaikeyi was very angry.  She whispered to her friend Manthara, "I want Rama to leave, and I want Bharata to be king!"

Manthara was a sneaky friend. She wanted Rama to be gone.  "I know how," she said.  "Remember the time your husband, King Dasaratha, fought a big battle? He promised you two wishes!"

Queen Kaikeyi remembered!  She asked Manthara, "How can I use those wishes to make Bharata king and send Rama away?"

"Easy!" Manthara said. "Use your first wish to make Bharata the king. Use your second wish to send Rama away for fourteen years!"

Manthara gave Kaikeyi a plan. "Go to the king's angry room. Cry a lot! Don't talk, just cry.  Kings always feel sorry for their queens when they cry."

Kaikeyi did just that. She went to the angry room, cried, and reminded the king of his old promise.  She demanded that Bharata become king and Rama be sent away.

King Dasaratha loved Kaikeyi very much. He didn't want her to be sad. He agreed to her wishes, even though it broke his heart.  He loved Rama very much, too.

Manthara was very happy. She had tricked the king and made Queen Kaikeyi do something sad.  She promised Kaikeyi lots of gifts if her plan worked.


Because of Mantharaâ€™s bad advice, Rama was sent away from his home for fourteen years, and Bharata was made the king instead.  This made many people very sad.
