Lakshmana, Rama's brave brother, woke up near a river. He walked all day.  At noon, he reached their home, Ayodhya. It was a busy, happy city.  But Lakshmana felt worried. He wondered what to say to Rama.

He saw Rama's beautiful house, shining like the moon.  Lakshmana went inside, feeling sad.  He found Rama sitting on his throne, looking very upset. Lakshmana's eyes filled with tears. He bowed down to Rama and spoke softly.

"I did as you asked," Lakshmana said.  "I took Sita to the river Ganges, near a wise man's home. I left her there and came back. Don't be so sad, Rama.  It was meant to happen.  Even the best things end.  People grow old, they get sick, and sometimes people have to say goodbye. We should be brave even when things are hard."

Rama listened to his brother. Lakshmana was so kind and strong.

Rama smiled a little. "You're right, Lakshmana," he said. "Thank you. Your words make me feel better."  He felt much better hearing Lakshmana's wise words.  He knew his brother was right, and he would be brave.
