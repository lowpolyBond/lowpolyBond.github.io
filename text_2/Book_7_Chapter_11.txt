Once upon a time, a scary giant named Sumali heard that his grandson, Dashagriva, got some amazing magic powers.  Sumali wasn't scared anymore! He and his friends rushed out to see Dashagriva.

They hugged Dashagriva and said, "You got super powers! We were so scared, we hid underground!  Your brother, Ravana, took over our city, Lanka! Please get it back!"

Dashagriva said, "Ravana is my older brother. I can't do that."

Sumali knew Dashagriva was thinking about fighting, so he didn't say anything more.

Later, Dashagriva's friend Prahasta said, "Dashagriva, being nice to your brother isn't very heroic! Gods and giants have fought each other before. You should fight for Lanka!"

Dashagriva smiled. "You're right!" He sent Prahasta to talk to Ravana.

Prahasta went to Ravana and said, "Dashagriva wants Lanka back. It belongs to the giants!"

Ravana said, "Lanka was given to me. But Dashagriva, you can share it with me!"

Ravana told his dad, "Dashagriva wants Lanka! What should I do?"

His dad, Vishravas, said, "Dashagriva is very naughty. He's got magic powers that make him bad.  Leave Lanka and go to Mount Kailasha. It's a beautiful place!"

Ravana listened to his dad. He took his family and all his things and moved to Mount Kailasha.

Prahasta told Dashagriva, "Ravana left Lanka! You can take it!"

Dashagriva and his army marched into Lanka.  They were so happy!  Dashagriva became the king.

Ravana built a new, amazing city on Mount Kailasha.  It was just as beautiful as any other city in the land.
