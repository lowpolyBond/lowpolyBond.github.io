Princess Sita loved Rama very much.  Rama told Sita she should stay in the palace.  Sita said, "No, Rama! That's silly! A wife always goes where her husband goes.  I'm part of you!  I want to go with you to the forest!"

Sita explained that a wife's happiness comes from her husband.  "Even after I die," she said, "only my husband matters.  I'll walk ahead of you in the forest, clearing away thorny bushes and tall grass!  Please, Rama, don't leave me behind!"

Sita said she didn't care about palaces or magic powers.  All she wanted was to be with Rama.  "I learned how to be a good wife from my father," she said. "And being with you in the forest will be better than living in a palace!"

She promised to eat fruits and roots and would not be a burden. She wanted to see the pretty lakes and mountains with him, watch the birds, and bathe in the water.  "A thousand years with you would be better than living in heaven without you!" she cried.  "I want to see the deer and monkeys and elephants with you, Rama.  I'll be happy to serve you, even in the forest. Being away from you would make me very sad.  Please, take me with you!"

Rama was sad.  He loved Sita dearly, but he didn't want her to go through the hard life of the forest. He tried to explain how difficult it would be.
