King Ravana's advisors were a bunch of powerful giants. They thought they were super strong and told Ravana, "Don't worry, King! We have a huge army with swords, spears, and everything!  You've beaten everyone before! Remember when you fought the snake people?  Or when you defeated the giant Dhanada on Mount Kailasha?  You even conquered the scary underwater world! You're the strongest!"

They boasted about all of Ravana's past victories.  They talked about how he beat other giants and even powerful sea creatures. They said he was unbeatable.

"And King Ravana," they continued, "your son, Indrajita, is even more powerful! He got a magical gift from a powerful god. He's so strong, he can defeat Rama's monkey army all by himself!  Rama isn't a match for you!"

The giants told Ravana not to worry about Rama at all. They convinced him that his son Indrajita was strong enough to defeat Rama easily.  They said that fighting Rama himself wasn't necessary; Indrajita could handle it.  They all thought that Rama was weak compared to Ravana and his powerful army.
