Rama was very tired from fighting Ravana. He stood thinking on the battlefield.  Ravana was getting ready to fight again.  Then, a wise and holy man named Agastya came to Rama.

Agastya said, "Rama, listen! I will give you a secret to win! It's a special prayer to the Sun God!  This prayer is very powerful. It will help you defeat your enemies and bring you victory!"

Agastya taught Rama a prayer.  It went something like this: "Oh Sun God, you are bright and powerful! You are the creator, the protector, and the one who brings change. You give life to everything. You are strong and beautiful.  We thank you!"

Agastya said, "Rama, if you say this prayer three times, you will be very strong and brave! You will defeat Ravana!"  Then Agastya went away.

Rama felt much better. He thought about the Sun God, said the prayer three times, and felt strong and happy.  He cleaned his mouth and picked up his bow and arrow.

He saw Ravana and smiled. He felt ready to fight!  Even the Sun God was watching and said, "Rama, give it your all!"  Rama was ready to defeat Ravana!
