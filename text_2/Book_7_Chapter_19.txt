Ravana, the ten-headed king of the demons, was very strong. He went to other kings and said, "Fight me, or give up!"  These kings were brave, but Ravana was too powerful. They said, "We surrender!"

Then Ravana went to King Anaranya of Ayodhya.  He was a strong and brave king, too! Ravana challenged him to a fight.

King Anaranya said, "I accept your challenge!"  He had a huge army: ten thousand elephants, a million horses, thousands of chariots, and so many soldiers they covered the whole land!

The battle was HUGE!  King Anaranya and his army fought bravely, but Ravana's army was even stronger.  Soon, most of King Anaranya's army was gone, like moths flying into a fire.

King Anaranya was angry! He shot hundreds of arrows at Ravana, but Ravana wasn't hurt!  Ravana was so strong he knocked King Anaranya off his chariot.

Ravana laughed. He said, "No one can beat me!  You're lucky you even got to fight me!"

King Anaranya, though hurt, said, "It wasn't you who beat me, it was fate. But I curse you! A great warrior named Rama will be born, and he will defeat you!"

As he said this, beautiful flowers rained from the sky!  King Anaranya went to heaven. Ravana went away, but he didn't know that King Anaranya's curse would come true.
