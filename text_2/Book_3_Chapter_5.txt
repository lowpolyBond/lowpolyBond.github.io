Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana were walking in a scary forest.  They had just defeated a big, mean monster! Rama hugged Sita to make her feel better.  "This forest is dangerous," Rama said to Lakshmana. "Let's go see a wise old man named Sharabhanga."

They walked to Sharabhanga's home.  Suddenly, Rama saw something amazing!  High in the sky, a shiny chariot flew.  It was Indra, the king of the gods!  Indra was all sparkly and bright, like the sun.  Beautiful horses pulled his chariot.  Angels and other important people flew around him.

Rama pointed to the chariot. "Lakshmana, look!" he said. "Those are Indra's horses!  They're amazing!"  Indra looked like a strong warrior with his soldiers around him.

Indra was talking to Sharabhanga.  When he saw Rama, Indra quickly went away, saying he would meet Rama later after he finished his important job.

Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana went to Sharabhanga.  They bowed down to him.  Sharabhanga told them that Indra had wanted to take him to a special place in the sky.  But Sharabhanga wanted to meet Rama first!

Sharabhanga said, "Rama, there's another wise man named Sutikshna who can help you.  Follow the pretty Mandakini River, and you'll find him."

Then, Sharabhanga did something amazing. He made a fire and stepped into it!  The fire burned away his old body.  He came out looking young and strong!  He went up to the sky to live with the gods.

Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana knew they had to follow the river to find Sutikshna.  Their adventure continued!
