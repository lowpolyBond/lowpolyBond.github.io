Rama was amazed by Agastya's story.  He asked, "How did the mean Rakshasas live in Lanka a long, long time ago?"

Agastya smiled. He said, "Long ago, the world was created.  Many creatures were made, and they were hungry and thirsty.  They asked the Creator, ‘What should we do?’

"The Creator said, ‘Protect the waters!’ Some said, ‘We will protect!’  These became the Rakshasas. Others said, ‘We will worship!’ They became the Yakshas.

"Two brothers, Heti and Praheti, were Rakshasas. Praheti was good and went to live quietly. But Heti was mean.  He married a scary woman named Bhaya. They had a son named Vidyutkesha.

Vidyutkesha was strong and handsome. He married the beautiful daughter of Sandhya.  His wife, Salatantaka, had a baby on Mount Mandara.  She left the baby to go back to Vidyutkesha.

The little baby cried.  Lord Shiva and his wife, Parvati, heard him. They felt sorry for the baby and made him grow up instantly!  They gave him a flying chariot. Parvati also gave the Rakshasas a special gift: they could have babies that grew up right away!

Sukesha, that’s what the baby was called now, was very proud. He flew around everywhere in his amazing chariot."
