King Vishvamitra, a very strong and important king, visited a wise holy man named Vasishtha. He was so happy to see Vasishtha's home, a peaceful hermitage, that he bowed down respectfully.

Vasishtha welcomed the king and gave him some yummy fruits and roots to eat.  The king asked Vasishtha if everything was alright at his hermitage. Vasishtha said yes, even the trees were doing well!

Then Vasishtha asked the king, "King Vishvamitra, are you happy? Are your people happy? Is your kingdom doing well? Do you have enough food? Are your soldiers strong and brave?"

King Vishvamitra said, "Yes, everything is fine, thank you!"

They chatted for a long time, sharing stories.  Then Vasishtha smiled and said, "King, please let me be your host!  I want to give you and your soldiers a big feast!"

King Vishvamitra was very grateful but said, "Your kind words are enough.  I've already eaten your delicious fruits. Just meeting you is an honor."

But Vasishtha insisted! He called his special cow, Kamadhenu. This was no ordinary cow! She could grant wishes!

Vasishtha told Kamadhenu, "Dear cow, please make a wonderful feast for the king and his army!  Make yummy food of every kind!"  And Kamadhenu did just that!  The king finally agreed to enjoy the amazing feast.
