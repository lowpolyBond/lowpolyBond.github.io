Once upon a time, Prince Bharata went to a big meeting.  Many wise men were there, shining like the moon on a clear night.  A very wise priest named Vasishtha talked to Bharata.

Vasishtha said, "Bharata, your father, King Dasaratha, loved everyone.  He gave you this kingdom. Your brother, Rama, always does what's right. He followed his father's wishes, just like the moon always shines. Now, it's your turn to rule!"

But Bharata was sad. He knew Rama should be king. Rama is the oldest brother.  Bharata said, "How can I be king when Rama is so good and wise?  He deserves the kingdom. It belongs to him!"

Bharata felt it would be wrong to take Rama's place.  He said, "This kingdom belonged to my father, and his father, and so on.  It should go to Rama, the best and oldest son. Taking the kingdom would be a very bad thing to do!"

Everyone at the meeting agreed with Bharata. They all loved Rama.  Bharata cried. He decided he would go find Rama and bring him home.  He said, "If I can't bring Rama back, I'll live with him in the forest!"

Bharata asked his friend Sumantra to get the army ready.  Sumantra was happy to help.  Everyone wanted to help bring Rama back!  The army, with horses, carts, and elephants, got ready to go to the forest.

Bharata got into his chariot.  He told Sumantra, "Let's go find Rama! We need him to rule the kingdom." Sumantra quickly told everyone to get ready.  People brought camels, horses, elephants, and carts to help on the journey. Everyone was excited to bring Rama home.
