King Dasaratha was very sad.  Queen Kaikeyi had been mean! She had asked for something terrible.  The king was confused.  He wondered if he was dreaming, or sick, or if a bad star was making him feel this way.

He calmed down a little, but then he remembered what Kaikeyi wanted. He felt scared and shaky, like a deer seeing a lion! He sighed deeply and sat on the ground. He looked like a sleepy snake.  “Oh, no!” he cried, and fainted.

When he woke up, he was still very angry. He looked at Kaikeyi, his eyes blazing.  “You bad woman! You're destroying our family!” he shouted. “Rama has always been kind to you. Why are you so cruel? I brought you here, and now you’re hurting me! Everyone loves Rama. Why would I send him away? I could give up anything – my other wives, my kingdom, even my life – but not Rama! I can’t live without him!”

The king begged Kaikeyi.  “Please, be kind. If you want to test my love for Bharata, do it another way. You once praised Rama. Was that a lie?”

He said Kaikeyi must be under a bad spell. “Our family is known for being good.  This isn't like you! You said you loved Rama!” he cried.  “How can you ask for him to be sent away for fourteen whole years?  Rama is brave, kind, and good. He is always respectful to you.”  He listed all Rama’s good qualities: brave, kind, honest, and always helpful.  “No one will ever serve you better than Rama!”

The king pleaded with Kaikeyi, saying his life was almost over. "Please, have mercy! I’m begging you. Save Rama!"

But Kaikeyi was stubborn. “If you go back on your promise, everyone will think you’re a liar!” she said. “You must keep your word, just like other kings in our family did.  Rama must leave, or I will kill myself.”

The king was heartbroken. He cried out, “Rama! Rama!” and fell to the ground like a fallen tree. He felt crazy!  He begged Kaikeyi to change her mind.  He explained how sad everyone would be – his other wives, Rama's mother, even his other son, Bharata.  He said people would think badly of him. He said he’d never survive it.  He said Rama was kind and good, and didn’t deserve this.

He told her how Rama, who loved nice clothes and good food, would have to live in the forest, wearing simple clothes and eating only berries. He felt terrible about the whole thing.

The king kept begging. He was like a lost child. But Kaikeyi wouldn’t listen.  He fainted at her feet, his heart broken.
