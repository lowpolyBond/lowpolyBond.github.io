Hanuman, a brave monkey, went to a mountain to see Rama and Lakshmana.  He bowed to them and to Sugriva, the monkey king.  Then, Hanuman told a very important story.

He told them about Sita, Rama's wife.  She was trapped by the mean king Ravana!  She was kept in his palace with scary giant women.  They were mean to her, but Sita was very brave. She never forgot Rama.  Hanuman said Sita would be killed soon.

Rama was worried.  He asked, "Where is Sita?  What does she think of me?"

The monkeys asked Hanuman to tell them everything.  Hanuman bowed his head and told the story again. He showed Rama a beautiful jewel Sita had given him.

Hanuman said, "I flew across a HUGE ocean to Ravana's island, Lanka.  I found Sita in Ravana's palace. She misses you, Rama! Those giant women are very unkind.  Sita is sad and thin, but she still loves you very much. She’s praying for you. She said she might only live for a month."

Hanuman explained that Sita had given him the jewel as a proof that she was okay and that she was still true to Rama. He also reminded Rama about a special mark on her face, a red dot.  Sita had asked Hanuman to tell Rama: "Even though I’m far away, I see you when I look at this jewel. But soon I will die. I only have one month left."

Hanuman finished his story.  He gave Rama the jewel. Rama and Lakshmana were happy to hear Sita was still alive and faithful.  Now they knew they had to save her!  They needed to cross that big ocean to Lanka!
