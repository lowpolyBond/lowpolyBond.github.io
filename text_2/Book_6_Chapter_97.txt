On that fierce field, where chaos reigned supreme,
Where arrows flew like sparks in nightly dream,
The monkeys faced a hail of arrows, dire,
From Ravana's wrath, a storm of flaming fire.

As moths before a blazing fire must flee,
So monkeys ran from arrows, swift and free.
Ravana, like a tempest, charged ahead,
His army scattering monkeys, filled with dread.

The fearless Sugriva, swift in the fray,
Took charge, prepared to fight another day.
With tree in hand, he charged the demon horde,
While monkey-warriors followed, undeterred.

Sugriva's mighty roar shook land and sky,
He crushed the demons, making giants fly.
His blows were like a storm that none could stand,
As trees were smashed like dust within his hand.

The demon Virupaksha, fierce and bold,
With bow in hand, a tale of might untold,
Descended from his chariot, full of grace,
Mounted an elephant, prepared to face.

His arrows rained on Sugriva, fierce and true,
But monkey-king stood tall, his courage grew.
A tree in hand, he struck the elephant's face,
Which roared in pain, retreating from the chase.

Descending then, Virupaksha's sword held high,
He faced Sugriva, hatred in his eye.
But Sugriva, undaunted, stood his ground,
With fists of fury, strength in every pound.

A rock he hurled, like thunder in the sky,
At Virupaksha, as the battle's cry.
But the demon, swift, evaded the blow,
Striking Sugriva, bringing him low.

Yet, Sugriva rose, his rage renewed,
With fist of fury, courage unsubdued.
A thunderous slap upon the demon's brow,
Sent Virupaksha reeling, pain on his brow.

Sugriva's chest took blows of sword, so keen,
Yet rose again, his spirit still unclean.
A mighty slap, a thunderclap so loud,
Struck Virupaksha, lost within the crowd.

He reeled, his temple crushed, a dreadful sight,
His body oozed with blood, his strength in flight.
Monkeys saw this demon's gruesome plight,
And both armies roared, like oceans in their might.

As Virupaksha fell, bathed in crimson red,
Both demon and monkey armies filled with dread.
The battlefield, like Ganga in her surge,
With blood and chaos, told a tragic dirge.
