King Ravana was a very mean king. He had a big army of giants, called titans.  These titans fought bravely against the monkey army, led by Sugriva.  Many monkeys were hurt and fell to the ground.  It looked like a terrible storm of arrows!

The monkeys were scared and ran away.  But Sugriva, the brave monkey king, wouldnâ€™t give up. He told his best friend Sushena to take charge, grabbed a big tree, and ran towards the titans.  All the other monkey leaders followed, carrying big rocks and trees.

Sugriva roared like a lion and attacked!  He threw rocks like a big storm, hitting the titans hard.  The titans fell down like broken trees in a strong wind.

Then, a strong titan named Virupaksha jumped from his chariot. He rode an elephant and charged at Sugriva. He threw many sharp arrows.  Sugriva was hurt, but he was still angry!

Sugriva roared and swung his tree, hitting the elephant so hard that it fell down. Virupaksha jumped off, and they fought with swords.  Sugriva got hurt, but he kept fighting.  He punched Virupaksha hard, making him fall to the ground.

The fight was fierce!  Both sides fought hard.  It was noisy, like two big crashing waves!  Finally, Sugriva hit Virupaksha so hard that he fell down, hurt and bleeding.

Sugriva had won! Even though lots of monkeys and titans were hurt, Sugriva's bravery helped the monkeys fight back. The battle was loud and messy, but the monkey army was stronger because of their brave leader.
