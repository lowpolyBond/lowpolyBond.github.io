Rama and Lakshmana came back to their home.  It was empty!  Sita, Rama's wife, was gone!

Rama was very sad.  "Lakshmana," he cried, "Where is Sita?  Has someone taken her?  Sita, are you playing a trick on me?  Please stop! I miss you so much! Even the deer we played with are sad without you."

Rama was so heartbroken, he thought he couldn't live without Sita.  He felt like his father would be very angry with him.

Lakshmana tried to cheer Rama up. "Don't worry, brother!" he said. "Let's look for Sita. She loves the forest. Maybe she's near the lake, or hiding in a cave to surprise us!"

So Rama and Lakshmana searched everywhere. They looked near the lake, in the caves, and all over the mountain.  But they couldn't find Sita.

Rama was so sad again. "I can't find Sita anywhere," he said sadly.

Lakshmana said, "Let's search the Dandaka Forest. That's a big forest, and maybe she's there."

Rama and Lakshmana searched the whole forest, but still no Sita. Rama was so upset he fainted! He called out for Sita, but she didn't come. Lakshmana tried to comfort him, but Rama was too heartbroken.  He just kept calling Sita's name.
