Hanuman, the strong monkey, bowed to Rama and Sita.  He felt very sad.  He thought hard, tears in his eyes.  He said, "Sita, Rama's wonderful wife, is in trouble.  It's sad, but things happen. Rama and Lakshmana are so brave and good, but Sita is still sad."

Hanuman remembered how strong and brave Rama was.  Because of Sita, Rama had defeated many, many bad guys! He fought Bali, Kabanda, and Viradha. He even defeated fourteen thousand demons! He won Sugriva's kingdom for her!  Hanuman even crossed a huge ocean for her! Hanuman thought, "If Rama had to turn the whole world upside down for Sita, he would!"  Sita was more important than anything.  She was so kind and good.  She was like a princess, found in a field as a baby.

Sita had left her home to be with Rama in the forest. She lived simply, happy just to be with him.  Now, she was far from home, unhappy and alone with mean demons. She missed Rama so much.  She is so beautiful, but without Rama, she doesn't shine.  Only Rama's bravery keeps him going. Hanuman saw Sita, sad and weak under a tree, guarded by scary demons. She looked like a wilting flower.  He felt so sorry for her.

Hanuman knew it was Sita.  He climbed a Shingshapa tree to watch over her.
