Sugriva bowed to Rama.  Rama hugged him and said, "It's no surprise you're so good!  You're like the sun, shining bright, and the rain, bringing good things. With me as your friend, you'll win every battle!"

A bad demon, like the one who stole the wife of a god, stole Sita. Sugriva promised to defeat the demon, Ravana, just like a brave god defeated a bad king long ago.

Suddenly, the sky went dark!  The ground shook!  Thousands and thousands of monkeys appeared!  They were strong and had sharp teeth. They came from everywhere â€“ mountains, rivers, forests, even the sea!

Monkeys the color of the sun, the moon, and flowers rushed to help.  There was Shatavali with tens of thousands, Tara's father who looked like a golden mountain, and Hanuman's father, Kesharin, with many more.  Gavaksha, the king, brought millions.  Dhumra came with bears.  Panasha brought millions more, and Nila, who was as big and dark as a mountain of coal, brought ten million!  Gavaya shone like gold, and Dari-mukha brought a billion monkeys!  Even more came with Mainda and Dvivida, Gaja, Jambavan, Rumana, Angada, Tara, Indrajanu, Rambha, Durmukha, and Hanuman himself, each with huge armies.  So many monkeys filled the land!  They all cheered for Sugriva and Rama!

Sugriva told Rama all his monkey friends had arrived. Then he told his army chiefs, "Get your troops ready!"
