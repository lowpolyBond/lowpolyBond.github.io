Bharata was telling a friend about a scary dream.  Suddenly, messengers arrived! They were tired from their long journey.

They went to see King Kaikeya and Prince Yudhajita.  The messengers gave Bharata a message: "Go back to Ayodhya!  Something important happened!"  They gave Bharata beautiful clothes and jewels for his uncle.

Bharata was worried. He asked the messengers, "Is my father okay? Is Rama okay? Is Lakshmana okay?  Is my mother Kaushalya okay?  And my other mother, Sumitra?  And my mother Kaikeyi?"

The messengers said, "Everyone is fine!  Go home quickly!"

Bharata said, "I need to say goodbye to the King." He told his grandfather he had to leave.

King Kaikeya hugged Bharata and said, "Go see your mother and father! Tell them I said hello.  Tell Vasishtha and the other wise people hello too! Tell Rama and Lakshmana I send my best wishes!"

King Kaikeya gave Bharata lots of presents:  elephants, clothes, jewels, horses! Prince Yudhajita gave him more elephants and mules!  He even gave him strong guard dogs!

Bharata was so happy for the presents but still worried about his dream and the urgent message. He said goodbye and left.  He had a big group with him: elephants, horses, and even camels!  He was ready to go home fast.
