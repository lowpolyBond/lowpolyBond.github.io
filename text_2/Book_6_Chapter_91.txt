Lakshmana, marked by auspicious grace,
In combat's heat, his foe did face.
With bloodied limbs, he stood his ground,
Indrajit's defeat, a victor's crown.

To Jambavan and Hanuman's might,
And all the monkeys, strong in fight,
Lakshmana offered salutation deep,
Then turned his steps, his wounds to keep.

With Vibhishaṇ and Hanuman's aid,
To Rama's side, he swiftly strayed.
Beside his brother, unwavering and true,
As Vamana stands by Indra, too.

With murmured voice, his tale he told,
Of Indrajit's fall, in tones controlled.
Vibhishaṇ joined, the news to bear,
Of Indrajit's doom, in the midnight air.

Rama, on hearing, filled with delight,
Embraced Lakshmana, his beacon of light.
With words of praise, he greeted his kin,
Their victory now, a battle to win.

Smelling his head, a brother's embrace,
With tender love, in that sacred place.
Lakshmana, wounded, bloodied and sore,
Found strength in Rama's love once more.

Again he smelled, his brother's head,
With arrow-pierced body, almost dead.
With soothing strokes and words that heal,
Rama's love for Lakshmana, so real.

A noble deed, a difficult task,
Lakshmana accomplished, no need to ask.
With Indrajit's fall, their foe was crushed,
Rama's heart with victory, deeply flushed.

As the right hand of Ravana severed in strife,
Lakshmana's feat, the turning of life.
Indrajit's death, their path now clear,
In this battle epic, their victory near.

Three days and nights, Indrajit tried,
But fate was sealed, and he finally died.
Their enemy's son, by Lakshmana's hand,
Rama's path to victory, a step so grand.

Ravana, distressed, would surely come,
With mighty forces, to beat the drum.
But Rama was ready, his heart held no fear,
For his beloved Sita, his victory near.

With Indrajit gone, their task was done,
Rama spoke to Sushena, wise as the sun.
"Attend to Lakshmana, his wounds to mend,
So he may stand by my side, my dearest friend."

"Let him be free from arrow's pain,
And all our heroes, their health regain.
Heal their wounds with utmost care,
Our gallant warriors, strong and rare."

Sushena, wise and brave, obeyed the call,
Treated Lakshmana, one and all.
With medicine's touch, their pain was eased,
Inhaling the herbs, their strength increased.

Lakshmana, now free from arrow's sting,
His spirit restored, like a mighty king.
With wounds healed, and fever gone,
In Rama's presence, he stood strong.

With arrow wounds healed, and fatigue erased,
Lakshmana's strength once more embraced.
Rama, Sugriva, Vibhishaṇ, and the rest,
In joy and relief, their hearts were blessed.

Rama praised Lakshmana's noble feat,
Sugriva's heart with joy did beat.
Indrajit's fall, a tale they shared,
In victory's light, their hearts declared.
