Once upon a time, in a great battle, a powerful warrior named Indrajit fought bravely.  He was the son of the evil king Ravana.  Indrajit's horses were killed, but he was still angry and strong! He and Lakshmana, a brave monkey warrior, fought like two huge elephants.

Many monkeys and giants fought too. They didn't want their leaders to lose.  Indrajit shouted to his giant friends, "Fight bravely! I'll be back!" He quickly went back to his city, Lanka.

He got a new, shiny chariot with sharp weapons.  Then, he zoomed back to the battlefield in his fast chariot.  Indrajit rained down arrows.  Lakshmana, with amazing skill, broke Indrajit's bows!  Then he hit Indrajit with sharp arrows.

Indrajit fought back.  He shot many arrows at Lakshmana, but Lakshmana didn't move!  He kept fighting bravely.  Lakshmana also hit Indrajit with many arrows. They both fought hard, hitting each other with arrows until Indrajit's charioteer was killed. His horses ran on without a driver, and then Lakshmana made them run away too.

Indrajit got very angry. He shot more arrows, but Lakshmana’s armor protected him.  Then, Indrajit hit Lakshmana’s forehead, and Lakshmana hit Indrajit’s face.  They fought with even more power.  Bibishana, a giant who helped the monkeys, even killed Indrajit’s horses!

Indrajit jumped from his chariot and threw a spear. But Lakshmana cut it in half with his arrow!  Bibishana then threw arrows at Indrajit. Finally, Indrajit used a super-powerful arrow.  But Lakshmana had a super-powerful arrow too, from a powerful god! Their arrows crashed together and broke into pieces!

Lakshmana then used a very special arrow. He asked a god for help, and said, "If Rama is good, let this arrow kill Indrajit!". The arrow flew and cut off Indrajit's head!  Indrajit fell dead.

The monkeys cheered! The giants ran away, scared. The good gods were happy.  Everyone celebrated because a bad guy was gone, and peace had returned. The monkeys praised Lakshmana for his bravery!  The battle was over.
