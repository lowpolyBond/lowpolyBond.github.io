King Dasaratha wanted his son, Rama, to become king.  Rama was very brave and kind.  He lived in a beautiful palace with his lovely wife, Sita.

Sumantra, the king's charioteer, went to tell Rama that his father wanted to see him.  He passed through lots of gates.  At one gate, strong guards stood ready to protect the queens.  They politely told Rama and Sita that Sumantra was waiting.

Rama, who looked as handsome as a god, was sitting on a fancy golden couch with Sita beside him. Sita was as beautiful as the moon. Sumantra bowed to them and gave Rama a message from the King.  The message said King Dasaratha and Queen Kaikeyi wanted to see Rama.

Rama happily agreed to go. He told Sita, "My mother wants to talk about me becoming king! It's going to be a great day!" Sita smiled and wished him well. She said a special prayer for his safety.

Rama left with Sumantra.  His brother, Lakshmana, was waiting for him.  Rama greeted his friends who had come to celebrate.  Then, Rama climbed into his amazing chariot.  It was shiny and golden, pulled by strong horses.  People cheered, "Jai! Jai!"  They threw flowers as Rama's chariot went by.

The women shouted, "Rama is going to be king! Sita is the luckiest woman!"  Everyone was so happy.  The streets were full of people, elephants, and horses.  Rama looked like a shining prince.  He was ready to become king.
