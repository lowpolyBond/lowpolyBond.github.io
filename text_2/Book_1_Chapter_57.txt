Once upon a time, a wise man named Vishvamitra felt very sad. He had been mean to another wise man, Vasishtha, and he felt bad about it.  He wanted to be a better person.

So, Vishvamitra went far away to a quiet place. He prayed and meditated for a very long time.  After many years, he had four amazing sons who were kind and brave.

After a thousand years of praying and being good, a powerful god named Brahma appeared! Brahma said, "Vishvamitra, you've become a very holy man!"

But Vishvamitra was still sad. He said, "Even after all this time, I'm still not as good as I want to be." He decided to pray and be good for even longer!

Now, there was a king named Trishanku.  He wanted to go to heaven while he was still alive! He asked Vasishtha for help, but Vasishtha said, "No, King, that's not possible."

Trishanku was upset. He went to find Vasishtha's sons, who were also very holy men.  He bowed down and asked them for help.  He said, "Please help me!  Vasishtha said no, but you are good and wise, and I need your help to go to heaven!"
