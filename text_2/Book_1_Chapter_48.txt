King Pramati saw two amazing princes.  They were strong and brave, like gods!  He asked a wise man, Vishvamitra, "Who are these wonderful boys?"

Vishvamitra told the king a story.  The princes, Rama and Lakshmana, were on a journey. They had even fought some bad monsters!  King Pramati welcomed them and gave them a place to sleep.

The next day, Rama and Lakshmana traveled to a beautiful city called Mithilapuri.  They saw a pretty empty house, a hermitage. Rama asked Vishvamitra, "Why is this lovely place empty?"

Vishvamitra told them a sad story.  Long ago, a wise man named Gautama lived there with his wife, Ahalya.  Indra, the king of the gods, tricked Ahalya and was mean to her.

Gautama, when he found out, was very angry. He was so angry that he made Indra weak. He also made Ahalya turn into stone!  He said she would stay like that until a very special prince named Rama came and helped her.

Then Gautama left his beautiful home, sad and angry.  That's why the hermitage was empty.  And that is the story of the empty house.
