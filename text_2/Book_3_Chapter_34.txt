A mean sister named Shurpanakha ran to her brother, King Ravana.  She was angry!  "Brother!" she cried, "Rama is so strong! He's incredibly handsome, too!"

Ravana, the king of the demons, was furious. "Who is this Rama?" he roared. "What is he doing in the Dandaka forest? Tell me everything!"

Shurpanakha told him all about Rama. "He's the son of King Dasaratha," she said. "He's strong like a god! He shoots amazing arrows, like fiery snakes! He even killed fourteen thousand demons â€“ Khara and Dushana were among them!"

"He's kind, too," she continued. "He wouldn't hurt a woman. But his brother, Lakshmana, isn't so gentle.  He hurt me!"

"And Rama's wife, Sita," Shurpanakha whispered, "is the most beautiful woman ever!  She's like a goddess.  Her skin is golden, and her eyes are like the moon. You *must* see her!"

Shurpanakha had a plan. "Ravana," she said, "Rama and Lakshmana are powerful, but they're not as powerful as *you*!  Take Sita!  She'll be your queen! You'll be so happy!"

Ravana listened carefully. He was already thinking about Sita's beauty. He knew Rama had defeated many demons.  This made him want Sita even more. He decided to listen to his sister.  He would take Sita, even if it meant a big fight with Rama.
