King Rama was having a fun time!  He was with his friends – Vijaya, Madhumatta, and lots more. They were telling jokes and funny stories.  Rama laughed a lot.

But then Rama asked his friend Bhadra, "What are people saying about me? About Sita, my wife? About my brothers, Bharata, Lakshmana, and Shatrughna?  About my mother, Kaikeyi? Kings always hear what people think, even if they're in the forest!"

Bhadra bowed and said, "Everyone in the city says wonderful things about you, King! They talk about how you beat the terrible Ravana!"

But Rama wanted to hear everything, even the bad things.  He said, "Tell me everything, even if it's not nice. I want to know what people are really saying."

Bhadra bowed again and said, "Some people are saying…'Rama built a HUGE bridge across the ocean!  No one has ever done that before, not even the gods! He beat Ravana and made the monkeys and bears obey him.  He got Sita back, but…how can he still love Sita after Ravana held her?  What if our wives were taken too? Will we be able to love them again?'"

Rama was very sad. He asked, "Is that really what people are saying?"

All his friends bowed and said, "Yes, Your Majesty."

Rama felt very unhappy. He said goodbye to his friends and went to think about what he had heard.
