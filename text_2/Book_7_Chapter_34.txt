Once upon a time, a powerful demon king named Ravana loved to fight strong people. He traveled all over the land, looking for someone to battle.

One day, Ravana arrived at a monkey city called Kishkindha. He wanted to fight King Bali, the strongest monkey ever!  But Bali wasn't there.  Bali's friends, Tara and Sugriva, told Ravana that Bali was away doing his evening prayers by the ocean.  They teased Ravana, saying he was no match for Bali.

Ravana was angry! He flew away to find Bali.  He found Bali doing his prayers by the sea.  Ravana tried to grab Bali secretly, but Bali saw him!

Bali thought, "This is Ravana!  I'll catch him!"  Bali was very strong, like a mountain. He quickly grabbed Ravana and tied him to his waist!  Then, with one big jump, Bali flew into the air!

Ravana's friends tried to stop Bali, but Bali was too fast. He zoomed past mountains and oceans. He finished his prayers at each ocean, all while carrying Ravana! Finally, he took Ravana back to Kishkindha.

Bali was tired of carrying Ravana. He untied him and laughed.  Ravana was amazed!  He'd never been beaten before! He was so impressed by Bali's strength that he became friends with him. They promised to always help each other.  They even became brothers in a special ceremony by the fire.

Ravana stayed with Bali for a month, but then his friends took him away.  Later,  Rama, a very strong hero, defeated even Bali.  Bali was incredibly strong, but even he was not stronger than Rama!
