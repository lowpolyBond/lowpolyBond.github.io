Long ago, in a land far away, lived a brave prince named Rama.  His wife, Sita, was kidnapped by the ten-headed demon king, Ravana. Rama, with his brother Lakshmana and his monkey army, went to Lanka, Ravana's island kingdom, to rescue her.

Rama's monkey general, Sugriva, was very brave.  He fought many battles without waiting for Rama's orders. Rama hugged Sugriva and said, "Sugriva, you're very strong, but a king must think before he acts.  Your bravery worried me! What if something happened to you?"  Rama explained that without Sugriva, he would have given up hope and died of sorrow.

Sugriva said, "Seeing the monster who took Sita, I couldn't help but fight!"

Rama then looked at Lakshmana.  The sky was dark and scary. The wind howled, the earth shook, and animals cried out in fear.  Rama knew a big battle was coming. He said, "Lakshmana, let's get ready! This battle will be huge!"

Rama and his army marched towards Lanka.  There was Bibishana (Ravana's good brother), Hanuman (the super-strong monkey), and many more brave monkeys and bears.  They surrounded Lanka.  Rama and Lakshmana stood at the city gates.

Rama sent Angada, a strong monkey, to Ravana. Angada told Ravana, "Rama says, give Sita back! If you don't fight, and let Bibishana rule, you can still live."

Ravana was angry! He ordered his soldiers to capture Angada. But Angada was so strong, he broke free and went back to Rama.

Ravana was furious.  Rama's army was huge!  Monkeys everywhere! Even the air was full of them.  The demon soldiers were scared.  The battle was about to begin!
