Hanuman, a strong monkey, zoomed from one mountain to another! He found Sugriva, the monkey king.  "King Sugriva," Hanuman said, "this is Rama, a brave prince, and his brother Lakshmana.  Rama's father was a great king, and Rama is very good and kind."

Hanuman explained that a mean guy named Ravana stole Rama's wife, Sita. Rama was looking for help.  "Rama and Lakshmana need your friendship," Hanuman said.

Sugriva was so happy! "It's wonderful to be friends with you, Rama!" he exclaimed. He shook Rama's hand.  Hanuman made a fire. Rama and Sugriva went around the fire, becoming best friends. They hugged and laughed.

Sugriva told Rama his sad story.  "My brother, Bali, is mean! He took my wife and made me hide in the forest!" he cried.

Rama smiled. "Don't worry!" he said. "I'll help you! My arrows are super strong. I'll defeat Bali!"

Sugriva was so happy!  "Thank you, Rama! Please help me get my wife and kingdom back!"

As Rama and Sugriva became friends, something amazing happened! Sita's eye twitched. So did Sugriva's, and even Ravana's eye twitched!  They all felt the change.  The adventure was about to begin!
