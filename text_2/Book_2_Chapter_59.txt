King Dasharatha's charioteer, Sumantra, returned from taking Rama to the forest.  His horses were tired and sad.  Sumantra stayed with a friend for a few days, hoping Rama would call him back.

When he returned to the city of Ayodhya, everything was different. The trees looked sick. The water was low.  The animals were quiet. Even the flowers had lost their smell!  The whole forest was sad because Rama was gone.

Ayodhya was sad too.  Everyone missed Rama.  When they saw Sumantra's empty chariot, they cried.  The women looked out their windows, weeping.  Even Sumantra was very sad.  He felt lost and heartbroken.  Ayodhya felt as empty as Queen Kaushalya's heart without her son, Rama.

King Dasharatha was heartbroken too! He told Sumantra how sorry he was. He had sent Rama away because he listened to his wife Kaikeyi's mean friend, Manthara.  He regretted his decision. He pleaded with Sumantra to take him to Rama.  He wanted to see his son one last time before he died. He described Rama, his beautiful son, and said he couldn't live without seeing him.

The king was so sad that he fainted!  His wife, Queen Kaushalya, was terrified to see him like that. She was also very sad that her son, Rama, was gone.  The whole kingdom was filled with sadness.
