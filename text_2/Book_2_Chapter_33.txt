Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana were leaving the city.  They gave lots of presents to the priests.  Their servants carried weapons decorated with pretty flowers and sweet-smelling sandalwood.

People climbed on top of their houses to watch them go.  They were very sad. Some whispered, "Rama used to have a big army! Now he only has Sita and Lakshmana with him."

Others said, "Rama is so good. He always helps people. He’s going because his father promised something a long time ago.  And poor Sita, she’s never even been seen by many people before!"

Some people were angry.  "The king must be crazy to send his best son away!" they cried. "Rama is kind, smart, brave, and honest!  Everyone loves him!  It's like the birds losing their water in summer – we’re so sad without him!"

Others shouted, "Let's go with Rama!  Let this city be empty and dusty. Let Kaikeyi and her son live here! We’ll go to the forest and be happy with Rama!"

Rama heard them, but he didn't get upset. He walked slowly and calmly, like a big elephant, toward the palace.  He saw his father’s friend, Sumantra, looking very sad.  Rama smiled and asked Sumantra to tell his father that he had arrived. Rama was ready to go to the forest, but he wanted to see his father one last time.
