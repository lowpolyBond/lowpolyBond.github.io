Prince Rama was a strong and brave prince.  His stepmother, Queen Kaikeyi, made a mean request. She wanted Rama to leave his kingdom and live in the forest for fourteen years!

Rama was sad, but he was a good son.  He said, "Okay, I will go. I will live in the forest, with simple clothes and messy hair. But why won't my father talk to me himself?"

Rama promised to give his kingdom to his brother Bharata. He even said he would give up everything – his wealth, his wife Sita, and even his own life – to make his father happy. He asked Queen Kaikeyi to explain this to the King.

Queen Kaikeyi was happy that Rama agreed.  She sent fast horses to bring Bharata, Rama's brother, home. She told Rama to leave right away.  Rama's father, the King, was so upset he fainted!

Rama helped his father. Then, even though Queen Kaikeyi was mean, Rama said, "I didn't want the kingdom for power. I wanted to be good and fair.  Serving my father is the most important thing to me. I will go to the forest for fourteen years, even though it's your wish, not the King's."

Rama said goodbye to his mother and Sita, his wife.  He told Bharata to rule the kingdom fairly and to take care of their father.

Rama was very brave and kind. He didn't show anger or sadness. He went to the ceremony to make Bharata king. Then he left without looking back, like a brave yogi.

Rama said goodbye to his friends, still smiling. He went to see his mother, Kaushalya, and tell her the bad news.  His brother Lakshmana, who was very angry, went with him.

Even though Rama was leaving everything behind, he kept smiling. He was as calm and bright as the moon, even though the moon gets smaller sometimes.  He was a truly good and brave prince.
