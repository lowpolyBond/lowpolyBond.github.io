One morning, as the sun peeked over the horizon, musicians came to the palace.  They played beautiful music and sang songs about the king.  Birds sang, too! Everyone in the palace was happy. Servants got ready to help the king wake up. They brought him water, special oils, and shiny combs.  They waited for him to wake up.

But something was wrong.  The king didn't wake up!  The women who usually helped him noticed he wasn't breathing. They were very scared.  They shook him gently, but he was gone.  The king had died.

The king’s wives, Queen Kaushalya and Queen Sumitra, were very sad.  Their hearts were broken. They felt so weak and sick that they fell down.  All the women in the palace cried.  They cried so loudly that Queen Kaushalya and Queen Sumitra woke up.  They touched the king’s cold body. They cried, "Oh, my Lord!"  They were heartbroken and fell to the ground.

The other queens were so sad they fainted, too. Everyone in the palace was crying. The palace, usually so happy, was filled with sadness.  The king’s family and friends hugged him and cried. They were very, very sad.
