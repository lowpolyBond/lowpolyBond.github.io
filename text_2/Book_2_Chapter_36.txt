King Dasaratha was very sad.  He had made a promise he couldn't break. He told his friend Sumantra, "Get ready a big army for Rama!  Lots of food, beautiful things, and clever traders should go with him.  Ramaâ€™s friends and servants should go too.  They need everything they'll need in the forest."

King Dasaratha continued, "Rama will hunt and explore.  He'll be happy, but he'll miss us.  All my wealth and food will go with him. He'll live happily in the forest, praying with wise people.  Bharata will be king here."

Queen Kaikeyi was scared.  She couldn't speak.  She finally whispered, "Bharata won't want a kingdom without people and treasure!"

King Dasaratha was angry.  He shouted, "Why are you making me so sad?  You wanted Rama to go, but you didn't say he had to go with nothing!"

Kaikeyi got even angrier.  She said, "King Sagara sent his son, Asumanjas, away with nothing!"

King Dasaratha cried, "Oh, no!" Everyone felt bad, but Kaikeyi didn't care.

Then, a wise minister named Siddhartha spoke to Kaikeyi.  "Asumanjas was a bad man! He hurt children. That's why he was sent away," said Siddhartha.  "Rama is good. He hasn't done anything wrong!  There's no reason to send him away without anything."

King Dasaratha was heartbroken.  He told Kaikeyi, "You're not listening!  I'll go with Rama.  You can rule with Bharata.  I don't care about my wealth or the palace anymore."
