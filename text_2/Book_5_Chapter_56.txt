Hanuman bowed to Sita, who was sitting under a tree.  "Sita!" he said, "I'm so happy you're safe!"

Sita looked at Hanuman.  "Please, my friend," she said, "stay hidden today. Rest. Leave tomorrow.  Seeing you makes me feel a little better. But I'm so worried!  Will Sugriva, the monkey king, and his army ever cross the big, scary ocean?  And how will Rama and Lakshmana get here? Only a few can jump that far.  You're one of them.

"Can you even do it? Only Rama, as brave as he is, could possibly rescue me from this island!  Please, help Rama get me back."

Hanuman said, "Don't worry, Sita! Sugriva and his army are coming. Rama and Lakshmana will be here soon. They'll fight the bad guys, and Rama will bring you home. You'll be reunited with Rama very soon, just like the moon and its star Rohini!"

Hanuman felt happy to help Sita. He said goodbye.  He was so strong, he had already helped make the city a mess for the bad guys!

Hanuman wanted to see Rama again, so he climbed a HUGE mountain. This mountain was amazing! It was so tall, and full of trees, waterfalls, and animals. It even looked like a giant!  When Hanuman stepped, the rocks broke!

He reached the top, and saw the ocean.  It was huge and scary! But Hanuman was super strong! He jumped!  He jumped so far, the mountain crashed down behind him!  Animals ran away. It was a really amazing jump!

Hanuman flew over the ocean, ready to tell Rama that Sita was safe.
