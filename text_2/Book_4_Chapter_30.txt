Rama was very sad.  He missed his wife, Sita, terribly.  The rainy season was over, and the autumn nights were beautiful and clear.  But Rama only felt sadder.  He looked at the moon and the stars, and he thought about Sita.

He wondered what Sita was doing.  Did she miss him too?  He remembered how she loved to hear the cranes calling in the forest.  Now, she was all alone.  Rama felt heartbroken. He sat on a golden mountain, wishing he was with her.

Just then, Lakshmana came back. He had been looking for food.  He saw Rama looking sad and worried. Lakshmana knew Rama needed to find Sita.

"Brother," Lakshmana said, "why are you so sad?  We need to find Sita! We have a plan, and we need to do it now!  Don't let sadness stop us.  Sita is strong, and we will find her!"

Rama agreed.  He knew Lakshmana was right.  He looked at the beautiful autumn sky. The clouds were gone. The animals were happy. It was time to act. He still missed Sita, but he knew he had to be brave.

Rama explained that the rainy season was over.  Now was the time when kings went to war. It was time for them to find Sita!

Rama told Lakshmana to go to Sugriva, the monkey king, who had promised to help them. Rama said, "Tell Sugriva that he promised to help us find Sita. He must keep his promise! If he doesn't, I will be very angry!"

Lakshmana agreed. He knew Rama was right.  He was angry at Sugriva too.  He went to find Sugriva and tell him what Rama said.  It was time to start their journey to save Sita!
