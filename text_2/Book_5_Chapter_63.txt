A little monkey named Dadhimukha bowed down to King Sugriva.  Sugriva said, "Up, little one! What's wrong? Tell me everything!"

Dadhimukha said, "King, the monkeys went wild in our honey orchard!  They ate all the honey and fruit!  My guards tried to stop them, but the monkeys hurt them badly!"

Lakshmana, a friend of the king, asked, "Who is this monkey, and what's happened?"

Sugriva explained, "That's Dadhimukha.  It sounds like Angada and the other monkeys are back from their big search!  They probably found Sita!  Only super-strong monkeys like Hanuman could do that."

Sugriva smiled. He was so happy! Lakshmana and Rama, another friend of Sugriva, were happy too!

Sugriva told Dadhimukha, "Tell the monkeys to come here right away! I want to talk to them!"  Sugriva was sure his friends had found Sita.  He was very, very excited.
