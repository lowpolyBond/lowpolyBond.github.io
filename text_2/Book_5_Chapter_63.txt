Upon seeing Dadhimukha's humble bow,
Sugriva spoke, his mind in agitated flow:
"Valiant monkey, rise and tell your tale,
Why prostrate at my feet, what makes you frail?"

With confidence, Dadhimukha stood upright,
And spoke the truth, in the king's sight:
"Madhuvana, O king, never before set free,
By Riksharajas, nor Vali, nor even thee.

Consumed by monkeys, the grove's delight,
They eat the fruits and honey with all their might.
Some throw the remnants, some consume the trace,
They defied the guards, with a fierce embrace.

Enraged, the guards tried to keep them at bay,
But monkeys, with red eyes, had their say.
They drove the guards, with anger in their glance,
Some beaten with hands, others felt the lance.

With knees, they struck, tossing them high,
Their defiance, the monkeys could not deny.
O king, these monkeys, so valiant and bold,
Consumed Madhuvana, as the story is told."

Lakshmana, wise and fierce in fight,
Asked, seeking to understand the sight:
"O king, what brings this guardian here?
What grief compels him to speak so clear?"

Sugriva replied to Lakshmana's request,
Explaining the deeds of monkeys, the best:
"Returned from the south, our heroes bold,
Consumed the honey, as the story is told.

Madhuvana's destruction, they have achieved,
Our mission, I believe, is now achieved.
Sita must have been found, none can deny,
None but Hanuman could reach the sky.

In Hanuman, strength and wisdom combine,
In his veins, valor and courage entwine.
With Jambavan and Angada to lead,
Our mission's progress, we must heed.

Madhuvana's ruin, a sure sign,
That our mission is close to the line.
Our heroes wouldn't have indulged so grand,
If they hadn't accomplished the task at hand."

Pleased by these words, Rama's face did shine,
Lakshmana and he, hearts filled with joy's wine.
Sugriva's delight, he couldn't conceal,
For the end of their quest, now seemed real.

Sugriva, then to Dadhimukha turned,
His gratitude and forgiveness earned:
"I pardon the monkeys who caused this strife,
Their mission accomplished, their part in life.

I long to see Hanuman and his band,
The lion-hearted heroes who took a stand.
To hear of their efforts, to find Sita fair,
With Rama and Lakshmana, my heart they share."

Rama and Lakshmana, their joy so clear,
Sugriva's words, they held dear.
Their mission's success, they could now perceive,
Their hearts and souls, with joy, did heave.
