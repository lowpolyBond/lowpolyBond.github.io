Lakshmana, Rama's younger brother, helped Sita, the princess, into a boat.  He told his charioteer, Sumantra, "Wait here with the chariot!"  Then, feeling very sad, he told the boatman to go.

When they reached the other side of the river, Lakshmana knelt down, his face wet with tears.  He said to Sita, "Rama, my brother, is in great trouble because of you. People are saying bad things about him. I feel terrible! I'd rather die than do what I have to do." He bowed his head to the ground.

Sita was scared. "What's wrong?" she asked. "Tell me! Is Rama alright?"

Lakshmana, his voice shaky, explained, "Rama heard people gossiping about you.  He's very upset, even though I know you've done nothing wrong. He's sent me to leave you near some holy places, where wise saints live.  He said it's to make you happy.  It's a secret, but he doesn't want you with him anymore."

Lakshmana pointed to the beautiful, peaceful forest. "These are sacred places, Sita.  Sage Valmiki, a very good friend of your father, lives nearby. You can live there and stay safe.  Be good and kind, and always remember Rama in your heart.  That's how you'll be happy."
