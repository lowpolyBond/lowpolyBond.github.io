King Ravana heard the sad cries of his people in Lanka.  He was angry!  His eyes were red, and he looked scary, even to his own strong warriors.

He shouted, "Find Mahodara, Mahaparshva, and Virupaksha!  Get my army ready for battle!"

His warriors quickly obeyed. They prayed and bowed to Ravana. Then they marched to battle.

Ravana laughed a mean laugh.  "Today," he roared, "I will kill Rama and Lakshmana! I will avenge my brothers and son!  My arrows will rain down like a storm!  I will crush the monkey army! I will make the earth red with their blood!"

He ordered his chariot to be brought. It was beautiful, shiny, and full of weapons.  All his warriors were amazed. Ravana climbed onto his chariot.  It looked like a thousand suns!

The sound of his army was HUGE!  Everyone heard the noise.  People shouted, "It's Ravana!  The one who stole Sita! He's going to fight!"  The ground shook!

Ravana was ready for battle.  His friends Mahodara and Virupaksha joined him.  They shouted loudly.

But before the battle even started, bad things happened!  The sun went dim. Birds cried sadly. The ground shook again.  Even Ravana felt a little scared; his eye twitched!  A shooting star fell!

But Ravana ignored the bad signs.  He was determined to fight.

The monkey army and Ravana's army were ready to fight!  Ravana's arrows flew fast and strong. Many monkeys were hurt. Some lost their heads, others were wounded.

Ravana was a powerful warrior, and the battle had begun.
