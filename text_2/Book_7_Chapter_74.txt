A sad, sad thing happened! A poor Brahmin's baby died.  The Brahmin cried and cried.  The king, King Dasharatha, was very upset. He called all his important people â€“ his wise advisors, his brothers, and the city elders.

Eight very wise Brahmins came.  They greeted the king nicely. Prince Rama, the king's son, was also very sad. He told everyone about the baby's death.

A very wise Brahmin named Narada explained what happened.  He said, "Long ago, only Brahmins could pray and do special things to please the gods. Then, only warriors could do it too.  Then, farmers could also.  Now, in this time, *everyone* can pray and do special things."

But, Narada said, "A very long time ago, people lived much longer. Then, as things changed, people didn't live as long. A bad thing happened! A Shudra (someone from a lower group of people) was doing something only higher people were supposed to do! That is why the baby died."

Narada told the king, "You must find the Shudra and stop him. If you do, people will live longer, and maybe the baby will even come back to life!"  The king knew he had to find out what happened and make things right.
