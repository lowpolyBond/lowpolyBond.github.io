Once upon a time, a kind king had to send his son, Rama, away to live in the forest.  Rama was good and kind, like his mother, Queen Kaushalya.  She was very sad.

"Oh, King," she cried, "Rama is so kind and gentle. How will he and his wife, Sita, live in the forest?  Sita is used to a soft bed and delicious food, not sleeping on the hard ground and eating wild berries!  How will she bear the scary sounds of the forest? How will Rama, so strong and brave, live without his comfy home?"

The Queen worried about everything. She worried about how Rama would sleep, and how Sita would eat. She worried about the dangers of the forest.  She asked, "Will Rama ever come back?  Will his brother Bharata give him back his kingdom?  Rama is like a lion; he is so strong and noble, he would never take the kingdom from his brother."

The Queen was so heartbroken. She told the King, "You have made a terrible mistake! You have hurt your family, your kingdom, and yourself!"  She cried and cried.

The King felt very, very sorry. He was so sad that he fainted, falling to the ground like a tree hit by lightning.  He was heartbroken too.  The whole kingdom was sad because of Ramaâ€™s banishment.  This was a very sad day for everyone in the land.
