Hanuman heard General Tara talk.  He thought Angada, Bali's son, was trying to take over! Angada was super smart and strong. He was brave like his dad and very wise.  Hanuman wanted to help Angada see the right way.

Hanuman decided to trick Angada a little. He wanted to make Angada scared. He shouted, "Angada, you’re strong!  Maybe even stronger than your dad! But the monkeys are tricky! They miss their families. They won't follow you!"

"Jambavan, Nila, Suhotra, and even *I* won't help you," Hanuman said. "Strong monkeys rule!  Weak monkeys need to be smart.  You’re hiding in a cave, but Lakshmana can easily shoot arrows through it! His arrows are super fast and strong, like lightning!"

"The monkeys will leave you if they remember their families," Hanuman warned.  "You'll be all alone, scared even by a tiny leaf! Lakshmana's arrows will find you. But, Angada," Hanuman said softly, "If you come with us to Sugriva, he'll make you king! He's a good king and wants what's best for you.  Your uncle loves your mom, and she only has you. Come home, Angada!"
