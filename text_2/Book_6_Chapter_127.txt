After fourteen long years away, Rama, Lakshmana's older brother, finally returned.  It was the fifth day of the moon's cycle.  He went to see a wise old man named Bharadvaja.

Rama bowed respectfully and asked, "Wise one, is everyone in the city okay? Is my brother Bharata doing well? Are my mothers safe?"

Bharadvaja smiled. "Bharata is waiting for you! He's following your orders, ruling the kingdom carefully. He treats your sandals like they're precious, showing his respect."

He continued, "When you left, walking, wearing only simple clothes, your wife with you, I felt so sorry.  You were banished, following your father's wishes, leaving behind all comfort.  You were like a god pushed out of heaven! You ate simple fruits and roots. But now, you've won!  You're surrounded by friends and family. I am so happy!"

Bharadvaja knew everything that had happened to Rama:  how his wife Sita was taken by the evil Ravana, his battles, his friends the monkeys, and how he defeated Ravana and rescued Sita.  He knew all about Rama's amazing journey!

Bharadvaja said, "My students are already telling the city the good news!  I'll give you a gift, brave warrior, but first, accept this offering. Tomorrow, you can go home to Ayodhya!"

Rama bowed and happily said, "Thank you!" Then he made a wish: "Along the road to Ayodhya, even though it's not the right time of year, I wish all the trees would have sweet, delicious fruits, smelling like heaven itself. I wish there would be every kind of fruit imaginable!"

Bharadvaja said, "So it shall be!"

Suddenly, the trees along the path changed!  They were filled with beautiful flowers and the sweetest fruits.  The monkeys who were traveling with Rama were overjoyed, eating the magical fruits and feeling like they were in paradise!
