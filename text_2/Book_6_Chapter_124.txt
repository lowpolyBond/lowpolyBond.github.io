When the sun came up, Rama woke up happy.  Bibishana bowed down and said, "Rama, I have everything ready for your bath!  Beautiful things like special oils, jewelry, and flowers.  Lovely ladies are waiting to help you."

Rama said, "Thank you, Bibishana, but first, let's have my monkey friends and Sugriva bathe.  My brother Bharata is waiting for me back home. He’s sad because I’m gone. I don’t care about baths or jewels right now.  Let’s go home quickly! The journey is long."

Bibishana said, "Don't worry, Rama! I have a magic flying car, the Pushpaka!  It's super fast, like the sun!  Ravana stole it, but now it’s yours. You can fly home in a day!"  He added, "Please, stay just one day!  It would mean so much to me."

Rama said, "Thank you, Bibishana, you've been so kind. But I miss my brother Bharata, my mother, and my home. I need to go see them."

Bibishana said, "Okay, Rama.  I understand." He quickly got the Pushpaka ready.  It was a beautiful flying car, shiny and golden, with lots of pretty gems and bells.  It looked like a sparkling mountain!

Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita were amazed by the Pushpaka.  They were ready to go home!
