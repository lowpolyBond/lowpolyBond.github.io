Prince Rama, a brave and good boy, met a wise old man named Vishvamitra.  Vishvamitra asked Rama for help.  Rama said, "I will do anything my father, the king, asks me to do. I will help you!"

Rama was a great archer. He picked up his bow and *twang!* The sound was so loud, it scared all the forest animals! A scary monster, a yakshini named Taraka, got really angry.  She was huge and ugly!

Rama said to his brother Lakshmana, "Look at that monster! She's awful, but I won't kill her.  I'll just stop her from hurting anyone."

Taraka roared and attacked! She threw rocks and dust everywhere.  Rama and Lakshmana couldn't see!  Rama fought bravely, cutting off Taraka’s hands. Lakshmana cut off her nose and ears.  

Taraka kept changing shapes and throwing more rocks!  Vishvamitra shouted, "Rama, she's too dangerous! You must stop her!"

Vishvamitra showed Rama where Taraka was hiding. Rama shot many magic arrows.  They flew straight to Taraka!  Finally, Rama hit Taraka in the heart.  She fell down, and died.

The gods in the sky cheered, "Well done, Rama!" They gave Rama special magical weapons.

That night, Rama and Lakshmana rested in the forest.  The forest was beautiful now, because Taraka’s magic curse was broken. Everyone was happy.  Rama was a hero!
