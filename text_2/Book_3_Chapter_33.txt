Shurpanakha, Shurpanakha's nose and ears were cut off by Rama.  She was very angry! She stormed to her brother, Ravana, a powerful king.

"Brother!" she cried, "You're too busy having fun! You don't see the big trouble coming!  A prince named Rama is very strong. He's already defeated a huge army of your soldiers! He's made the forest safe again, but you don't care because you’re too busy being lazy and selfish!"

Shurpanakha explained that a good king needs to listen to his people, and know what's happening.  "You have no spies to tell you what's going on," she said. "You're like a king who’s asleep when his kingdom is on fire! A good king protects his land. You don't! You only care about yourself."

She warned him, "Rama is a brave warrior. He'll defeat you if you don't wake up!  A king who is mean, lazy and proud will lose everything.  People won't help him, even his own family will turn against him!"

Ravana, who was rich and proud, thought about what his sister said. He was quiet for a long time, thinking and thinking. He was a powerful king, but was he a *good* king?
