Rama was talking to a wise man named Agastya.  Agastya had just told Rama a wonderful story.  Rama was curious about a spooky, empty forest.  "Why are there no animals in this forest?" he asked. "King Shveta used to live here and pray, but why is it so empty?"

Agastya smiled and started to tell Rama another story.  "Long ago," he said, "there was a king named Manu. Manu was a great king, like a super-king! He had a son named Ikshvaku.  Manu told Ikshvaku, 'Be a great king and start your own family of kings!'

Manu also told Ikshvaku, 'Always be fair! Only punish people if they do something wrong. Being a good king will take you to heaven!' Then Manu went to live with the gods.

Ikshvaku wanted to have lots of sons. He prayed and did good deeds.  He had ONE HUNDRED sons! But his youngest son was silly and didn't listen. Ikshvaku named him Danda, which means 'stick' because he needed a good 'stick' to make him behave!

Ikshvaku didn't know where to send Danda. So he gave Danda some land between two big mountains.  Danda built a beautiful city called Madhumanta.  He got a wise teacher to help him rule.  Danda was a good king after all, and his people were happy. He ruled his city like a god!"
