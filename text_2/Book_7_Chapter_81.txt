A wise teacher, Shukracarya, and his students were very hungry after a long day.  They came back to their home, and saw Shukracarya's daughter, Aruja, covered in dust and sad.  Shukracarya was so angry! He was like the moon hidden by a shadow, dark and upset.  He was starving, and his anger grew even bigger.

He shouted, "King Danda was very mean! He was disrespectful!  Because of my anger, a terrible thing will happen! In seven nights, King Danda, his family, and his whole army will be gone!  A huge cloud of dust will cover his kingdom for miles and miles! Everything will turn to dust!"

Shukracarya told everyone to leave their home. But he told his daughter Aruja, "You stay here, my dear.  Meditate by the beautiful lake.  The animals who come to you will be safe."

Aruja, very sad, said, "Okay, Father."

Shukracarya went to a new home.  Just like he said, seven nights later, King Danda's kingdom turned into a dusty desert!  It's called the Dandaka Desert today.  The place where Shukracarya and his students lived became a new village.

Then, Shukracarya finished telling the story. He said, "The sun is setting. It's time for prayers.  You should wash up too, Rama."
