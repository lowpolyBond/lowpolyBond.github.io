Ravana, a giant and powerful king, found Sita.  He boasted, "I'm so strong, I can lift the Earth! I can drink the ocean! Even death can't defeat me!" He showed Sita his scary ten heads and twenty arms.  He was angry and looked like a burning fire.

Ravana said to Sita, "I'm a great king.  Marry me! Forget Rama. He's lost his kingdom and is weak."

But Sita refused.  Ravana was furious! He grabbed her and threw her into his golden chariot pulled by mules.  Sita cried, "Rama! Rama!"  But Rama was far away.

As Ravana flew away with Sita, she shouted, "Lakshmana! Rama!  Help me!  Ravana is wicked and strong, but you will defeat him!" She begged the trees, the river, and even the animals to tell Rama what happened.

Sita saw a big bird, Jatayu.  She asked him to fly to Rama and Lakshmana to tell them she'd been kidnapped by Ravana.  Jatayu promised to help.
