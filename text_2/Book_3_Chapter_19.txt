A mean demon named Khara found his sister, Shurpanakha, hurt and bleeding on the ground.  "Sister!" he roared, "Tell me what happened! Who did this to you?"

Shurpanakha was scared and upset.  Khara was very angry. He said, "Who dared hurt you?  I will get revenge! No one is strong enough to hurt you and get away with it!"

Shurpanakha cried and told her brother what happened.  "Two very handsome men, like princes," she sobbed, "with a beautiful woman. They hurt me because of her!"  She wanted revenge too!

The two men were Rama and Lakshmana.  They were princes, strong and kind.  Shurpanakha didnâ€™t know they were princes.

Khara was furious. He gathered fourteen super-strong demon friends.  "Those two men and the woman are in the forest," he shouted. "Kill them! My sister wants their blood!"

The fourteen demons, with Shurpanakha, ran off to find Rama and Lakshmana.  They wanted to make Shurpanakha happy, even if it meant hurting others.
