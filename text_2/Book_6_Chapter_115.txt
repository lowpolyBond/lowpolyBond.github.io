After defeating the bad king Ravana, everyone celebrated!  The gods, the magical beings, and even some giants were all happy. They talked about how brave Rama was, how strong the monkey army was, and how loyal Sita was to Rama.  They all went home, very happy.

Rama gave back Indra's amazing flying chariot. He thanked the chariot driver, Matali, and Matali flew back to the sky.

Rama hugged his friend Sugriva and Lakshmana. Then, everyone cheered as Rama went back to the monkey camp.

Rama told Lakshmana, his best friend, "Let's make Bibishana, Ravana's good brother, the new king of Lanka! He helped us, so he deserves it."

Lakshmana said, "Great idea!"  He got a golden pot and asked some monkeys to get water from all four oceans.  The monkeys zoomed around and brought the water back super fast!

Lakshmana put Bibishana on a special seat and, using the special water, made him king of Lanka.  The monkeys and giants all cheered! Bibishana was happy, and so were Rama and Lakshmana.  Bibishana talked kindly to his people.  Then, he brought Rama and Lakshmana yummy food â€“ yogurt, rice, sweets, and flowers!

Rama then spoke to Hanuman, the strong monkey who looked like a mountain.  Rama said, "Hanuman, go back to Lanka and find Sita. Tell her we're all okay and that Ravana is dead.  Bring back her message when you're done!"
