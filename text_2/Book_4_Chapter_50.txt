Hanuman, Angada, and Tara, three brave monkeys, went on a big adventure. They were looking for Sita, Rama's wife.  They explored deep, dark forests and caves in the Vindhya mountains.  Lions and tigers roared!  The caves were scary!

They walked and walked, until they found a cave.  It looked cool and shady.  Birds were flying out, all wet and covered in flower dust.  The cave smelled nice.

Hanuman, the strongest monkey, said, "Let's go inside!  Maybe there's water there."

The monkeys went into the cave.  It was dark and spooky! They heard scary sounds â€“ lions roaring, birds chirping.  But they were brave.

They walked and walked, deeper and deeper.  Then, wow!  The cave opened up into a beautiful, magical place!

It was shining bright.  There were sparkly golden trees and flowers everywhere!  There were pretty lakes with golden fish and blue lotus flowers.  They saw amazing palaces made of gold and silver!  There was yummy food, sweet drinks, and soft blankets.

Suddenly, they saw a woman. She was wearing simple clothes, and she looked wise.

Hanuman, the big, strong monkey, bowed politely and asked, "Who are you?  Whose amazing cave is this?"
