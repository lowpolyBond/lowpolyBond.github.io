Once upon a time, a powerful god named Mahadeva went to the mountains to meditate.  The other gods were worried!  They were having trouble having babies.  They went to Brahma, the creator god, for help.

"Brahma," they said, "Mahadeva is meditating, and we can't have babies!"

Brahma was kind. He said, "A powerful goddess cursed you.  But don't worry!  Agni, the fire god, will help. He'll have a baby with the River Ganga."

The gods were happy! They asked Agni to do it.  Agni agreed.  He spoke to Ganga, the river goddess.

"Ganga," Agni said, "let's have a baby – the gods need a hero!"

Ganga agreed.  She became a beautiful nymph.  Soon, she felt very hot and bright inside!  She was glowing like fire!

"Agni!" she cried, "I can't handle this heat!  Help me!"

"Put the baby near the Himalayas," Agni told her.

Ganga put the baby down.  It shone so brightly that everything around it turned to gold!  Trees, plants, even the mountains – all turned golden! This baby was special.

The gods asked some kind ladies called the Krittikas to take care of the baby. He had six mouths and drank milk from six different mothers at once! They named him Karttikeya, and sometimes Skanda because he was born a little early.  He grew strong and brave.

Karttikeya grew up to be a super strong warrior who fought the bad guys. The gods made him their leader!

This is the story of Karttikeya, a brave warrior born from fire and a river!  If you believe in this story, you’ll have good luck!
