Lakshmana, a strong and angry warrior, stormed into Sugriva's monkey kingdom.  Sugriva, the monkey king, saw Lakshmana's anger. He was worried. Lakshmana was very upset because his brother Rama was in trouble.  Sugriva, sitting on his fancy throne, jumped up.  He went to Lakshmana, looking like a giant tree.  The monkey queen, Ruma, and all the other monkey ladies followed, like stars around the moon.

Lakshmana was furious. He told Sugriva, "A good king is kind, honest, and always grateful. But a bad king is unfair and forgets his friends.  Lying is terrible!  Lying about a horse is like killing a hundred horses! Lying about a person is even worse – it hurts everyone.  You, Sugriva, promised to help Rama find his wife, Sita. You got your kingdom back thanks to Rama, but you haven’t kept your promise! That’s like killing everyone!  You can’t even be forgiven for that!

"Rama was kind and helped you. Now you only care about having fun! You’re not the great monkey king Rama thought you were!  You should be helping him, not enjoying yourself! You’re a liar and you’re ungrateful!"

Lakshmana looked very angry. He said, "Rama gave you your kingdom back.  But you broke your promise! Unless you help find Sita, you'll suffer the same fate as your brother Bali!" He pointed to his bow and arrows, but Sugriva, still scared, began to understand how ungrateful he had been.
