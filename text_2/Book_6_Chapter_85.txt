In grief, Rama could hardly hear,
Vibhishaṇ's words, so crystal clear.
The conqueror of hostile towns and towers,
Turned to the demon, in darkest hours.

"O Lord of Demons," Rama inquired,
"Speak again, as my heart is mired,
In sorrow's depths, I cannot see,
Clearly, the path that's meant to be."

Vibhishaṇ, with skillful expression,
Replied with words of deep compassion,
"O Hero, listen, without delay,
To what I have to earnestly say.

At your command, I marshaled the might,
Divided the troops for the coming fight.
Commanders and ranks, all were in place,
But, Rama, your grief, it's hard to face.

Abandon this sorrow, false and wrong,
It only empowers the adversary's throng.
To retrieve Sita and defeat the foe,
We must rise with courage and vigor, you know.

O Rama, heed my words, I pray,
Lakshmana must leave without delay.
To halt Indrajit and his vile rite,
With arrows sharp as the serpent's bite.

Indrajit, through penance's grace,
Has Brahmashira, a weapon in his chase,
Horses obedient to his command,
He's reached Nikumbhila's sacred land.

If he completes his unholy rite,
He'll vanish from sight, out of sight.
The gods themselves, in fear, will quiver,
So let Lakshmana go, make him the giver.

A boon from Brahma, Indrajit holds,
His death, in a certain way, foretells.
He who strikes while the rite's undone,
Will be the cause of his setting sun.

But Rama, with wisdom so vast,
Knew of Indrajit's powers that would last.
He spoke to Lakshmana, wise and keen,
Of the conjuring tricks yet to be seen.

"Lakshmana," he said, "beware the art,
Of Indrajit, who plays a deadly part.
His skills are vast, his might is great,
Invisible in battle, he'll seal your fate.

So go, my brother, with armies strong,
Sugriva's troops, the brave and long.
With Hanuman leading, and Vibhishaṇ true,
Defeat Indrajit, let your arrows slew."

Lakshmana, resolute, prepared to go,
With Vibhishaṇ, his courage did show.
He touched Rama's feet in solemn grace,
Then vowed to win this deadly chase.

As he spoke his words, strong and bold,
Lakshmana's resolve, like a torrent rolled.
He pledged that his arrows, sharp and true,
Would pierce Indrajit, his mission to pursue.

With his brother's blessings, he set out,
To Nikumbhila, without a doubt.
Hanuman and Vibhishaṇ too,
Followed him, as his mission drew.

Monkeys by the thousand, strong and free,
Accompanied Lakshmana, as far as the eye could see.
Jambavan's troops, their courage bright,
Stood ready to join this perilous fight.

Lakshmana pressed forward, no fear in his heart,
To Nikumbhila, where he'd make a fresh start.
To face Indrajit, with his conjuring art,
And strike him down, as the gods impart.

Through the enemy ranks, Lakshmana pressed,
Weapons gleaming, armor on his chest.
With swiftness and skill, he carved a path,
In the midst of darkness, he'd face their wrath.
