King Ravana's brother, Vibhishana, told Rama some important news. Rama was very sad, so he asked Vibhishana to repeat it.

Vibhishana said, "Rama, your army is ready!  But you look sad. Don't be!  Be brave!  You'll soon see Sita again!  We must stop Indrajit, Ravana's son, from doing a special magic ceremony. If he finishes it, we'll lose!  Indrajit has a powerful magic weapon and fast horses. He's at Nikumbhila Grove, doing the ceremony."

Rama said, "Vibhishana, you're right. Indrajit is very powerful!  His magic is like the sun hidden behind thick cloudsâ€”impossible to see! But my brother Lakshmana is brave. He can defeat Indrajit!"

Rama told Lakshmana, "Go with the monkey army and bear army.  Hanuman and Jambavan will lead them. Destroy Indrajit!  He will be followed by his helpers, so you can attack easily!"

Lakshmana was excited. He said, "Today, my arrows will destroy Lanka, like birds tearing up a lotus pond!  Today, Indrajit will fall!"

Lakshmana bowed to Rama and rushed off with Vibhishana, Hanuman, and the army.  He saw the bear army and then Indrajit's army, all ready for a big battle. Lakshmana, with his friends Angada and Hanuman, bravely went into the enemy's lines.  It was a huge, scary army, full of shining weapons and chariots. But Lakshmana was ready to fight!
