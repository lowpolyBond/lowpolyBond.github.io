Rama and Lakshmana were amazed by the stories Wise Vishvamitra told them.  "Wow!" they said. "That's an incredible story about King Sagara and the river Ganges!"

They listened all night.  When the sun came up, Rama said, "That was a wonderful story! It felt like just a moment! Now let's cross the river.  Other wise men have sent a boat for us."

Vishvamitra called the boatman.  They all crossed the river in the boat.  They rested on the other side.  In the distance, they saw a beautiful city!  It looked like a magical city from the sky!

Rama asked Vishvamitra, "What amazing city is that?"

Vishvamitra said, "I'll tell you a story about it, a story Indra told me.  Long, long ago, in a time called the Golden Age, two powerful beings, one a god and one a demon, wanted to be immortal. They decided to churn the ocean of milk! They used a giant snake as a rope and a mountain as a stick to churn.

They churned for a thousand years!  The snake spat out poison!  It was terrible!  The gods were scared. They cried out for help!  Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu came!

Vishnu said to Shiva, "You are the leader. You should take the poison." Shiva drank the poison!  He was so strong!

The gods and demons kept churning. Then, the mountain started to sink! The gods cried for help again.  Vishnu turned into a giant turtle and held up the mountain!

After more churning, a magical doctor appeared! Then, beautiful dancing women appeared from the ocean!  A magical horse and a jewel also appeared!  And finally, the water of immortality!

The gods and demons fought over the magic water. Vishnu turned into a beautiful woman and tricked the demons, taking the water for the gods!

Indra, the king of the gods, won the fight and ruled happily ever after!"
