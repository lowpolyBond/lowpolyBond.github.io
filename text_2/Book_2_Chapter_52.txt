One morning, Rama, a strong and brave prince, woke up.  "Lakshmana," he said, "the sun is coming up! Listen to the birds singing in the forest. Let's cross the fast-flowing river."

Lakshmana, Rama's brother, went to find Guha, a kind man who helped them.  Guha quickly got a strong boat. "Here's your boat, Prince Rama!" he said.

Rama thanked Guha. "Put our things in the boat," he told him.  Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita (Rama's wife) got ready to go.

Then Rama spoke to Sumantra, his friend and the chariot driver. "Sumantra, go back to the King. I don't need you anymore. I'm going to the forest."

Sumantra was very sad. He cried, "Oh, Rama! Everyone will be so upset!"  He begged Rama not to go.  Rama was kind, but he explained he had to.  He asked Sumantra to tell the King, his mother, and everyone that he was okay and would return in fourteen years. He also asked Sumantra to make sure Bharata, his brother, became the King.

Sumantra cried again, but finally agreed to go back.  He promised to deliver Rama's message.

Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita got into the boat. Sita prayed to the river goddess, Ganga, to keep them safe.  They crossed the river.

On the other side, Rama said, "Lakshmana, protect Sita. I'll walk behind you both." They started their journey into the forest.  Sumantra watched them go, very sad.

In the forest, they ate berries and roots. At night, they slept under a tree.  Their adventure had begun!
