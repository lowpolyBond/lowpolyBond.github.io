Once upon a time, the gods and wise people were very scared.  Powerful demons, the sons of Sukesha, were bullying everyone!  They were so strong because they had magic powers. They even said things like, "I am the king of the Gods!" and "I am the Sun!"  The gods were scared and needed help.

They went to Shiva, the great god who creates and destroys everything. They begged him, "Please help us!  These demons are terrible!"

But Shiva said, "I can't kill them. But I know who can! Go ask Vishnu, the god who protects everyone."

So, the scared gods went to Vishnu. They bowed down and said, "Please help us! The demons live in a strong city called Lanka. They are taking over heaven!"

Vishnu, who is very strong and brave, said, "Don't worry! I will defeat these demons!"  The gods were so happy! They went home, feeling much better.

The strongest demon, Malyavan, told his brothers, "The gods asked Shiva for help, and he sent them to Vishnu! We must fight him!"

Malyavan's brothers agreed. They were proud and powerful. They boasted, "We are too strong! No one can beat us!"  They had magical animals and weapons. They were ready for a huge battle.

They marched towards the gods' home, ready to fight.  The sky turned dark, and there were scary storms.  This was a warning that something bad was about to happen. But the demons didn’t care.

Vishnu heard about this. He got on his amazing bird, Garuda, and flew to battle! He had his magical weapons ready: a discus, a sword, and a bow and arrow.  All the good creatures cheered him on.

Garuda’s wings were so strong, they blew away the demons’ weapons.  The demons fought back fiercely, but Vishnu was too powerful!  He defeated the evil demons and saved the gods.  Everyone was safe and happy again!
