The monkey army was amazing!  They were strong and brave. They fought the giants with all their might.  The giants rode on shiny elephants and horses, and in sparkling chariots. They wanted to win for their king, Ravana.

The monkeys fought back fiercely!  There were amazing battles everywhere. Angada fought Indrajita, a very strong giant. Hanuman fought Jambumali.  Sugriva fought Praghasa. Lakshmana fought Virupaksha.  Many other monkeys fought many other giants! It was a huge, noisy battle.

Lots of monkeys and giants got hurt.  There was blood everywhere.  It looked like a terrible storm had passed through.

Angada broke Indrajita’s chariot! Sampati, a giant, was hurt by Parjangha. But Sampati hit back with a big tree! Hanuman’s chest was hurt, but he smashed Jambumali’s chariot! Nala scratched out Pratapana’s eyes!

Lakshmana beat Virupaksha.  Rama, super strong, killed four giants with just four arrows! Nila killed Nikumbha, a giant. Dvivida, a strong monkey, killed another giant!  Sushena fought Vidyunmalin, a tricky giant.  They hit each other hard! Finally, Plavaga hit Vidyunmalin so hard that he died!

Many, many monkeys and giants died.  The battlefield was full of broken chariots, dead horses, and bodies.  It looked awful, like a messy fight between gods and demons.

The giants were tired and bleeding. They wanted the fighting to stop.  They couldn't wait for night to come!  But the monkeys were ready to fight again the next day.
