Hearing Sugriva's words, so wise and true,
Dadhimukha paid his reverence due,
To Rama and Lakshmana, noble and strong,
With grateful heart, he joined the throng.

With valiant monkeys, by his side,
Into the air, Dadhimukha did glide,
In Madhuvana, he found them all,
The chiefs of monkeys, answering their call.

With hands together, in salute he came,
And spoke to Angada without any blame:
"O noble sir, those guards in their ire,
Obstructed you, their intentions dire.

Forgive their ignorance, hold no grudge,
You are the prince, this grove's great judge.
I made a mistake, told your uncle, the king,
About your arrival, which made his heart sing.

He's pleased to hear of your great feat,
No anger in him, no harsh words to repeat.
He said, 'Send all the monkeys here,'
To celebrate your success, my dear."

Angada, hearing Dadhimukha's voice,
Made a noble and wise choice:
"No need to linger, our work is done,
The honey's consumed, the battle won.

The monkeys are resting, their task complete,
It's time to return, our mission sweet.
I'm obedient to all, though I'm the prince,
I won't command, I won't convince."

The monkeys praised Angada's humility,
His words were filled with nobility.
None but he, in their eyes, could see,
Such grace and wisdom in royalty.

"Who else would speak like this?" they said,
With admiration for Angada's head.
"His humility, a trait so rare,
Promises a future bright and fair."

Angada, then, with resolve so strong,
Said, "Let's move, it's not too long."
The mighty monkeys sprang to the sky,
With joyous hearts, they began to fly.

Like stones from a catapult, they soared,
Their journey to Sugriva's court, they implored.
Their cheers and roars, in the air they flung,
As to their king and lord, they swiftly clung.

Before Angada touched the ground below,
Sugriva addressed Rama, his face aglow:
"Be pacified, dear Rama, don't be sad,
The princess is found, no longer be mad.

Sita must have been found, it's clear to see,
None but Hanuman could set her free.
His strength and wisdom, like no other,
Have brought us closer to finding my brother.

With Jambavan and Angada in his band,
Our mission's success is close at hand.
Madhuvana's ruin, a sign so bright,
That we are close to reuniting, tonight."

Hearing these words, Rama's joy did bloom,
Lakshmana, too, dispelled his gloom.
With hearts elated, their spirits soared high,
For the end of their quest was nigh.

Sugriva, then, to Dadhimukha turned,
Whose respect and reverence he earned:
"Thanks to you, we've reached this day,
Let's go to meet our heroes, without delay."

With joyful hearts, they left the scene,
To meet the monkeys, noble and keen.
Their mission, at last, was almost complete,
As they headed to where Hanuman they'd greet.

Angada and Hanuman, leaders so grand,
Guided the way to their monkey band.
With joy and triumph, they soared through the air,
In eager anticipation, their king they'd declare.

Arriving before Angada could touch the ground,
Sugriva spoke, his voice full of sound:
"Be glad, my friend, for Sita we've found,
Thanks to your courage, her rescue is bound."

Then Hanuman, mighty and wise,
With a humble salute and tears in his eyes,
Informed Rama, with words like nectar so sweet,
That Sita was found, her heart's pulse to beat.

Rama and Lakshmana, their joy did ignite,
For Hanuman's message brought them delight.
With reverence, they looked upon their king so bold,
Whose bravery and loyalty, their hearts consoled.
