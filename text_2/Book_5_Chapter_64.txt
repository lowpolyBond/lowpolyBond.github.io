Sugriva, the monkey king, talked to Dadhimukha. Dadhimukha bowed to Sugriva, then to Rama and Lakshmana.  He zoomed through the air, super fast! He landed in the Madhu forest.  There, he found Angada and the other monkeys. They had eaten lots of honey!

Dadhimukha told Angada, "Don't be mad at the guards!  You're the prince, the honey is yours!  Sugriva is happy you found the honey. He wants everyone to come back!"

Angada spoke to his friends. "Dadhimukha told Rama everything. We've done our job. Let's go back to Sugriva!"  The monkeys agreed. They all loved Angada; he was kind and humble.

Then they all flew back, so many monkeys it looked like rocks falling from the sky!  Angada and Hanuman led the way.

When they arrived, Angada told Sugriva, "Rama, don't worry! We found Sita!"  Sugriva was happy!  He knew because the monkeys were so happy, and they wouldn't have come back without Sita. They wouldn't have messed up the Madhu forest either, if they hadn't found her!

Suddenly, they heard lots of happy monkey shouts!  The monkeys landed, all excited.  Hanuman bowed to Rama and said, "I saw Sita! She's safe!"

Rama and Lakshmana were so happy! They were overjoyed!  Lakshmana thanked Sugriva, and Rama thanked Hanuman.  They were all so happy that Sita was found!
