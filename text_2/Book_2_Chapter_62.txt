King Dasharatha was very sad. Queen Kaushalya had said some hurtful things. He thought about what he'd done wrong.  He remembered accidentally hurting a holy man with an arrow a long time ago.

Now, he felt terrible because of that, and because he had sent his son Rama away.  He bowed his head and spoke softly to Queen Kaushalya. "Please, my dear queen," he said, "don't be angry with me. A wife should always respect her husband, good or bad. I know you're wise, but your words hurt me."

Tears streamed down Queen Kaushalya's face like rain.  She took his hands. "Oh, my king, please don't be sad," she said. "I'm so sorry! I shouldn't have spoken like that.  I'm a good wife, and I know you are a good king. I only said those things because I miss Rama so much.  It feels like five years since he left, not just five nights!  My heart aches without him."

The sun started to set.  King Dasharatha felt a little better after talking to his queen. He was still very sad, but he finally fell asleep.
