King Dasaratha's minister, Sumantra, was very angry.  He was so mad! He stomped his feet, his face turned red, and he wrung his hands. He was upset because Queen Kaikeyi had tricked the king.

Sumantra shouted at Kaikeyi. He said, "You've been very bad! You've hurt the king, our good leader. You've gone against everything that's right! You're like a murderer!"

He told her, "You asked the king to send Prince Rama away to the forest and make your son, Bharata, king instead.  That's not fair! Rama is the oldest son.  He should be king!  Everyone will be unhappy if Rama is sent away.  Nobody good will help Bharata rule."

Sumantra told a story about Kaikeyi's mother.  Her mother was also very mean.  She made her father tell her a secret, even when he said it would get him into trouble.  He said, "You are just like your mother!  You are doing wrong!"

Sumantra begged Kaikeyi to change her mind. "Please ask the king to let Rama be king," he pleaded.  "It's the right thing to do."

But Kaikeyi didn't listen.  She didn't change her mind at all. She remained stubborn.  She still wanted Bharata to be king.
