Rama and Lakshmana, brave brothers, were fighting a giant.  Many arrows flew!  They fell to the ground, hurt and covered in blood.  They looked like two golden statues.

Sugriva, the monkey king, and his friends, including Hanuman and Bibishana, rushed to them.  They cried, sad to see the brothers so badly hurt.

Indrajit, the giant's son, was very happy. He had won the battle! He boasted to all the other giants, "Rama and Lakshmana are defeated! My arrows are too strong, even the gods couldn't help them!"

Indrajit was a powerful magician. He had made himself invisible, but Bibishana could still see him.

Indrajit then attacked the monkey army. He hurt many monkeys, including Nila, Mainda, Dvivida, Jambavan, and Hanuman.  He shouted, "Look! I've trapped Rama and Lakshmana!"  The giants cheered, thinking Rama and Lakshmana were dead.

Sugriva was very scared. He cried and felt hopeless.  But Bibishana, a wise monkey, comforted him.  "Don't worry," he said. "This is just a battle.  Rama and Lakshmana are strong. They'll get better!" Bibishana encouraged the other monkeys, too.  He made them feel brave again.

Indrajit, proud of his victory, went back to his father, Ravana, the ten-headed giant king.  "Rama and Lakshmana are dead!" he shouted.

Ravana was overjoyed! He hugged Indrajit and celebrated. He was no longer afraid of Rama.
