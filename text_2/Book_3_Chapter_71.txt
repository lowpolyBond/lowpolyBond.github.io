Once upon a time, a very strong and handsome giant lived in the forest.  He was so strong and scary, he frightened everyone!  He even scared some holy men who were picking berries.  One of these holy men, very angry, put a curse on the giant.  The curse made the giant look terrible and gave him long, long arms!

The giant was sad. He asked the holy man to take away the curse. The holy man said, "Only Rama, the brave prince, can help you.  He must cut off your arms and burn your body."

The giant, whose real name was Danu, told Rama and his brother Lakshmana his sad story. He said that a powerful god, Indra, had punished him a long time ago, making him look like a monster. He had long arms that stretched for miles! He used them to catch animals for food.

Danu explained that Indra said only after Rama cut off his arms and burned his body would he be normal again.  He was waiting for Rama to do this.

Rama and Lakshmana were very sad. Their friend Sita had been taken away by a mean monster named Ravana. They didn't know where to find her.

Danu said, "I don't know where Ravana is, but after you cut off my arms and burn me, I will become normal again and I can help you find Sita!"

Rama and Lakshmana agreed to help Danu.  They made a big fire and did what the holy man said.  After they burned Danu, the giant changed back into his normal, handsome self.  And he promised to help Rama and Lakshmana find Sita. He said he knew someone who knew all about Ravana!
