Lakshmana, a very kind prince, listened carefully to what Sugriva, the Monkey King, said.  Sugriva had been scared, but now he wasn't anymore. He took off his fancy necklace and threw it away.  He felt bad for how he'd acted before.

Sugriva said, "Prince Lakshmana, Rama, your brother, gave me back my kingdom and my good name.  He's so strong! He shot one arrow and hit seven huge trees and a mountain!  He doesn't need my help!  I'll just follow him and help however I can.  Rama will defeat the bad King Ravana and bring back Sita."

Sugriva felt sorry for making mistakes. He said, "Please forgive me if I did anything wrong."

Lakshmana smiled. He said, "Sugriva, you're a good friend!  Rama will be happy to have your help. You are brave and true. Your kingdom will be safe and happy.  With you, Rama will defeat Ravana quickly.  You are strong, just like Rama!  The gods want you to help him. Letâ€™s go help Rama, who is very sad because Sita is gone.  I'm sorry if I said anything mean earlier."
