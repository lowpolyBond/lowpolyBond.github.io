Once upon a time, after a long night, Lakshmana felt sad. He told Sumantra, the chariot driver, "Please get the fastest horses and a comfy chariot ready for Sita.  King Dasharatha wants her to visit some wise holy men."

Sumantra said, "Of course!" He quickly got a beautiful chariot with soft cushions. He told Lakshmana, "It's ready!"

Lakshmana went to Sita and said, "The King wants you to go visit the holy men by the Ganges River. I'll take you."

Sita was happy! She packed beautiful clothes and jewels. "I'll give these to the holy men's wives," she said.

Lakshmana helped Sita into the chariot.  They started their journey.

On the way, Sita felt worried. "I have a bad feeling," she said. "My eye is twitching! I feel scared. Is Rama okay?" She prayed for everyone's happiness.

Lakshmana, though sad himself, said, "Don't worry, everything will be alright!"

They stopped near the river for the night.  The next morning, Lakshmana said, "Let's go! I'll carry water from the Ganges River on my head, like a strong hero!"

They reached the Ganges River. Lakshmana started to cry. Sita asked, "Why are you so sad? We're here!  It's only been a couple of days since we left Rama. He's important to me, but I'm not this sad. Let's cross the river, visit the holy people, and go home!"

Lakshmana wiped his tears. They found a boatman, who took them across the river.  Soon, Sita and Lakshmana were on their way to see the holy men!
