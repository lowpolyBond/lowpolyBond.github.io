Rama and his brother Lakshmana were very sad.  A mean giant named Ravana had taken Rama's wife, Sita.  A helpful monkey king named Sugriva wanted to help.

Sugriva's clever friend, Hanuman, told him about Rama's trouble.  Sugriva knew Ravana had stolen Sita and he saw her being carried away. She was crying, "Rama! Lakshmana!"  She even dropped her beautiful cloak and jewels while she was being carried away.  Sugriva and his friends picked them up.

Sugriva said to Rama, "I'll find Sita and bring her back!" Rama was so happy. He said, "Please go quickly!"

Sugriva zoomed to a cave, grabbed Sita's cloak and jewels, and rushed back to Rama.  Rama saw them and started to cry.  He held the jewels close and sobbed, "My Sita!"

Rama showed the things to Lakshmana.  Lakshmana knew Sitaâ€™s anklets because he often touched her feet.  Rama was furious.  He asked Sugriva, "Who is this terrible giant?  Where did he take Sita? I will find him and punish him!"
