Once upon a time, Sita, Rama's wife, was very sad.  She was crying by a river.  Some children saw her.  They were very kind.  They ran to find a wise old man named Valmiki.

"Wise Valmiki," they said, "a beautiful lady is crying near your home. She looks very upset.  We don't know who she is, but she needs help!"

Valmiki knew exactly who she was. He knew Sita was Rama's wife. He hurried to the river.  He saw Sita crying.

Valmiki was very kind. He gently said, "Dear Sita, I know why you're sad. You are Rama's wife.  You are a good person. Don't worry!  You are safe with me."

Valmiki had many kind women living near him.  He asked them to look after Sita.  The women were happy to help. They welcomed Sita like their own daughter.

Valmiki told the women, "This is Sita, Rama's wife. She's very special and needs our care."

Sita felt much better.  She knew she was safe now. She thanked Valmiki and went to live with the kind women.

The end.  We hope you liked the story!  May you always be happy and safe, just like Sita was with Valmiki and his friends!
