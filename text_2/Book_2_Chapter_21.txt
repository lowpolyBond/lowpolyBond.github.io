Once upon a time, in the kingdom of Ayodhya, lived a kind prince named Rama.  His father, the King, was tricked by a wicked stepmother, Kaikeyi.  She made the King send Rama away to live in the forest for fourteen years!

Rama's younger brother, Lakshmana, was very angry.  He told their mother, Queen Kaushalya, "This is unfair! Rama is the best! He should be king!" Lakshmana even said he would fight anyone who disagreed!  He was very brave and loyal.

Lakshmana also told Rama, "Brother, let's become kings ourselves! I'll protect you!"

Queen Kaushalya was heartbroken. She cried, "Rama, please don't go! I can't live without you!" She begged him to stay.

Rama was sad, but he was a very good and obedient son. He said, "Mother, I must obey my father, even if it's hard.  It's the right thing to do." He explained that even great heroes from the past always obeyed their fathers.

Rama also told Lakshmana, "My dear brother, I know you're strong, but fighting isn't the answer.  Doing what is right is more important."

Finally, Rama asked his mother for her blessing before he left.  Queen Kaushalya was still very sad, but she knew her son was a good person and that he would return.

So, Rama, with his wife Sita and his loyal brother Lakshmana, went to live in the forest.  He did what was right, even though it was very difficult.  He was a prince who followed the rules, even when it was hard.
