Once upon a time, after a wise man named Sharabhanga went to heaven, many holy people came to see Rama.  These were special people! Some ate only moonbeams! Others ate only grains. Some stood in water all day, and others slept on the ground.  Some lived outside all year long! They were amazing!

All these wise people, who had special powers, came to Rama's father's hermitage to ask for help. They spoke to Rama, a very brave prince.

"Rama," they said, "you are strong and kind! You are like the leader of the gods!  You protect everyone.  A good king protects his people like his own children.  The happiness of a good king is even greater than that of a holy person living in the forest.  The giants are hurting us! They're killing many holy people in the forest near Lake Pampa and the Mandakini River! We need your help!"

Rama listened. He was very kind. He said, "Don't worry!  I'm here to help you! I came to the forest to protect you from the giants.  It's my duty!  My brother Lakshmana and I will fight the giants!  You will see how strong we are!"

So, Rama and his brother Lakshmana, followed by all the happy holy people, went to fight the giants!
