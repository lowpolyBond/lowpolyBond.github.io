King Vishvamitra and his army fought against Sage Vasishtha's friends.  Many soldiers fell.  Sage Vasishtha asked Shabala, a magical cow, for help.  Shabala stamped her foot!  Suddenly, new soldiers appeared!  More sprang from her udders and even her hair!  They easily defeated King Vishvamitra's army.

King Vishvamitra's sons were angry.  They attacked Sage Vasishtha. But the sage just said, "Hmm!"  POOF!  All the sons disappeared!  The whole army was gone!

King Vishvamitra was very sad. He felt like a fish out of water, or a bird without wings.  He gave his kingdom to his last son and went to live in the forest.

After a long time, a powerful god, Lord Shiva, spoke to him.  "What do you want?" Lord Shiva asked.  "Teach me everything!" King Vishvamitra begged. "Teach me magic, weapons, and everything about the world!"

Lord Shiva said, "Okay!"  King Vishvamitra learned amazing things! He learned powerful magic weapons! He was so happy! He felt as joyful as a sunny day!

Now, King Vishvamitra decided he would defeat Sage Vasishtha. He attacked the sage's home in the forest!  He used his new magic weapons!  Whoosh!  The forest caught on fire!  Animals and birds ran away, scared!  The forest was empty!

Sage Vasishtha wasn't scared. He called out, "Don't worry! I will stop him!" Then, he shouted at King Vishvamitra, "You destroyed my home! Now, I will stop you!"  He picked up his big stick and got ready to fight!
