Once upon a time, King Ambarisha was doing a big, important ceremony called a sacrifice.  He was helped by a boy named Shunashepha.  They went to a special place called Pushkara.

While the King rested, Shunashepha got lost and very tired and thirsty. He found his uncle, a wise man named Vishvamitra, who was praying with other wise men.  Shunashepha was scared and sad. He cried, "I have no one! Please help me!"

Vishvamitra was kind. He wanted to help Shunashepha.  But the sacrifice needed a special person.  Vishvamitra asked his own sons to take Shunashepha's place.

But his sons were mean! They said, "Why should we help this boy?  We're more important!"  Vishvamitra was very angry. He was so mad, he cursed his sons! He said they would have to wander for a thousand years and eat dog meat!

Vishvamitra then helped Shunashepha.  He taught Shunashepha some special magic words.  He told Shunashepha to be brave and let them tie him to a post like they were going to use him for the sacrifice.

Shunashepha said to the king, "It's okay, we can start the ceremony now!"  The king was happy.  They dressed Shunashepha in pretty red clothes.  He was tied to the post. But Shunashepha said the magic words Vishvamitra taught him.

A powerful god, Indra, heard Shunashepha's words. He was so happy, he gave Shunashepha a gift â€“ a long and happy life!  The king finished his important ceremony.

Then, Vishvamitra went back to praying for a very long time, a thousand years! He was a very wise and powerful man.  And Shunashepha lived happily ever after.
