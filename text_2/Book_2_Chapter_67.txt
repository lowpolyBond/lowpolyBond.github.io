The night felt very long and sad for everyone in the city.  They were all crying.  When the sun came up, the wise men of the kingdom met.  These were very important people like Markandeya, Vamadeva, and others.

They talked to the head priest, Vasishtha. They said, "This past night felt like a hundred years!  The king is so sad about Rama leaving that he's died!  Rama and Lakshmana have gone to the forest.  Bharata and Shatrughna are with their grandfather. We need a new king from the Ikshvaku family, or our kingdom will be in trouble!

Without a king, things get awful. People won't plant food.  Families will fight.  Wives won't listen to their husbands.  Thieves will take everything.  Women will do bad things.  Nobody will go to temples or parties.  Wise men won't give blessings.  Actors won't perform.  Beautiful girls won't dance in the gardens.  Rich people won't be safe.  Soldiers won't have a leader.  Nobody will be happy!

A kingdom without a king is like a river without water, a forest without trees, or a cow without a farmer.  The king is like a light – he’s gone, and everything is dark.  Without a king, people will fight and hurt each other.

Vasishtha, please help us! We need a new king from the Ikshvaku family to keep our kingdom safe!"
