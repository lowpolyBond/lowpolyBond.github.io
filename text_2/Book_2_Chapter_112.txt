Once upon a time, there were two amazing princes, Rama and Bharata.  Wise men were very impressed with them! They said, "What a lucky king to have such good sons!"

Some other wise men wanted King Ravana, a bad guy, to be defeated.  They went to Bharata and said, "Bharata, you're a prince!  Remember your family. Don't ignore what Rama says.  Your father is in heaven now, and this will help him."

The wise men went home. Rama said, "Thank you for helping me do what is right."

Bharata was worried. He said to Rama, "Rama, you're the oldest and the best leader.  You should be king! Everyone wants you. I'm not brave enough to rule the whole kingdom."

Bharata begged Rama to be king.  He said it over and over again!

Rama hugged Bharata.  He said, "Your kindness will make you a good ruler.  Ask for advice, but I can't break my promise.  It doesn't matter if your mother wanted you to be king because she loves you or because she's ambitious."

Bharata gave Rama his golden sandals.  He said, "These will represent you, the king, while you're gone.  For fourteen years, I'll live simply, waiting for your return. If you're not back, I'll throw myself into a fire!"

Rama hugged Bharata and said, "Okay." He added, "Be kind to your mother, Kaikeyi, and don't be angry with her."  Rama sadly said goodbye to Bharata and his brother Shatrughna.

Bharata put the sandals on a big elephant. Rama bowed to his teachers, friends, and family, and went home. His mothers were too sad to say anything.  Rama went to his house, feeling very sad.
