Once upon a time, Rama, a very brave prince, met a man named Shambuka. Shambuka was doing a very hard prayer. He wanted to become a god.  He told Rama, "I'm a Shudra, and I'm not lying, I want to go to heaven!"

Rama listened. Then, *whoosh*! Rama used his shiny sword and cut off Shambuka's head.  The gods shouted, "Good job, Rama!"  Flowers rained down from the sky.

The gods were happy. They said to Rama, "You did a good thing! Ask for anything you want!"

Rama was kind. He said, "A little boy died because of me. Please bring him back to life!" The gods did it! The little boy lived again.

The gods then invited Rama to visit a wise, old hermit named Agastya.  They all flew in their magic chariots.  Rama flew in a beautiful, golden chariot called Pushpaka.

At Agastya's home, the gods said goodbye and left. Rama bowed to Agastya, who was very happy to see him.

Agastya gave Rama a beautiful, glowing jewel.  He said, “This is a gift from the gods for helping them.”

Rama was a good prince. He knew it wasn't right for a warrior to accept gifts from a wise man.  Agastya explained that Rama had special powers because a long, long time ago, the gods shared some of their powers to create the very first king. Rama was like that king! He had the power of the gods!

Rama understood. He happily took the jewel. He asked Agastya where the jewel came from. Agastya told Rama a long story about how he got it, a story from a very long time ago. And that's how Rama got a magical jewel!
