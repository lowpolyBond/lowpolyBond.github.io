Rama was very, very sad.  He missed his wife, Sita.  He felt terrible because Sita was gone, and he felt bad that he had caused his brother, Lakshmana, worry too.  Rama was so sad he couldn’t stop crying.

He said to Lakshmana, “I’m the unluckiest person in the world!  Bad things keep happening to me. Maybe I did bad things a long time ago, and now I’m paying for them. I lost my kingdom. I’m away from my family and my mom. And now Sita is gone!  I miss her so much. It feels like my heart is breaking.”

Rama remembered how beautiful Sita was.  He pictured her, her skin like the color of saffron, maybe now dirty with blood and dust. He imagined a giant, a mean rakshasa, taking her away. He thought of her sweet voice, now maybe filled with scared cries.  He imagined her beautiful hair and her pretty eyes, now dull and sad.  He worried that the giant might have hurt her.

Rama wondered where Sita could be.  Maybe she was walking by the beautiful Godavari River, but Sita never went anywhere alone. Maybe she was picking flowers, but she was too scared to go alone.  Maybe she went into the forest, but she was too shy for that!

Rama asked the sun, “Sun, you see everything.  Did Sita wander off, or was she taken away?” He asked the wind, “Wind, you know everything.  Where is Sita? Is she lost?  Is she hurt? Is she… gone?”

Rama cried and cried.  Lakshmana felt sad too, but he tried to be brave.  He told Rama, “Brother, don’t give up! We need to find Sita!  Strong people don’t let sadness win.”

But Rama was too sad to listen. He just kept crying, missing Sita terribly.
