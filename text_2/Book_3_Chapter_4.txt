Rama and his brother Lakshmana were walking in the forest.  Suddenly, a HUGE scary demon grabbed them!

Sita, Rama's wife, was very scared.  She cried, "Oh, please take me instead!  Spare Rama and Lakshmana!"

Rama and Lakshmana were strong and brave. They fought the demon! Lakshmana broke one of the demon's arms, and Rama broke the other.  The demon fell down, like a tree hit by lightning!

They punched and kicked him, and shot him with arrows, but he wouldn't die! He was too strong!

Rama said, "Lakshmana, this demon can't be killed with weapons. Let's dig a big hole and bury him!"

Lakshmana dug a deep pit.  Before Rama buried him, the demon spoke.  "I'm not really a demon," he said.  "I'm Tumburu, a magical being. A curse turned me into this monster.  Only Rama can break the curse!"

Tumburu told Rama to visit a wise man named Sharabhanga. He lived a little ways away. Sharabhanga would help them. Then, Tumburu went to heaven.

Rama and Lakshmana buried the demon.  They were happy they had helped Tumburu and were ready to continue their journey.  They felt like the sun and moon shining brightly in the sky!
