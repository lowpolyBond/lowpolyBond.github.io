Rama and his brother Lakshmana were very sad.  They walked to a beautiful lake called Pampa.  The lake was full of pretty lotus flowers and tall trees.  Rama loved the lake, but he was still very sad.

"Lakshmana," Rama said, "look at this amazing place!  It's so beautiful! But I miss Sita so much.  And Bharata is so upset."

The lake was full of wonderful things.  There were lots of flowers, birds singing, and even playful monkeys and deer.  The trees were covered in blossoms, and the breeze smelled sweet.

Rama sighed. "Lakshmana, this beautiful spring makes me miss Sita even more.  The birds singing about love, the flowers blooming...it all reminds me of her."  He remembered how happy Sita was when they heard the cuckoo bird sing together.

He saw peacocks dancing, and it made him sadder. "Even the peacocks are happy with their mates," he said, "but I'm all alone."  He felt terrible that Sita was gone.

He thought about Sita's gentle smile, her beautiful eyes, and her sweet voice. He worried about her.  "Will she be alright without me?" he wondered.  The beautiful spring, which he used to love so much with Sita, now only made him feel worse.

Lakshmana tried to comfort Rama.  "Rama," he said, "don't be so sad. We will find Sita! We have to be strong."  He reminded Rama that giving up wasn't an option. They had to find Sita.

Rama listened to Lakshmana. He took a deep breath and wiped away his tears.  He knew Lakshmana was right.  They had to be brave.

Rama and Lakshmana continued their journey.  They were determined to find Sita, even though it was hard.  Along the way, they saw some monkeys hiding in fear.  They were scared of the brave Rama and Lakshmana, but that was a story for another day.
