Once upon a time, the gods heard that the powerful king Ravana had been captured.  Ravana was so strong, he was like the wind itself! His grandfather, Paulastya, was very sad. He loved Ravana very much.

Paulastya was super fast, like the wind!  He zoomed to the city of Mahishmati to see King Arjuna, the brave warrior who had captured Ravana.  The city was beautiful and happy.  Everyone was amazed to see Paulastya. They told King Arjuna right away.

Arjuna was very respectful. He bowed to Paulastya and gave him wonderful gifts, just like a king should. He offered him delicious food and drink, a beautiful cow, and water to wash his feet.  Arjuna was so happy to see such a powerful and holy man. He said, "My city is honored by your visit! Tell me, what can I do for you?"

Paulastya asked Arjuna how he was doing and asked him to free Ravana. He said, "Arjuna, you are the strongest! You defeated my grandson, Ravana, who was so powerful that even the ocean and wind were afraid of him. But, please, release him."

Arjuna listened carefully. He was a kind king. He let Ravana go! He even gave Ravana beautiful jewels, flowers, and amazing clothes. They even became friends!

Then Paulastya went home, but Ravana, feeling a little ashamed, went off to explore the world. He still thought he was super strong and he acted very proud.

This is a story about how even the mightiest warriors can be kind and generous. It also shows that even if you're very strong, there are always others who may be stronger still.  And it's important to be kind to everyone, even your enemies!
