Rama and Ravana fought a HUGE battle!  Their chariots crashed and bumped, making everyone scared.  Giant monkeys and other strong warriors watched. They were so amazed, they forgot to fight each other!  They just watched Rama and Ravana.

Rama and Ravana were super angry.  Ravana thought, "I will win!" Rama thought, "I must win!"  They both fought with all their might.

Ravana shot many arrows at Rama's chariot flag.  But the arrows missed! Then Rama shot a super-shiny arrow.  *WHOOSH!* It hit Ravana’s flag and knocked it down!

Ravana got REALLY mad! He threw EVERYTHING at Rama:  arrows, maces, clubs, even trees! He used magic to make more weapons.  It was a storm of weapons!  But he couldn't hit Rama’s chariot.  The weapons hit the monkey army instead!

Rama smiled a little.  He shot hundreds and thousands of arrows back! The sky was filled with arrows flying everywhere!  They crashed into each other and fell to the ground.

Rama and Ravana kept fighting and fighting.  They shot arrows at each other’s horses.  It was a super amazing, scary, and exciting battle!  Ravana was furious that his flag was broken.  The battle went on and on…
