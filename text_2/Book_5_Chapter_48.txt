Once upon a time, a strong monkey named Hanuman fought bravely against the evil king Ravana.  Hanuman was so strong, he even defeated Ravana's son, Aksha!

Ravana was furious. He called his own son, Indrajit, a super-strong warrior. Ravana said, "Indrajit, you are the best warrior! You've even fought gods and demons! You're unbeatable! Go fight Hanuman and stop him!"

Indrajit, who was as brave as a lion, listened to his father. He got into his chariot, pulled by four white lions.  The chariot wheels rumbled, and Indrajit's bow twanged like thunder.

Hanuman was excited for the fight!  When he saw Indrajit's chariot, he roared and grew even bigger!  The two warriors fought! Indrajit shot amazing arrows, fast as lightning!  Hanuman jumped and dodged them all. He was too quick!

Indrajit couldn't hurt Hanuman.  He was a very clever warrior, so he used a special magic weapon given to him by a powerful god.  This weapon wasn't meant to hurt, it just tied Hanuman up!

Hanuman was tied up tight, but he didn't feel any pain. He knew this was part of a plan. He remembered a special blessing from another god. He knew he was meant to be captured.

The other demons tied Hanuman up with ropes. The magic weapon no longer worked because he was tied with ropes too!  Indrajit felt sad because his special arrow didn't work properly.  He knew his plan wasn't perfect.

Hanuman didn't show that he was free from the magic. He let the demons drag him to Ravana's palace.

When they got to the palace, Ravana, the ten-headed king, saw Hanuman.  Ravana's advisors asked Hanuman, "Who are you? Why are you here?"

Hanuman answered, "I'm a messenger from King Sugriva."  And so, the story continues...
