Rama asked Sugriva, "How do you know so much about the whole world?"

Sugriva bowed and said, "I'll tell you!  My brother Bali fought a giant buffalo.  Bali followed the buffalo into a mountain cave. I waited outside, but Bali didn't come out for a whole year!  Then, blood poured from the cave.  I thought Bali was dead. I was so sad! I put a HUGE rock at the cave's entrance to stop the buffalo from escaping.  Then I went home."

"I became king. I lived happily with my friends. But then, Bali came back! He was alive! I was scared and gave him back his kingdom.  But Bali was mean! He wanted to kill me!  I ran away with my friends."

"Bali chased me everywhere! I ran past rivers, forests, and cities.  The world zoomed by so fast! I saw amazing things: tall mountains, sparkling lakes, and beautiful forests.  I even saw a mountain with lots of gold and a big, white ocean!"

"I ran east, then south, then west.  Bali kept chasing me!  Finally, my clever friend Hanuman helped me hide.  We found a safe place where Bali couldn't follow. That's how I saw so much of the world!"
