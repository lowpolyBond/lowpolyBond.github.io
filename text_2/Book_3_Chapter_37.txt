Once upon a time, a powerful king named Ravana listened to some bad advice.  A clever monkey named Marica warned him, "King Ravana, it's easy to find people who will flatter you, but hard to find those who tell the truth, even if it's hard to hear."

Marica said, "You don't know Rama! He's incredibly strong and brave. Your spies are wrong.  Rama is so powerful, he could defeat all of you!  Stealing Sita, Rama's wife, will bring terrible trouble.  It will destroy your kingdom, Lanka!"

Marica explained, "Rama is a good and kind king. He's honest, brave, and loyal. He went to the forest because he had to, not because he wanted to.  The stories you heard about him are lies!"

"Sita is very loyal and pure," Marica continued. "She's like the sun, shining brightly for Rama.  Trying to take her will be like playing with fire. Rama is a great warrior. He'll fight you fiercely! He's strong like a lion!"

Marica warned, "Ravana, if you fight Rama, you will lose everything â€“ your kingdom, your happiness, even your life!  It's better to listen to good advice. Think carefully about what you're doing before you cause a huge war."  Marica said, "Please, don't fight Rama! It's not worth it!"
