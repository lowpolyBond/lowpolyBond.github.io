Hanuman, the strong monkey, flew back to Lanka.  He was given special permission by Vibhishana, Ravana's good brother, to enter the city. Hanuman knew Sita was in the Ashok Grove.

He found Sita sitting sadly under a tree.  She looked very unhappy.  Some mean women were around her.  Hanuman bowed politely to Sita.

Sita was surprised to see him.  Then she smiled, happy to see a friend. Hanuman told her great news!

"Rama is okay!" Hanuman said. "Lakshmana and Sugriva are fine too! Rama won the war! He killed Ravana!  Vibhishana helped him.  Rama is coming to get you!"

Sita was so happy she couldn't speak!  Hanuman asked, "What are you thinking?"

Sita finally spoke, her voice shaky with joy, "I'm so happy! I don't know how to thank you!"

Hanuman smiled. "You make Rama proud. That's the best thank you!"

Then Sita said, "Those mean women were so awful to me. Can you punish them?"

Hanuman said, "Of course! I can beat them up!"

But Sita stopped him. "No," she said.  "They were just following Ravana's orders.  It's better to be kind, even to bad people.  It's what Rama would do."

Hanuman agreed.  He asked Sita, "May I go tell Rama you are ready to see him?"

Sita said, "Yes! I want to see my husband!"

Hanuman quickly flew back to Rama. He told Rama everything Sita said.  Soon, Sita would see Rama again!
