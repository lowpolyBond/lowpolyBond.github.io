The mighty King of Lanka was very upset.  Hanuman, a strong monkey, had just wrecked his city!  Hanuman, who was super strong, had even met Sita, the princess Rama wanted to save.  He smashed palaces and defeated the King's best fighters.  The King was scared.

He called his advisors together.  "What should we do?" he asked. "Hanuman, a monkey, has destroyed our city! Rama and his monkey army are coming to fight us! He's super strong, he might even dry up the ocean!"

The King explained there are three kinds of people:

* **Smart people:** They talk to their friends, family, and wise advisors before making a plan. They ask for help from God, too!
* **Okay people:** They make plans by themselves.
* **Not-so-smart people:** They don't think things through and don't ask for help. They just say, "I'll do it!" and often fail.

The King said there are three kinds of advice, too: good, okay, and bad. Good advice is when everyone agrees after thinking carefully. Okay advice comes after lots of talking. Bad advice is when everyone argues and doesn't agree.

"You are all very smart," the King told his advisors. "Rama is coming!  Think of a plan to save Lanka!"
