Once upon a time, a brave monkey named Hanuman met Sita, a beautiful princess held captive by a mean king named Ravana.  Sita was very sad and missed her husband, Rama, very much.

Hanuman said, "Don't worry, Princess Sita! I'll tell Rama you're here!"

Sita explained, "Rama will remember the special jewel I wear on my forehead.  He also remembers how he drew a mark on my cheek once. Tell him I'm suffering terribly and that I won't live much longer without him!  Please hurry!"

Hanuman promised, "I'll go right away!  Rama and his brother Lakshmana are very sad too.  They'll come to rescue you, and they'll defeat Ravana!"

Sita gave Hanuman the special jewel. "This will show Rama it's really me," she said.

Hanuman, strong and brave, got ready to jump.  Sita cried, "Please tell Rama and Lakshmana, and their friend Sugriva, that I miss them! Tell them how badly I'm treated here!"

Hanuman promised to deliver Sita's message and zoomed off to find Rama, his heart full of hope. He already felt like he was on his way!
