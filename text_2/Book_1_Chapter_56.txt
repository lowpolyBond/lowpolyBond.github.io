Vishvamitra was angry. He shouted at Vasishtha and aimed a fiery weapon!  "Stop!" cried Vasishtha.

Vasishtha raised his magical staff.  "You're no match for me!" he said.  "I'll take all your weapons!"

Vishvamitra threw lots and lots of powerful weapons!  He threw fire weapons, water weapons, even weapons from the gods!  But Vasishtha was super strong.  He used his staff to stop every single one!  It was like magic!

Then Vishvamitra threw his most powerful weapon â€“ the Brahman-astra!  Everyone got scared!  The whole world shook!  But Vasishtha was even stronger than that.  He used his special powers to stop it, too! Light shone from him as he did it. His staff glowed like fire!

All the other wise people cheered for Vasishtha. "You're amazing!" they said.  "You showed Vishvamitra that spiritual power is the strongest power."

Vishvamitra was sad. He knew he was beaten.  "Being strong with weapons isn't everything," he sighed. "Spiritual power is much greater! I'll become a wise person, too!"  And he did.
