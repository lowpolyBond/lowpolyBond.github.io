Rama took Sita to a beautiful place.  He showed her the Mandakini River.  It was a sparkling river, flowing down from the mountains.

"Look, Sita!" Rama said.  "See the pretty swans and cranes!  The riverbanks are full of flowers. It's even prettier than the river near Kuvera's palace!"

The water was a little muddy. Deer had been drinking there.  Some people who lived simply, wearing clothes made of tree bark and animal skin, were bathing in the river.  Others were praying to the sun.

The wind made the trees sway. It looked like the mountains were dancing!  The wind blew flowers off the trees. It looked like the mountain was giving flowers to the river!

"See the pretty flowers, Sita!" Rama said. "And the geese playing in the water!  This place is even better than Ayodhya!"

Rama wanted to bathe in the river with Sita.  "Let's play in the water, Sita!" he said.  "Let's pretend these people are from Ayodhya, and this river is the Sarayu River."

Rama and Sita played happily. They threw flowers at each other.  They splashed each other with water.

"I'm so happy here with you, Sita," Rama said.  "And with Lakshmana.  I don't even miss Ayodhya!  We have honey, fruits, and berries to eat.  Elephants, lions, and monkeys come here to drink. There are always flowers!"

Rama and Sita walked happily through the beautiful Cittrakuta mountain, hand in hand.
