Once upon a time, the Monkey King, Sugriva, told Rama, a brave prince,  "Rama, my strong monkey friends are ready to help you! They're super strong and fast, and they can travel anywhere!"

Sugriva explained, "Millions of monkeys from all over are here for you. They'll do whatever you ask.  I know what you want to do, but you're the boss. Tell us what to do."

Rama hugged Sugriva and said, "My dear friend, let's find Sita, Rama's wife, and Ravana's kingdom.  Once we find Sita, we'll decide what to do next. Sugriva, you’ll lead the search. You're brave and smart, and you know the best way to find her."

Then Sugriva told his best monkey general, Vinata,  "Vinata, take thousands of monkeys and search the east! Look everywhere for Sita, the princess, and Ravana's home. Search the mountains, forests, and rivers. Look near the Bhagirathi, Sarayu, Kaushiki, Kalindi, Yamuna, and the big rivers and mountains near them.

"Search in many different lands.  Look in places with silkworms and silver mines. Look in Mandara and near the sea. Search among strange people – some with one foot, some who eat meat, and others with golden skin.

Look on islands like Yava, Suvama, and Rupayaka, with lots of gold and silver.  Look on Mount Shishira, a tall mountain where gods and giants live. Look near the red Shona River. Look where the Siddhas and Caranas live. Look on scary islands in the ocean where big waves crash.

"Go past the ocean called Lohita, and find the Shamali tree, where demons hang from the rocks. Keep going to the Kshiroda Sea, and see the white mountain Rishabha. Then, go to the scary Jalada Sea.

"Next, look near the golden Jatarupashila mountain where the giant snake Ananta sleeps. Look for a golden palm tree. Keep going to Mount Udaya and Mount Saumanasa.  It is where the sun rises in Jambudvipa. Look for Sita and Ravana in these places!

"But go only so far. You can't go beyond the eastern lands. After a month, come back, no matter what! Whoever doesn't return will be in trouble."

Sugriva said, "Find Sita and Ravana’s home and then come back.  Be careful and good luck!"
