A big, important ceremony was happening.  Sage Valmiki's students, Kusha and Lava, were there.  They saw the amazing celebration!  Valmiki's friends built some cozy huts nearby.  Lots and lots of yummy food—fruits and roots—were brought in carts.

Valmiki told Kusha and Lava, "Sing the Ramayana!  Sing it everywhere! Sing it near the houses of the priests, along the roads, even at the king's tent where the ceremony is happening. Sing it at Rama's tent!"

He gave them delicious mountain fruits to eat. "These will keep your voices strong," he said. "If Rama wants you to sing to everyone, do it.  Sing twenty chapters each time. You already know them.  Don't worry about getting money. We don't need gold! If King Rama asks who taught you, say, 'We are students of Sage Valmiki!'"

Valmiki gave them special stringed instruments.  "Play them nicely," he said. "Sing the whole story from the beginning, be polite to the king. Sing tomorrow at sunrise!"

Kusha and Lava bowed.  "Yes, we will do as you say!" they promised.  They were excited!  They spent the night thinking about singing the Ramayana. They were ready to share the story.
