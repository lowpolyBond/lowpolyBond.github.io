Long ago, a powerful king named Danda ruled a beautiful city.  He was a good king, but one day, something changed.

It was springtime, and the flowers were blooming. Danda visited a wise hermit, a very holy man.  There, he saw the hermit's daughter, Aruja. She was so beautiful that Danda fell instantly in love.

He asked her, "Where do you come from, beautiful girl? Who is your father?" He was so smitten, he didn't think straight.

Aruja was kind but firm. "I am Shukracarya's daughter," she said. "My name is Aruja. Please, don't force yourself on me.  My father is your teacher! He will be very angry if you don't ask him for my hand in marriage first." She warned him, "If you don't, he'll be very, very angry â€“ he's so powerful!"

But Danda, caught up in his feelings, didn't listen. He ignored Aruja's warning and took her against her will.

Feeling very sad and scared, Aruja waited for her father.  Danda hurried back to his city, feeling guilty and ashamed.  He had done something very wrong.  Aruja waited, crying, for her powerful father to return.  He was a very holy man, and everyone was afraid of what he might do to Danda.
