Rama was walking, and suddenly his eye twitched! He felt shaky and scared.  He asked his brother Lakshmana, "Is everything alright with Sita?"

Rama really wanted to see Sita. He hurried to their home, but it was empty!  He was worried. He ran around and around, looking everywhere. Their little home felt sad and empty without Sita. It was like a pond without any pretty lotuses.

The trees looked sad, the flowers drooped, and even the birds and deer seemed unhappy.  Rama cried, "Where is Sita? Did someone take her? Did something bad happen to her? Maybe she's just gathering flowers or getting water!"

Rama searched and searched. He ran through the forest, climbed hills, and looked near the river. He was so tired and sad. He called out to the trees, "Kedumbra tree, have you seen Sita? Bilva tree, Arjuna tree, have you seen my Sita?" He asked every tree he could find â€“ the Ashoka, Tala, Jambu, and many more.

He even asked the animals! "Deer, elephant, tiger," he cried, "have you seen Sita?"

Rama called out, "Sita!  Where are you? Don't hide! Please come back!" He thought he saw her, but it wasn't her.  He felt heartbroken. He thought maybe Sita was gone.  He was so sad!  He cried, "My beautiful Sita, where are you?"

Rama searched and searched. He ran through the forest all day and night, looking for Sita. He was so tired, but he wouldn't stop. He just wanted to find his beloved wife.
