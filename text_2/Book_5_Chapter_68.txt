Once upon a time, a beautiful princess named Sita was trapped on a faraway island called Lanka.  A brave monkey named Hanuman found her.  Sita was very sad, but she was happy to see him.

Sita told Hanuman, "Please tell Prince Rama, the strongest and kindest man, to come save me!  I miss him so much. Please tell him to defeat the evil king Ravana who keeps me prisoner.  It would be wonderful if Rama could rescue me with his army.  It wouldn't be right for him to just sneak me away like Ravana did."

She worried, "How will Rama and his friends even get here?  The ocean is so big! Only a few super-strong creatures can fly or swim across it."  Sita was very scared and sad. She was happy to see Hanuman, but still very worried.

Hanuman said, "Don't worry, Sita!  Rama's best friend, Sugriva, leads a huge army of monkeys! They are super strong and fast. Some can even fly! They've traveled all over the world.  They're even stronger than me! They will definitely get you across the ocean."

He promised, "Soon, you'll see Prince Rama and his brother Lakshmana.  They are like the sun and moon, brave and strong.  You'll hear the mighty monkeys roar as they get closer. Theyâ€™ll defeat the evil king and bring you home to Ayodhya!"

Sita felt much better after hearing Hanuman's promise.  She felt hope again and wasn't as sad.  She knew Rama would come to save her.
