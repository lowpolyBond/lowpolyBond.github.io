King Ravana was very angry.  His strong general, Mahaparshva, saw this. He said, "King, you're the strongest! You found something amazing (Sita).  Enjoy it!  Don't be afraid.  You're powerful! Even with Kumbhakarna and Indrajit on your side, who could beat you?  We can win with our strength!"

Ravana thanked him, but said, "I have a secret.  Long ago, I was mean to a beautiful nymph.  The gods punished me! If I hurt another woman, my head will explode! That's why I haven't forced Sita. But Rama doesn't know how strong I am. He’s like a man going near a sleeping lion! He hasn't seen my amazing arrows! They're like fast snakes! I'll defeat him easily.  My arrows are like lightning!  I’ll wipe out his army.  I'm stronger than even the gods! I even won a big battle before!"
