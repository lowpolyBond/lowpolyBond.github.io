Once upon a time, there was a powerful monkey king named Bali.  He was the older brother of Sugriva, and everyone loved him.  Bali was a very strong and brave monkey.

One day, Mayavi, a giant, got angry at Bali. Mayavi challenged Bali to a fight! Bali, very angry, went to fight Mayavi, even though his wives and Sugriva begged him not to. Sugriva followed his brother.

Mayavi was scared and ran away.  He ran and ran until he found a big hole in the ground and hid inside!  Bali followed him into the hole.

Before going in, Bali told Sugriva, "Stay here and guard the entrance while I fight Mayavi!"  Sugriva waited.  He waited and waited.  A whole year went by!

Sugriva heard roaring and saw blood coming from the hole. He thought Bali was dead.  Very sad, Sugriva blocked the hole with a giant rock.  He thought his brother was gone forever.

Then, Sugriva became the new king.  But then, guess what? Bali came back! He had won the fight! He was furious to see Sugriva as king.  He was angry and scolded Sugriva.

Sugriva tried to be nice. He bowed down to Bali, but Bali was still very angry. He didn't forgive Sugriva.  That's how Sugriva became king, and how his relationship with his brother became very difficult.
