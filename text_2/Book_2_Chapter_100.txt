Rama saw his brother, Bharata, lying on the ground.  Bharata looked very thin and sad. His clothes were simple, like a monk's. He looked like the sun had fallen to Earth!

Rama gently took Bharata's hands. He helped him up, kissed his head, and hugged him tight.  "Bharata," Rama asked softly, "where is Father? Why are you here all alone in the forest?  You wouldn't be here without him!"

Rama was worried. Bharata looked so sick and tired.  He asked lots of questions:

"Is Father well? Is Mother Kaushalya okay?  And Mother Sumitra?  Is our kingdom safe? Are the priests and our friends well?"

Rama wanted to know everything! He asked if Bharata was treating everyone fairly.  Was he being kind to the people? Was he a good king? Was he wise and just?  He asked if Bharata was listening to good advice, and if he was working hard to keep the kingdom strong and happy. He asked if Bharata was kind to everyone, rich or poor.

Rama asked if Bharata was taking good care of the army, the people, and the city of Ayodhya. He asked if Ayodhya was a safe and happy place to live, full of food and good people. He asked if Bharata was kind and just to his subjects.

Rama wanted to make sure his brother was a good and wise king, ruling fairly and kindly. He explained how a good king should rule and what to look out for.  He wanted Bharata to be the best king he could be.

Finally, Rama said, "A good king who is kind and just will be loved by everyone and will go to heaven when he dies."
