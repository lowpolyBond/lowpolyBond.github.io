Hanuman and his friends were very hungry and tired. They found a dark cave and went inside to look for food.  Wow! Inside, everything was made of gold!  Golden trees, golden flowers, golden fruit!  There were even golden fish swimming in a golden pond!

Hanuman was amazed. "Who made all this?" he asked a wise woman who lived there.  She wore simple clothes made of tree bark.

The wise woman, whose name was Swayamprabha, smiled.  "A powerful magician named Maya built this amazing place," she explained. "He was a great builder for the giants, but he learned magic through years and years of hard work. He made this beautiful golden forest for himself and his friend Hema."

Swayamprabha told Hanuman that Maya had a wonderful life here, but then he died. After that, the gods gave this amazing golden forest to Hema. And now Swayamprabha helped take care of it.

"Why are you here?" Swayamprabha asked Hanuman.  "Eat some of the fruit and drink some water. Then tell me your story."
