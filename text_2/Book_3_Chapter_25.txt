Once upon a time, a mean demon named Khara and his army saw Rama, a brave warrior.  Khara was angry! He told his driver to rush towards Rama in his chariot.

Rama stood strong, his bow ready.  Khara and his army shouted and attacked Rama.  They were huge and strong, like mountains! They threw spears, swords, and clubs at Rama.  It looked like a storm of weapons!

Rama was surrounded, like the sun hidden behind clouds.  Even though he was hurt, Rama didn't give up.  He pulled back his bow.  Whoosh! Thousands of arrows flew, fast as lightning!

The arrows were so fast, they looked like bright lights in the air.  They hit the demons everywhere.  The arrows knocked down demons, chariots, elephants, and even horses! The demons screamed and fell to the ground.

Some demons tried to fight back.  They threw more weapons, but Rama was too quick! He cut off their heads with his arrows. They fell like trees blown down by a strong wind.

More demons ran away, but one brave demon, Dushana, fought back. He and his friends threw big rocks and tree trunks at Rama.  The battle raged! It was hard to tell who was winning.

Then Rama shouted loudly! He used a special magic arrow.  Whoosh! Thousands more arrows flew! They filled the sky, and the sun disappeared behind them.

Many, many demons died.  The ground was covered with bodies, broken weapons, and dead elephants and horses. The remaining demons were scared. They knew they couldn't beat Rama.  They ran away! Rama had won the great battle!
