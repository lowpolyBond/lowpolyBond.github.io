Rama, the brave prince, saw a HUGE giant! This giant was named Kumbhakarna. He was so big, he looked like a mountain!  He was scary, and all the monkey soldiers ran away!

Rama was surprised. He asked Bibishana, "Who is that giant? He's HUGE!"

Bibishana explained, "That's Kumbhakarna. He's super strong!  He's even defeated the gods before! He's so hungry, he eats thousands of creatures!"

Bibishana told Rama a story. When Kumbhakarna was a baby, he was so hungry he ate everything! Even the gods were scared of him!  The god Indra even tried to hit him with a thunderbolt, but Kumbhakarna was too strong!  

Finally, the great god Prajapati put a curse on Kumbhakarna. He said, "You will sleep for six months and only wake up for one day!"  But Ravana, the bad king, woke Kumbhakarna up to fight Rama's army.

Bibishana said to Rama, "Don't be afraid! Kumbhakarna is just here to scare you. He's like a big, scary toy!"

Rama told his monkey general, Nila, "Tell the monkeys to be brave!  Give them rocks and trees to fight with!"

The monkeys listened to Rama. They got ready to fight. They picked up big rocks and trees. They were strong and brave, and they weren't afraid anymore!  They charged towards Kumbhakarna, ready to fight the giant!
