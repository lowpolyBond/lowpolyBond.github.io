Once upon a time, during a big battle in the Ramayana, a powerful giant named Atikaya was very angry.  Many of his friends and family had been hurt.  He roared and climbed into his shiny chariot, which sparkled like a hundred suns!

He was so big and strong, the monkeys fighting for Rama were scared. They thought, "It's Kumbhakarna again!"  They hid!  Atikaya was huge, like a mountain.

Rama, the brave prince, saw Atikaya. He asked his friend Bibishana, "Who is that giant warrior?"

Bibishana explained, "That's Atikaya, the son of the ten-headed demon king, Ravana! He's super strong and brave,  a gift from the god Brahma. He's won many battles!"

Atikaya yelled and shot arrows at the monkeys.  Brave monkey leaders fought back, but Atikaya was too strong! He smashed trees and rocks.

Then Atikaya challenged anyone to fight him.  Lakshmana, Rama's brother, stepped forward.  He was brave, too!

Atikaya boasted, "You're just a child! My arrows are too powerful!"

But Lakshmana said, "Brave warriors show their strength in battle, not just words!"

They fought! Atikaya shot many arrows, but Lakshmana was quick and clever, breaking each one.  Then Lakshmana shot an arrow that hit Atikaya right on the forehead.

Atikaya was hurt, but still strong. He shot more arrows, but Lakshmana kept breaking them.  Finally, Lakshmana used a special, powerful arrow, a gift from the gods. This arrow cut off Atikaya's head!

Atikaya's friends were terrified and ran away. The monkeys cheered for Lakshmana.  They were so happy he had defeated the mighty giant!
