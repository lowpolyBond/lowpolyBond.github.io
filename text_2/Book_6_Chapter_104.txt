Rama was so angry, the whole world shook!  The ground trembled.  Even the mountains, where lions and tigers lived, shivered. Trees swayed back and forth. The ocean splashed and crashed.  Crows cawed loudly, circling in the sky.  Everyone was scared.  Even Ravana was worried.

Gods, magical creatures, and even scary demons watched Rama and Ravana fight.  They used powerful weapons. It looked like the end of the world! Some cheered for Rama, shouting, "Victory!" Others cheered for Ravana, shouting, "Win!"

Ravana, furious, grabbed a giant, diamond-hard spear. It was huge and scary, with points like mountain peaks! He held it high, like a blazing fire.  He yelled so loud, the whole world shook again!  He shouted to Rama, "This spear will kill you and your brother!"

Ravana threw the spear. It zoomed through the air, making a loud ringing sound.

Rama quickly shot his own arrows to stop it.  But the spear was too strong! It burned up Rama's arrows.  Rama got even angrier!

He grabbed his own special spear, a gift from the gods. It shone brightly in the sky!  He threw it at Ravana's spear, and *BAM!*  Ravana's spear broke!

Then Rama shot many arrows at Ravana's horses.  He hit Ravana himself with more arrows!  Ravana was hurt, bleeding, and covered in arrows. He was very angry, but tired.
