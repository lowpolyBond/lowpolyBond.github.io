King Dasaratha was very sad.  He sat on his throne with Queen Kaikeyi, looking pale.  Rama came in and bowed to his father and mother.

The king just whispered, "Rama," and cried.  Rama was scared. He saw his father was very, very upset, like the ocean during a big storm. Rama didn't know what was wrong. He wondered, "Why is my father so unhappy?"

Rama asked Kaikeyi, "Mother, have I done something wrong? My father used to be happy to see me.  Is he sick?  Is something wrong with Bharata or Shatrughna, or my other mothers?"  He said he didn't want to live if his father was unhappy.  He asked Kaikeyi to tell him what was wrong.

Kaikeyi, who wanted something selfish, said, "The king loves you, but he can't tell you what's wrong. You just need to do what he promised me a long time ago."  She wouldn't say what it was, but said Rama should do whatever the king asked, then she would explain.

Rama said, "I'll do anything my father asks! I'll even jump into fire or drink poison!" He promised to obey.

Kaikeyi finally told him the truth.  Long ago, she saved the king in a battle. He promised her two wishes.  She wished for Bharata to become king, and for Rama to go live in the Dandaka forest for fourteen years!

Rama didn't show he was upset, but the king felt terrible.  He knew his son would suffer.
