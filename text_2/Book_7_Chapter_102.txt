Rama heard some good news! He was very happy.  He told his brothers, "Angada and Candraketu, the sons of my dear brother Lakshmana, are strong and brave! They will be kings!"

Rama said, "Let's find them a safe and wonderful place to rule, far away from any danger. A place with lots of nice places for holy people to live."

Bharata, Rama's brother, said, "I know the perfect place! It's called Karupatta. We can build two beautiful cities there!"

Rama agreed.  He made Karupatta part of his kingdom. He built a strong, amazing city for Angada, called Angadiya.  He also helped build a super cool city for Candraketu, called Candrakanta, in a land called the Mallas.  Candrakanta was so beautiful, it looked like a city in heaven!

Rama, Lakshmana, and Bharata helped Angada and Candraketu become kings. They divided the land between them.  Shatrughna, Lakshmana's son, helped Angada. Lakshmana and Bharata helped Candraketu.

Lakshmana stayed with Angada for one year, then went back home. Bharata stayed with Candraketu for another year before returning home.

Bharata and Lakshmana loved Rama so much.  They were busy helping him rule, and time flew by!  Ten thousand years passed, and they were all very happy together in their wonderful kingdom.  They lived like three bright, warm fires, shining with happiness and goodness.
