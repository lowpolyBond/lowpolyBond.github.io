Long ago, in the kingdom of Ayodhya, lived a wise man named Valmiki.  He wrote a very long and beautiful story about Rama, a brave king.

It was a really, really long story!  Valmiki wrote thousands of verses,  like a super long poem. He wondered, "Who will hear this amazing story?"

Then, two boys, Kusha and Lava, came to Valmiki. They were Rama's sons! They were very good and loved to sing.  Valmiki taught them the whole story.

The story was about Rama, his wife Sita, and how he fought a bad king named Ravana. It was full of exciting adventures, happy times, sad times, and everything in between!  The story showed how to be brave, kind, and strong.

Kusha and Lava had beautiful voices. They sang Valmiki’s story so beautifully, everyone loved it! They sang it to many wise people.

One day, they sang the story to King Rama and all his friends. Everyone cried happy tears!  They gave Kusha and Lava lots of gifts – fruits, clothes, and even special tools!

They said, "This story will teach everyone good things!  It will help people be happy and healthy!"

King Rama heard them singing. He was so happy! He invited Kusha and Lava to his palace.  He listened to their wonderful singing.

Rama loved the story. He was proud that his sons knew it so well. Kusha and Lava sang and sang, and everyone listened happily ever after.  And that’s how the story of Ramayana spread throughout the land!
