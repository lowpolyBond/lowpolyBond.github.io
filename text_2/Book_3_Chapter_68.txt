Rama and his brother Lakshmana found a giant bird, Jatayu, badly hurt.  Poor Jatayu had fought Ravana, a mean giant, to try and save Sita, Rama's wife.

Rama was very sad.  He asked Jatayu, "Can you tell me what happened to Sita? Where did Ravana take her?"

Jatayu, weak and bleeding, whispered, "Ravana, a wicked giant, stole Sita. He cut my wings! He flew south with her."  Jatayu was too hurt to say more before he died.

Rama was heartbroken.  He built a funeral pyre for Jatayu, a big fire to honor the brave bird. He even offered deer meat to Jatayuâ€™s spirit.  He and Lakshmana performed a special ceremony, like a prayer, for Jatayu.  Then, they went to find Sita.  They knew they had to rescue her from the terrible Ravana!
