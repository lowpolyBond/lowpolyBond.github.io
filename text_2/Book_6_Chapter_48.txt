Once upon a time, brave Rama and his strong brother Lakshmana were hurt in a battle.  Sita, Rama's kind wife, was very sad.  She cried, "People said I'd have sons and never be a widow! But Rama is hurt! They lied!"

She remembered what fortune-tellers had said about her. They said she'd be happy and honored.  "They lied too!" she cried.  Sita looked at her own beautiful hands and feet.  She had special marks that meant good luck. "But now, what good are they?" she sobbed.

Sita was very upset.  "Rama and Lakshmana, my heroes, are hurt! They had amazing magic weapons, but an enemy hurt them.  How could this happen?" she wailed. She worried most about her mother-in-law, Kaushalya. Kaushalya was waiting for Rama and Lakshmana to come home.

Just then, Trijata, a kind giantess, comforted Sita.  "Don't worry!" Trijata said. "I think Rama and Lakshmana are still alive! The soldiers aren't scared, and the magic flying chariot brought you here safely.  If Rama and Lakshmana were really dead, everyone would be very upset and scared. Rama and Lakshmana are too strong to be defeated!"

Trijata pointed out that Rama and Lakshmana still looked beautiful, even though they were hurt.  "People who are truly dead don't look so good," she explained.

Sita, feeling a little bit better, said, "I hope you're right!"

The magic chariot took Sita back to the city.  But even though Trijata had given her hope, Sita still missed Rama and Lakshmana very much. She went to a beautiful garden and thought about them, feeling sad again.
