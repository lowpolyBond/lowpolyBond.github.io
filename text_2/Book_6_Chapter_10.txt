Bibishana, a very brave and clever prince, went to his brother Ravana's palace.  It was a HUGE palace!  It was shiny and gold, like a giant mountain made of jewels.  Beautiful girls chattered in the hallways, and elephants trumpeted loudly.

Inside, Bibishana saw priests praying for Ravana's victory.  He bowed to Ravana, who sat on a golden throne.  Then Bibishana spoke quietly to Ravana and his ministers.

"Brother," he said, "bad things are happening!  The fire for our prayers is smoky and weak.  Animals are acting strangely. Cows have no milk, elephants are sick, and even donkeys are crying!  Crows are cawing, vultures are circling, and jackals are howling. These are bad omens!"

Bibishana explained, "These bad signs mean you should return Sita to Rama.  Everyone knows it's wrong to keep her."  He knew Ravana might be angry, but he had to speak the truth.

Ravana was furious! "Nonsense!" he roared.  "Rama will NEVER get Sita back!  Even if the gods themselves helped Rama, I would still win!"

Ravana was very, very strong, and he was very angry. He sent Bibishana away.  He refused to listen to his good advice.
