Sita disappeared into the ground!  All the monkeys and wise men shouted, "Hooray!" But Rama was very, very sad.  He leaned on his walking stick, his eyes filled with tears. He was heartbroken.

Rama cried and cried. He was angry too. He said, "My Sita is gone!  She's like a shining light, and now she's vanished! I found her from a faraway island, and I'll find her again! Earth Goddess, give Sita back! You're my mother-in-law, you know! I'll be so angry if you don't!"  He promised to shake the whole earth if Sita didn't return.

Then, Brahma, the great god, came.  He said, "Rama, don't be angry!  Remember who you are! You're a powerful god! Sita is safe. She's with the snake people, because she is so good. You'll see her again in heaven!"

Brahma told Rama a wonderful story, the whole story of Rama's life, from his birth until the future.  He said only Rama could hear this final part of the story.

Rama listened carefully. Then, he said to Valmiki, the man who was telling the story, "The wise men want to hear the rest of the story tomorrow!"  Rama went home with his sons, Kusha and Lava, and stayed with Valmiki. He spent the night missing Sita very much.
