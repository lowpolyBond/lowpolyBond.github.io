Ravana, a powerful king, was very handsome.  He wore fancy clothes and sparkly jewels.  When Sita, a beautiful princess, saw him, she was scared! She hid her face and body.

Sita was surrounded by Ravana's mean guards. She felt sad and lost, like a boat sinking in the ocean.  She sat on the hard ground, all alone.  She used to wear pretty clothes and jewelry, but now her clothes were dirty.  She looked like a muddy lotus flower.

Sita missed Rama, her husband.  She thought of him all the time.  She was very sad and thin. She cried a lot. She felt like a lost bird, all alone and afraid. She felt as sad as a flower without water, or a moon hidden by clouds.  She missed her family and her home. She was heartbroken.

Sita was so sad and weak.  She looked like a dry riverbed. Her hair was messy, like a jungle after the rain. She was hungry and scared, but she still prayed to Rama to help her.

Ravana saw Sita, and he tried to make her like him.  But this was a very bad decision for Ravana!
