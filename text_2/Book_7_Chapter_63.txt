Rama told Shatrughna he should be king, even though he was the youngest brother.  Shatrughna was surprised.  He said, "But my older brothers are still alive!  It doesn't seem right."

He felt nervous.  He remembered saying he would fight Lavana, a scary demon.  Shatrughna worried he had spoken out of turn. He promised to obey Rama, his older brother.  He said, "I will do what you say, my king."

Rama was happy. He told Bharata and Lakshmana to get everything ready for Shatrughna's coronation ceremony.  The priests and people of the city came.  Soon, Shatrughna became king! Everyone cheered.  His mother and the other queens were very happy.

Even the wise men living by the Yamuna River knew this was important. They said Lavana, the demon, would soon die.

Rama hugged his new king brother, Shatrughna. He gave Shatrughna a special magic arrow.  "This arrow will help you defeat Lavana," Rama said.  "This arrow is very powerful.  It was made by Lord Brahma a long time ago.  I didn't use it against Ravana because it's too powerful, and it would have caused too much destruction.  Lavana keeps his own powerful weapon at home.  You must fight him when he is away from his weapon.  Only then will you be able to win!"

Rama explained a clever plan to defeat Lavana.  He told Shatrughna to wait at the entrance to Lavana's city, and challenge him to a fight while Lavana's powerful weapon is still at home.  If Shatrughna waited for Lavana to return with his special weapon, he wouldnâ€™t win!
