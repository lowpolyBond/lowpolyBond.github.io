Hanuman told Rama and Sugriva all about his amazing trip to Lanka!  Rama was so happy. He said, "Hanuman, you did something incredible!  Only a few super-strong beings like the wind god and Garuda could have flown across that huge ocean.  No one else, not even gods or demons, could get into Lanka! Ravana is too powerful.  You are so brave and strong! Youâ€™re the best!"

Rama hugged Hanuman tight. He was so happy to hear Sita was safe.  But then Rama felt sad.  He said, "I'm happy Sita is found, but how will our monkey army ever cross that giant ocean to get to her?"  He worried about how to get everyone to Lanka to rescue Sita. He thought and thought, wondering what to do next.
