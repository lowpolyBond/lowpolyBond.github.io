Once upon a time, the monkey chiefs were talking about how far they could jump.  Gaya boasted, "I can jump a hundred miles!" Gavaksha shouted, "I can jump two hundred!" Sharabha said, "I can jump three hundred!"  Rishabha jumped in, "I can jump four hundred!" Gandhamadana said, "Five hundred miles for me!" Mainda bragged, "Six hundred!" And Dvivida said, "Seven hundred is nothing for me!"  Even Sushena said, "I can jump eight hundred!"

Old Jambavan, the wisest monkey, spoke next.  He said, "I used to jump far, but I'm old now. I can only jump three hundred miles." He sighed, "I'm not as strong as I used to be!  When I was young, I was super strong. But now, three hundred miles is all I can do."

Angada, a brave monkey, bowed to Jambavan. He said, "I can easily jump four hundred miles, but can I jump back? I'm not sure!"

Jambavan said, "Angada, you're strong, but jumping eight hundred miles is too much.  You're our leader, like a queen who needs protection.  You're the most important part of our plan.  We need you safe and sound."

Angada said, "If none of us go, we'll all be in big trouble!  We have to obey our king, Sugriva. If we fail, we might die! We have no choice but to succeed."

Jambavan, very smart, said, "Don't worry! I know someone who can do it!" He called for Hanuman, a very special monkey who was sitting quietly nearby.
