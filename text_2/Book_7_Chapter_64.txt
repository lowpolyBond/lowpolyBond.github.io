Rama, the brave prince, talked to his brother Shatrughna.  He said, "Shatrughna, I'm sending you to fight a bad guy named Lavana!  I'm giving you a HUGE army: four thousand horses, two thousand chariots, and one hundred strong elephants!  Plus, lots of gold, silver, food, and singers and dancers to keep everyone happy!"

Rama gave Shatrughna lots of advice.  "Make sure your soldiers are happy and well-fed," he said. "Lavana is very strong.  You need to sneak up on him. He can't know you're coming to fight him!  If he sees you coming, he'll defeat you. The rainy season is coming soon. Go now, and defeat Lavana before the rains begin!"

Rama also said, "Take your army across the Jahnavi river.  Set up camp, and then you, Shatrughna, go ahead with your bow and arrow.  Find a good spot and set up camp quietly."

Shatrughna listened carefully.  He bowed to Rama, Bharata, Lakshmana, and their wise priest, Vasishtha.  Then, he said goodbye to Rama and went to fight Lavana.  He led his huge army, with all the elephants and horses, on his important mission.
