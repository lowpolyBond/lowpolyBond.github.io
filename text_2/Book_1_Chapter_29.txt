Once upon a time, a wise man named Vishvamitra showed Rama, a brave prince, a special forest.  "Rama," he said, "this is Siddha-Ashrama.  A long, long time ago, God Vishnu lived here!  He was a tiny boy then, named Vamana."

Vishvamitra explained that a bad king, Bali, was very powerful.  He even beat the gods! The gods were scared.  They asked Vishnu for help.  So, Vishnu became Vamana, a little boy, to trick Bali.

Another wise man, Kashyapa, and his wife Aditi prayed to God Vishnu. They wished for Vishnu to be their son and help the gods.  Vishnu listened, and he was born as Vamana.

Vamana, looking like a poor boy, asked Bali for only three steps of land.  Bali agreed. But Vamana was magic!  With one step, he covered the whole Earth! With the second, he covered the sky!  And with the third, he pushed Bali far, far away.

Vishvamitra said, "This is Vamana's old home.  But now, bad monsters live here.  Rama, will you help me?"

Rama and his brother Lakshmana said, "Yes!"

They went into the beautiful forest.  Wise men living there were so happy to see Vishvamitra.  They welcomed Rama and Lakshmana.

Vishvamitra was going to do a special ceremony. Rama and Lakshmana helped him.  They stayed up all night, keeping watch. They prayed and got ready for the ceremony.  It was a very important day!
