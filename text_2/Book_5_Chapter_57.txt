Hanuman, strong and brave like a flying mountain, jumped across the ocean!  The ocean was magical – the clouds were like fluffy reeds, the sun was like a bird, and the moon was a shining flower.  He flew past the planets, zooming through colorful clouds that looked like rainbows. Sometimes he was hidden, sometimes he was seen – like the moon hiding behind clouds.

Hanuman roared like thunder! He fought bad guys, found Sita in Lanka, and was now flying back home.  He flew past Mount Mainaka, a giant mountain, and then flew past another big mountain, Mount Mahendra.  His roars were so loud they echoed everywhere!

He landed on the shore.  He waved his tail and shouted with joy! His friends heard him from far away.  They were so happy to see him back!  Jambavan, the wise old monkey, said, "Hanuman must have done great things! Only a hero would make so much noise!"

All the monkeys cheered! They ran and jumped, excited to see Hanuman.  He landed, a big, strong monkey, and everyone hugged him. They gave him fruits and made him a comfy seat.

Hanuman bowed to his elders, then told them everything.  "I saw Sita!" he said. "She's safe, but sad and needs help." He described Sita – looking a little weak and lonely.

The monkeys were overjoyed! Angada, a strong monkey prince, praised Hanuman.  "You are the bravest monkey ever! You crossed the ocean and found Sita!  Now we can go and help Rama!"

Everyone sat down, excited to hear Hanuman's amazing story of Lanka, Sita, and the bad king Ravana.  Angada sat with Hanuman and Jambavan, and all the monkeys listened, happy to be together again.  The mountain shone brightly as everyone celebrated Hanuman's bravery and success.
