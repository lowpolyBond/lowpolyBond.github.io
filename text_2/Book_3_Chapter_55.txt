Ravana, a powerful king, thought he was ready for anything.  He was very much in love with Sita.  He wanted her badly!

He took Sita to his beautiful palace. It was huge and sparkly!  It had lots of rooms, and many, many women lived there.  Pretty birds sang all around.  The floors were made of shiny stones, and the walls were gold and silver!  There were fountains with lovely flowers.

Ravana showed Sita everything. Then he said, "Sita, I am very powerful! Ten thousand soldiers follow me!  This whole kingdom is yours!  Be my queen! I love you more than anything!"

He boasted, "My city, Lanka, is surrounded by the ocean.  Nobody can attack it, not even the gods!  Nobody is stronger than me.  Rama, your husband, is far away. He is poor and weak.  He can't help you. You'll be much happier with me. Forget about him!"

Ravana continued, "My flying chariot is super fast!  We can fly anywhere! You can wear beautiful jewels and have so much fun!  Your sadness will go away."  He even said he would be her servant!

Sita was very sad. She hid her face and cried.

Ravana said again, "Please, Sita, be my wife! I will do anything for you!  I've never begged a woman before!"

Ravana thought, "Sita will be mine!"  But he was wrong.  Sita was very brave, and she would never give up on Rama.
