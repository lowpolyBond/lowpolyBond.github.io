Once upon a time, a group of tired monkeys found a wise, old hermit.  They were very hungry and tired from a long journey.  The monkeys told the hermit their story.

"We're looking for Sita," said Hanuman, the strongest monkey. "She was taken by the mean King Ravana!  Our king, Sugriva, sent us to find her. We searched everywhere, even across the ocean!  We were so hungry, we found this cave for shelter."

The monkeys explained how theyâ€™d found a dark, scary cave, and how swans and geese flew out.  They entered the cave and were really scared. The hermit was kind and gave them food.

The monkeys thanked the hermit. "But we have to leave," Hanuman said worriedly. "Our king will be angry if we're late!"

The hermit smiled. "This cave is tricky," he said.  "To get out safely, you must close your eyes tight."

The monkeys all squeezed their eyes shut.  In a flash, the hermit used his magic to whisk them outside!  They were safe!

"You are now on the Vindhya mountains!" said the hermit, pointing to the beautiful mountains and the ocean.  "Go and be brave!"

The hermit went back into the cave, and the monkeys continued their search for Sita. They were happy and grateful to the hermit for helping them.
