King Ravana of Lanka got a message.  His spies said Rama and his HUGE army were nearby! Ravana was scared. He asked his spy, Shardula, "What happened? Did those monkeys capture you?"

Shardula was shaking. He whispered, "King, those monkeys are like strong lions! They're everywhere! I tried to sneak around, but they caught me!  They punched and kicked me! They even showed me their whole army!  Rama himself saved me from being killed!"

Shardula explained, "Rama's army is ready to attack Lanka!  He's even made his army look like a giant bird!  You need to decide: give Sita back, or get ready for a BIG fight!"

Ravana thought hard.  He yelled, "Even if the whole world was in danger, I would NEVER give Sita back!"

Ravana wanted to know more about Rama's army. He asked Shardula, "Tell me about these monkey warriors! Who are they?"

Shardula started listing names:  "There's the strong son of Riksharaja, and the sons of Gadgada.  There's the son of Shatakratu's teacher—the one who killed many giants!  And Sushena, Saumya, and many more brave monkeys.  There's Hanuman, the son of the Wind!  And Angada, grandson of the powerful god Indra!  There are TONS of monkeys—millions and millions!"

Shardula continued, "Rama is super strong! He beat many, many giants!  His brother Lakshmana is also very brave.  There's also Nala, a very strong monkey.  And even your brother, Vibhishana, is now helping Rama!"

Shardula finished, "That's Rama's army on Mount Suvela.  It's up to you, King, to decide what to do!"
