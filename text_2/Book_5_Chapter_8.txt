Hanuman, the clever monkey, stopped and looked closely at a beautiful chariot.  It was made of shiny gold, covered in sparkling jewels.  It was so amazing, even the best builder in the world thought it was the most beautiful thing ever made!  It flew through the sky like a bright star.

King Ravana had this amazing chariot, called Pushpaka. He got it because he was very powerful.  He could just think where he wanted to go, and the chariot would take him there! It was super fast, like the wind!  Many happy people rode in it. It had lots of rooms and beautiful things inside.  It was as shiny and clean as the moon.  It looked like a big, sparkly mountain!  Thousands of strong demons with big eyes pulled it through the sky, day and night.  The chariot was covered in pretty flowers, making it even more beautiful than springtime.

Hanuman, the brave monkey prince, couldn't take his eyes off the wonderful Pushpaka chariot.
