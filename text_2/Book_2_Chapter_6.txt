Rama and Sita were very happy.  They prayed to God Narayana. Rama offered special butter to the fire.  Then, they ate a little food and went to sleep in the temple.  

Before sunrise, they woke up.  Their servants cleaned and made the palace beautiful. Rama and Sita listened to happy stories.  Then they prayed.  When the sun came up, they said hello to the sun, which they thought was like God.  They asked wise people to sing beautiful prayers.

The prayers were so pretty!  Drums beat, too.  Everyone in the city of Ayodhya was excited. They knew Rama and Sita were praying and celebrating.  

People decorated the city for Rama's big day!  They put up pretty trees and flags everywhere.  Actors sang and danced. Everyone talked about Rama becoming king! Even the children were excited!

The streets were filled with flowers and sweet smells. Lamps were everywhere, so the city would be bright at night.

People gathered together to talk about King Dasaratha, Rama's father.  They said he was a good king, and they were so happy Rama was going to rule. They said Rama was kind, smart, and good.

News spread far and wide!  Lots of people came to Ayodhya. The city was so full of people, it was like the ocean! It was a very special day, a full moon day!  Everyone was ready for Rama to become king.
