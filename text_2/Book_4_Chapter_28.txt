Rama and Lakshmana were living on a big mountain.  Rama had just helped Sugriva, a monkey king, become king again.  It was the rainy season.

"Look, Lakshmana!" Rama said. "The sky is full of huge, gray clouds!  The sun has pulled all the water from the ocean, and now the rain is coming down."

Rama looked at the sky.  "It looks like someone hurt and wrapped in wet cloths," he said. "The clouds are like bandages, and the sunset makes them pretty colors."  The wind felt gentle, like a soft breath. The earth was crying tears, just like Sita, Rama's wife, who was far away and sad. The wind smelled sweet and cool.

"See those Arjuna trees," Rama pointed. "They're all blossoming, like Sugriva is happy now that his enemies are gone!" The clouds covered the mountains like soft blankets.  The mountains looked like wise people reading holy books.

"The lightning is like bright whips cracking in the sky," Rama said. "It reminds me of Sita struggling with the mean king, Ravana, who took her away." The dark clouds hid the moon and stars.

"Even the flowers look sad," Rama said. "But they're happy for the rain, just like I'm happy to see them.  I'm sad because Sita is gone."

The hot weather was over.  The roads were muddy.  Even the birds were hurrying home.

Rama said, "Look at the sky! It looks like a big ocean surrounded by hills. The rivers are flowing fast.  Mangoes are falling from the trees, and the jambu fruits are ready to eat!"

Rama described the rain making sounds like elephants fighting.  He saw cranes flying with the clouds, like pretty flowers in the wind. The earth looked green and pretty.

The rain made everyone happy.  Peacocks danced, and elephants trumpeted.  The rivers flowed fast. Everyone was happy except Rama.  He missed Sita.

Rama explained that the monkeys and the elephants loved the rainy season, but he was waiting to find his wife Sita. He would wait until the rains were over.

Lakshmana said, "Don't worry, Rama!  Sugriva will help you soon."  Rama would wait for the right time to ask Sugriva for help. He would wait for the rainy season to be over.
