Once upon a time, Rama was talking to someone.  Suddenly, a very important holy man named Durvasa arrived at the palace.  He was grumpy and said, "Tell Rama I'm here! It's very important!"

Lakshmana, Rama's brother, bowed and said, "Please wait a little. Rama is busy right now."

But Durvasa was very angry! He glared at Lakshmana and shouted, "Tell Rama *now*, or I will put a terrible curse on everyone â€“ Rama, Bharata, the whole kingdom, and you too!"

Lakshmana was scared. He thought, "It's better for me to be in trouble than for everyone else to suffer!" So he rushed to tell Rama.

Rama quickly went to see the holy man. He bowed respectfully and asked, "What can I do for you?"

Durvasa said, "I finished a thousand-year fast today!  I'm hungry! Give me your food!"

Rama was happy to help. He gave Durvasa the best food they had.  Durvasa ate it all and said, "Thank you!" Then he went away.

But Rama remembered something scary. Before Durvasa came, Rama had talked to Death! Death had warned him of a great danger. Rama felt very sad and worried. He thought, "Everything is ruined!"  He was very quiet and upset.
