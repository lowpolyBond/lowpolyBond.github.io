Joy reigned in heaven where every eye
Had seen the Lord of Lanká die.
In cars whose sheen surpassed the sun’s
Triumphant rode the radiant ones:
And Rávaṇ’s death, by every tongue,
And Ráma’s glorious deeds were sung.
They praised the Vánars true and brave,
The counsel wise Sugríva gave.
The deeds of Hanúmán they told,
The valiant chief supremely bold,
The strong ally, the faithful friend,
And Sítá’s truth which naught could bend.

To Mátali, whom Indra sent,
His head the son of Raghu bent:
And he with fiery steeds who clove
The clouds again to Swarga drove.
Round King Sugríva brave and true
His arms in rapture Ráma threw,
Looked on the host with joy and pride,
And thus to noble Lakshmaṇ cried:

“Now let king-making drops be shed,
Dear brother, on Vibhishaṇ’s head
For truth and friendship nobly shown,
And make him lord of Rávaṇ’s throne.”
This longing of his heart he told:
And Lakshmaṇ took an urn of gold
And bade the wind-fleet Vánars bring
Sea water for the giants’ king.
The brimming urn was swiftly brought:
Then on a throne superbly wrought
Vibhishaṇ sat, the giants’ lord,
And o’er his brows the drops were poured.
As Raghu’s son the rite beheld
His loving heart with rapture swelled:
But tenderer thoughts within him woke,
And thus to Hanúmán he spoke:

“Go to my queen: this message give:
Say Lakshmaṇ and Sugríva live.
The death of Lanká’s monarch tell,
And bid her joy, for all is well.”
