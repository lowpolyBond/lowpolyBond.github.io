After the battle, Ravana's wives were very sad.  Mandodari, his main wife, was especially heartbroken.  She looked at Ravana's dead body and cried, "My husband, the mighty warrior, even the gods were afraid of you!  How could Rama, a simple man, defeat you?"

She wondered if it was magic, or even a god who killed him. But then she said, "No, it was Vishnu, the great god, who came to Earth in a human form, helped by monkey gods, to defeat you.  You were so powerful, but you let your bad actions control you."

Mandodari was very upset. She reminded Ravana how he kidnapped Sita, Rama's wife, and how this caused so much trouble. "You ignored my warnings! Your pride and your actions caused your own downfall," she sobbed.  She missed their happy times together,  all the beautiful things they had, now gone. She felt so lonely and lost.

Mandodari's friends tried to comfort her, reminding her that even kings' fortunes change.

Rama then told Vibhishana, Ravana's good brother, "Please take care of your brother's funeral and comfort his wives."

Vibhishana thought hard.  He said, "Ravana was cruel and wicked. He doesn't deserve a proper funeral."  But Rama said, "Even though he was bad, he was also a powerful warrior.  Let's give him a proper farewell.  It's the right thing to do."

Vibhishana, even though he didn't fully agree, organized a grand funeral for Ravana.  There were carts and wood, fire and beautiful decorations.  Everyone was very sad.  The funeral pyre burned brightly as people mourned.

After the funeral, Vibhishana went back to Rama. Rama, relieved the battle was over, felt happy. He put down his bow and arrow, and he was no longer angry.  He had won, and peace returned.
