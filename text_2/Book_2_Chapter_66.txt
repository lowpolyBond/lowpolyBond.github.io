King Dasaratha died.  Queen Kaushalya was very, very sad. She held his body in her lap.  He looked like a candle that had gone out.

"Kaikeyi," she cried to the other queen, "you got what you wanted.  You rule now.  You sent Rama away, and now the king is gone too.  I'm all alone.  I don't want to live anymore!"

Kaushalya was heartbroken. She worried about Rama, Sita, and even King Janaka, Sita's father.  She said Sita would be scared in the forest, all alone with Rama.

The wise minister helped Queen Kaushalya.  He carefully placed the king's body in a big container filled with oil.  The palace ladies cried.  They missed Rama very much.  They were scared of Kaikeyi, who had sent Rama away.

The whole city of Ayodhya was sad.  Everyone missed King Dasaratha. It was like a dark night without any stars.  People were angry with Queen Kaikeyi. They felt she was mean.

The kingâ€™s friends decided to wait for Rama to return before they had the funeral.  They kept his body safe in the oil until then.  The city was filled with sadness. Everyone mourned the good king.
