Prince Bharata, the new king, was on a journey. He left his army and fancy clothes behind. He walked to a wise man's home, Sage Bharadvaja.  He was guided by his teacher, Vasishtha.

The sage welcomed Bharata. He offered him food and asked about Ayodhya.  He already knew King Dasaratha had died, so he didn't ask about him. Bharata and Vasishtha asked the sage about his life and the forest animals.

Then, the sage asked Bharata a hard question: "You're king now.  Did you want Rama banished to the forest?  Did you want to be king?"

Bharata's eyes filled with tears.  "No!" he cried.  "I never wanted this! My mother made this happen, but I don't agree with her. I'm going to find Rama and bring him home!"

The sage smiled.  He knew Bharata was a good man. "I know where Rama is," he said. "He's on a mountain called Cittrakuta. Go there tomorrow."

Bharata stayed the night at the sage's home.  He was a good king, and everyone knew it.  He was going to find his brother.
