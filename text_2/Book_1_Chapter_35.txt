The sun came up.  Wise Vishvamitra woke Prince Rama. "Good morning, Rama! Let's go!"

Rama said his prayers.  "Teacher," he asked, "how do we cross the shallow Shona River?"

Vishvamitra pointed. "Follow the path the wise men took."  They walked through pretty forests.

Later, they reached the Ganges River. It was beautiful, with swans and cranes!  Rama, Lakshmana, and the wise men were happy. They bathed and prayed.

Rama asked Vishvamitra, "Teacher, tell me about this amazing river!  It flows everywhere!"

Vishvamitra smiled. "Rama, the great Himalayan mountains had two beautiful daughters.  One was Ganga, the other Uma."

"The gods needed Ganga to help them with a special ceremony.  So, her father let her go to heaven with them."

"Ganga, the river, is the daughter of the mountains.  She cleanses everything!  Uma, her sister, married a great god."

"So, Rama," Vishvamitra finished, "that's the story of the beautiful Ganga River, a gift from the mountains to the world!"
