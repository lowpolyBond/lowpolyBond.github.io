King Dasharatha was very sad.  He heard Rama, his son, speaking, and saw him dressed simply, not like a prince.  The king fainted!  His other wives cried.  He woke up and cried, "I must have done something bad in a past life!  Kaikeyi is making me so sad, but I can't die yet.  I see Rama, my amazing son, dressed like a poor man!  This is all Kaikeyi's fault!"

He cried, "Rama! Rama!"  He couldn't speak anymore.  Then he told Sumantra, his driver, "Get the best chariot! Take Rama out of the city!"  He thought, "Being good makes you suffer! My best son is being sent away."

Sumantra got a beautiful chariot with fast horses.  "The chariot is ready, Prince Rama," he said.

The king told his treasurer, "Give Sita, Rama's wife, beautiful clothes and jewelry for her fourteen years in the forest." Sita got dressed in lovely things. She looked like the sun shining brightly!

Queen Kaushalya hugged Sita. "Many wives leave their husbands when things get hard," she said. "But you are different, Sita. You're good and loyal. Don't blame my son.  See him as a god, rich or poor."

Sita said, "I'll always be with Rama. My parents taught me that. A wife needs her husband.  He's like a god to me."  Queen Kaushalya felt better.

Rama told his mother, "Don't be angry with Father.  Fourteen years will pass quickly.  I'll be back soon."

Rama then spoke to his father's other wives.  He said, "If I did anything wrong, please forgive me." They cried even more.

The palace was quiet.  No more happy drums. Only sad crying could be heard.
