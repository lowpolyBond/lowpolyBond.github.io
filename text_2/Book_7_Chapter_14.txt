Ravana, a super strong demon king, was very proud. He and his six helpers – Mahodara, Prahasta, Marica, Shuka, Sarana, and Dhumraksha – were ready for a big fight. They were like a storm, ready to take over the world!

Ravana marched through cities, rivers, and mountains. He went to Mount Kailasha, a very important mountain.  The Yakshas, who lived there, were scared! They were worried because Ravana was the brother of their king. They told their king, Dhaneshwara, what Ravana was planning. Dhaneshwara said, "Okay, let's fight!"

The Yakshas and Ravana's army fought a huge battle! It was like a crazy ocean storm!  Ravana and his friends were very strong. They fought bravely.  One of Ravana's friends, Dushana, was hit with lots of weapons, but he didn't fall! He was as strong as a mountain!

Ravana was even stronger. He swung his big club and knocked over many Yakshas.  His friends also won the battle, leaving only a few Yakshas to escape.  The battle was so fierce that the ground was covered with broken weapons.

Seeing that some Yakshas were defeated, Dhaneshwara sent more Yakshas to help.  One strong Yaksha, Samyodhakantaka, fought Ravana's friend, Marica. Marica was knocked down!

Ravana got angry! He fought bravely against the Yakshas. One Yaksha tried to stop him at a door, but Ravana broke it down!  He was so strong that he even used the broken door to fight!  Another Yaksha turned to dust!

The Yakshas were so scared of Ravana's strength that they ran away, hiding in rivers and caves, dropping their weapons.  Ravana and his friends had won a very big and scary battle!
