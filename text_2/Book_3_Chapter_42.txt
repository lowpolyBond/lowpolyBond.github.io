Ravana, a bad king, wanted to kidnap Sita. He asked Marica, a clever demon, for help. Marica was scared of Rama, Sita's husband, who was very strong.  "Rama is too powerful!" said Marica. "Anyone who fights him will lose!" But Marica agreed to help.

Ravana was happy. He took Marica in his shiny flying chariot, pulled by strange creatures.  They flew to where Rama lived.

Ravana pointed to Rama's home. "Now, turn into a deer," he told Marica.

Marica changed into a beautiful deer!  This deer had sparkling horns, a shiny coat, and beautiful colours. It looked like the most amazing deer ever!

The magical deer pranced around Sita, Rama's wife. Sita was picking flowers. When she saw the beautiful deer, she was amazed! It was the most beautiful deer she'd ever seen. The deer was so pretty, Sita wanted Rama to catch it.

The deer ran here and there, showing off its colours. It was so charming, Sita couldnâ€™t take her eyes off it.  She really wanted Rama to catch that deer!
