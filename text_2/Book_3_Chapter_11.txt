Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana went on a long walk. They saw beautiful hills, flat lands, forests, and sparkling rivers.  Lots of animals lived there! Geese and cranes flew near the water, and deer, buffaloes, bears, and even elephants roamed around.

After a long time, they found a huge, beautiful lake at sunset. It was full of lovely lotus flowers and lots of elephants, geese, and swans.

They heard singing and music from the lake, but they couldn't see anyone!  Rama and Lakshmana asked a wise man named Dharmabhrit, "Wise man, where is this music coming from?"

The wise man told them a magical story.  He said the lake, called Pancapsara, was made by a very, very old wise man named Mandarkini.  Mandarkini was so good he almost became a god!  But the real gods were worried. To stop him, they sent five beautiful magical women to live with him.

He fell in love with them, and they built a secret home in the lake.  That's why they heard the music – it was the magical women singing and playing!

Rama and Lakshmana stayed in a place where many wise men lived, for a very long time. Ten years went by!  They played and had fun.

Then, Rama wanted to meet a very important wise man named Agastya.  Another wise man, Sutikshna, told Rama how to find Agastya's home.  It was a long way, but Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana walked happily.

On the way, Rama saw a place with lots of yummy fruits and flowers.  He knew this was the home of Agastya's brother!  Rama told Lakshmana a scary story about two mean demons who used to live there.  They tricked good people and ate them!  But Agastya's brother was very brave. He defeated the bad demons!

Rama and Sita stayed the night at Agastya's brother's home.  The next day, they went to see Agastya. The forest was beautiful and full of animals and birds. They finally reached Agastya’s home – it was a peaceful and magical place.  Rama knew he would be safe there.
