Queen Kaushalya was very sad.  Her son, Rama, was gone.  She saw the king, also very sad.  She said, "King, that mean Kaikeyi sent Rama away to the forest!  It's like a scary snake slithering into our home.  It would have been better if she'd made Rama a poor man in the city, or even her servant! But she sent him far away.

Rama, strong and brave, is walking to the forest with Sita and Lakshmana. He's never been unhappy before!  How will he live in the forest, eating only berries and roots?  Will he ever come home?

I want to see Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita again.  I want to see Ayodhya celebrate his return!  I want to see everyone happy, throwing flowers and rice as he comes home, like a bull leading his cows back to town.

I want to see my sons, Rama and Bharata, return, strong and handsome. I want to see them ride through the city, people cheering and giving them gifts. I want to see Rama run to me, like a happy child!  I love him so much!

Kaikeyi took my son away.  I feel like a cow whose baby has been stolen by a lion.  Rama is so smart and kind. I can't live without him.  This sadness is burning me up!"
