A giant named Kumbhakarna, as big as a mountain, jumped over the city walls! He roared so loud it shook the ground and made the ocean splash.

The monkey army saw him.  They were scared! They ran away.  Prince Angada shouted, "Stop! Don't be scared!  He's just trying to scare you! We're stronger together! Come back and fight!"

Slowly, the monkeys came back. They picked up big sticks and trees. They bravely attacked Kumbhakarna. They threw rocks and trees at him, but Kumbhakarna was too strong! He hit them hard, and many monkeys got hurt.  Some monkeys ran into the sea, some ran into the mountains, and some just fell down, tired and scared.

Angada shouted again, "Wait! Don't run!  If we die fighting, we'll go to a wonderful place in the sky! If we run, our wives will laugh at us! Come back and fight!"

But the monkeys said, "Kumbhakarna is too strong! We want to live!"  They ran away again.

Angada was smart. He kept talking to them, and some of the bravest monkeys listened.  They came back to fight, ready to face the giant, Kumbhakarna!
