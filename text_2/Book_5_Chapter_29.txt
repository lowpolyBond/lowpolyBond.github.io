Once upon a time, Princess Sita was very sad and worried.  But then, she noticed some amazing things! It was like magic!

First, her left eye twitched, like a little fish making a tiny lotus flower spin. Then, her arm, which her husband, Rama, often used as a pillow, started to shake.  Even her leg moved a little bit!  It was all very strange, but Sita knew these were good signs.

She also saw her beautiful sari fall off her shoulder. It was dusty, but Sita knew it was a lucky sign.  It meant she'd see Rama soon!

All these amazing things made Sita feel much better. She wasn't sad anymore. Her face looked bright and beautiful, like the moon!  She felt happy and healthy again.  She knew good things were coming, and she was ready to see Rama again!
