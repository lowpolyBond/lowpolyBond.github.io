Long ago, in a time called Kritayuga, there was a very wise man named Paulastya. He was so good and powerful, everyone loved him.  He went to a mountain to pray and be quiet.

Some young girls, the daughters of other wise people, went to play in the woods near his quiet place. They were noisy and playful, and they bothered Paulastya.  He was so upset, he said, "Any girl who looks at me will have a baby!"

The girls ran away, scared! But one girl, the daughter of a wise king, didn't hear him. She saw Paulastya, and she became pregnant!

She was very worried and told her father. Her father, the wise king, knew what happened.  He went to Paulastya and said, "Please accept my daughter. She will be a good wife."

Paulastya said, "Okay." He married the girl and loved her very much. He was so happy, he said, "I will give you a son, as good as me.  His name will be Vishravas."

And that's how Vishravas was born! He was a wonderful son, just like his father and mother. He was very kind and smart.  This is the story of how Ravana's grandfather was born. (I'll tell you about Ravana later!)
