Once upon a time, there was a king named Lomapada.  He really wanted a wise man named Rishyasringa to come visit his kingdom.  Rishyasringa was a very holy young man who lived all alone in the forest.

The king's helpers had a clever plan.  "Rishyasringa only knows about prayers and being holy," they said. "Let's send beautiful women to meet him!  He's never seen anyone like that before."

The king agreed.  Beautiful women went into the forest.  Rishyasringa, who'd never seen women before, was surprised! They were pretty and sang lovely songs.  He invited them to his home.

The women gave Rishyasringa yummy treats he'd never tasted.  He loved them!  They tricked him, leaving him sad when they went away.

The next day, the women came back.  Rishyasringa, still a little sad, went with them to the city.  As he entered, it started raining!  Everyone was happy because it meant good luck!

King Lomapada was so excited! He met Rishyasringa, gave him gifts, and asked him to be happy. Then, the king married Rishyasringa to his daughter, Princess Shanta.

Rishyasringa lived happily ever after in the kingdom, loved by everyone.  He was a very important and respected man!
