Hanuman, the brave monkey, had found Sita in his thoughts. He jumped from the wall! Wow!  The garden was beautiful! It was springtime.  He saw so many pretty flowers and trees: mango trees, golden flowers, and so many more! Birds sang sweet songs. Deer played in the grass.  It was like a magical place.

The garden was full of happy sounds.  Cuckoos sang, bees buzzed, peacocks cried.  Hanuman felt happy too!

He was searching for Sita, the princess.  He woke up some sleepy birds. When they flew, pretty flowers fell all around him.  The animals thought Hanuman was the spring god! He was covered in blossoms.

Hanuman was jumping and playing.  He shook the trees so much that all the flowers and leaves fell down! The trees looked sad and bare, like theyâ€™d lost a game.

He ran and jumped everywhere. He saw shiny gold and silver paths! There were pretty ponds with clear water.  Lots of pretty gems and pearls sparkled!  Beautiful birds swam in the water.

He saw a tall, bright hill. A river flowed down like a girl running away from her friend! Then, it went back, like the girl decided to stay!

Then, he saw a sparkling pool with a fountain! It was full of deer and pretty flowers.  There were even houses built by a magical builder!

Hanuman found a giant golden tree.  It shone like the sun!  He climbed up.

"Maybe I can see Sita from here," he thought. "She must be sad, missing Rama. She loves the forest. She'll come to this pretty pool."

Hanuman hid in the golden tree. He waited to see Sita, the beautiful princess.
