Once upon a time, after a big fire, a magical being appeared. He held Sita, Rama's wife, in his arms.  Sita was beautiful, like the sunrise, all dressed up in pretty clothes. The magical being, who was like a god of fire, gave Sita back to Rama.

He told Rama, "Sita is innocent!  While she was trapped with the mean Ravana, she only ever thought about you.  Even though bad things happened, she never, ever loved anyone else. She was always true to you."

Rama was so happy!  He thought for a moment. Then he said, "I know Sita is innocent. But people might think I’m not a good king, if I didn’t test her.  Ravana is powerful, but he could never make Sita love him. She's as loyal as the sun to its light!  She's mine, always!"

Rama was very happy to have Sita back. They were together again, and everyone was happy for them. The end.
