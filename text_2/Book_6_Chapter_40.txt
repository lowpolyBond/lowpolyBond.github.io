Rama, Sugriva, and the monkey army climbed a huge mountain. From the top, they saw Lanka, Ravana's beautiful island city.  Ravana, a powerful king, stood at the gate. He was big and strong, wearing shiny red clothes. He had scars from old battles.

Sugriva, brave and strong, jumped down from the mountain.  He shouted, "I'm Rama's friend! You can't escape!" He grabbed Ravana's crown and threw it on the ground!

Ravana was angry.  "You'll be sorry!" he roared.  They wrestled!  It was a HUGE fight! They punched, kicked, and threw each other. They tumbled and rolled, like two playful elephants!  They were so strong, they looked like trees locked together!

Ravana used magic!  Sugriva, clever and quick, flew into the sky!  Ravana was tired and surprised.

Sugriva, the monkey king, won! He flew back to Rama and the monkey army, everyone was very happy.  Sugriva was a hero!
