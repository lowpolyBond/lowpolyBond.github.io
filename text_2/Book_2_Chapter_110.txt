Long ago, in a land far away, lived a prince named Rama.  He was very angry!  A wise man named Javali had said something that upset him.

Another wise man, Vasishtha, spoke to Rama.  "Rama," he said, "Javali believes in something called reincarnation â€“ that souls are reborn.  He just wants you to go home!"

Vasishtha then told Rama a wonderful story about how the world began. "First," he said, "there was only water. Then, the Earth appeared!  Then came Brahma, the creator, and all the gods.

Brahma had a son, and his son had a son, and so on, and on, and on!  Each son became a king.  This went on for a very long time.  Many kings were good, some were bad. One king, Trishanku, was so good he went to heaven while he was still alive!

Many kings followed, each one the son of the last.  There was a king who drained the ocean!  Another king was very mean and got sent away. One king was brave and powerful, others were wise and kind.  And this long line of kings continued for ages.

The story went on and on, with more kings and queens and their children. Finally, Vasishtha said, "Rama, you are part of this long line of kings! Your father, Dasaratha, was a great king.  In your family, the oldest son always becomes king.  You are the oldest son. You must be king!"

Vasishtha told Rama that it was very important for him to follow the family's rules and become the king.  Rama should rule the land, just like all the kings before him.
