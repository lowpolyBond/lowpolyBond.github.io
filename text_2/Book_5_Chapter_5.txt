Hanuman, the brave monkey, looked up at the moon.  It was big and bright, like a shiny pearl in the sky!  It shone on everything, making the world look beautiful.

The moon was so bright, it looked like a swan on a nest, or a lion in a cave! It was as big and round as a buffalo or a tall mountain.  The moon's light chased away all the darkness.

Hanuman flew to Lanka, a big city.  He saw lots of things. He saw people talking loudly, some happy, some angry. He saw elephants and beautiful women.  Some women were getting ready, others were sleeping, and some were laughing with their husbands.

The city was noisy and busy, like a lake full of snakes!  There were many rich people, and also poor people.  Everyone was busy with their own lives.

Hanuman looked everywhere for Sita, Rama's wife.  He wanted to find her and bring her back.  But he couldn't find her anywhere.  Sita was sad and missed Rama very much. She was hidden and looked very different from her usual beautiful self. She was very lonely.

After searching a long time, Hanuman couldnâ€™t find Sita.  He felt very sad and worried.  He had failed to find her.
