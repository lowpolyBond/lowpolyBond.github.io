In ages past, when gods did scheme,
In sacred lore, a mystic dream,
Lord Shiva in ascetic trance,
With Fire-god's gaze, in cosmic dance.
Celestial hosts, their leader sought,
To Brahma's realm, their plea was brought,
Vishvamitra's voice in tales did flow,
To Rama's ears, the legends grow.
"O Brahma, grant us your decree,
As Shiva's might, he seeks to see,
For worlds' welfare, we implore,
Our path ahead, we can't ignore."
Brahma, wise, to gods did say,
"Goddess Uma's words hold sway,
Shiva's seed in Ganga's flow,
A warrior son, the world shall know."
Rama heard of gods' request,
Their hopes on Shiva's power rest,
They worshipped Brahma, bowed in grace,
At Kailash, they found their place.
To Fire-god, gods did plea,
"Release Shiva's might, set it free,
In Ganga's womb, let it reside,
Our chosen chief, with strength and pride."

Ganga heard and took her form,
Radiant, she defied the norm,
Fire-god spread his essence wide,
In Ganga's flow, Shiva's seed did ride.
Rama, listen to the tale unfold,
Ganga's rills with Shiva's gold,
On earth, it touched, a transformation,
Elements formed, a grand creation.
Himalayas gleamed in golden sheen,
With Ganga's glow, a wondrous scene,
From grass to trees, all turned to gold,
In legends, Skanda's tale was told.
From the embryo, Kaartikeya emerged,
Krittika stars, his fate converged,
Milk from heavens, they did share,
The boy with fire, beyond compare.
Gods named him Skanda, warrior bold,
From Ganga's flow, his legend told,
With six faces, his might did grow,
Chief of celestial troops in tow.
As Skanda stood, the gods did cheer,
With Fire-god's grace, their leader near,
This tale of Ganga, mystic and grand,
In rhymes, I share, as you understand.
A devotee of Kartikeya's fame,
Shall thrive with honor, and a name,
With longevity, sons, and grace,
In Skanda's abode, their final place.
