Once upon a time, a long, long time ago, there was a brave king named Sagara. He lived in Ayodhya and loved his people very much.  But he and his queens, Keshini and Sumati, didn't have any children.

King Sagara went to the mountains and prayed very hard.  A wise, holy man called Maharishi Bhrigu was very happy with him.  He gave King Sagara a special wish! He said, "You will have many sons! One queen will have one son, and the other will have sixty thousand!"

Keshini and Sumati asked the wise man, "Which of us will have one son, and which will have sixty thousand?"

Maharishi Bhrigu said, "It's your choice!  Do you want one special son, or sixty thousand sons?"

Keshini wanted just one son. Sumati wanted sixty thousand!

Soon, Keshini had a baby boy named Asamanjasa.  Sumati had a big surprise!  A giant gourd appeared, and when it was opened, sixty thousand baby boys popped out!  They were all taken care of.

But Asamanjasa was a very naughty boy. He was mean and threw children into the river! The people of Ayodhya didn't like him, so they sent him away.

Asamanjasa had a son named Amshuman, who was kind and good.

After many years, King Sagara wanted to have a big, important ceremony. He called the priests to begin the preparations.  And that's where our story continues...
