The monkey chiefs were worried.  Then, a giant vulture, Sampati, told them good news!  He said, "I know where Sita is!"

The monkeys were so happy! Jambavan, their strongest leader, asked, "Where is Sita?  Who took her?"

Sampati explained, "My son, Suparshva, saw a scary ten-headed demon, Ravana, flying away with Sita.  She was crying out for Rama and Lakshmana."

Suparshva wanted to attack Ravana, but Ravana was too powerful.  Suparshva couldn't stop him.  He saw Sita's clothes were torn, and her hair was messy. She was very sad.

Sampati couldn't fly anymore because he was old and hurt. But he said, "I can help! You're strong and brave!  Rama and Lakshmana's arrows are super-powerful! Together, you can rescue Sita from Ravana!"

The monkeys cheered! They were ready to save Sita!  Sampati gave them hope, and they knew what they had to do. They were strong, and they would find Sita!
