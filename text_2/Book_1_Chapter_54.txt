Once upon a time, a powerful king named Vishvamitra wanted a special cow named Shabala.  She belonged to a wise, holy man named Vasishtha.  Vishvamitra tried to take Shabala, even though Vasishtha didn't want her to go.

Poor Shabala was very upset!  She cried, "Why is the king taking me away? I haven't done anything wrong!"  She ran to Vasishtha for help.

Vasishtha was sad. He said, "Shabala, the king is very strong. He has a big army with horses, elephants, and chariots. I can't stop him."

But Shabala was brave. She said, "You are much stronger than the king!  Use your magic to help me!"

Vasishtha said, "Okay, use your magic to create an army!"

Shabala made a magical army!  It started to fight Vishvamitra's army.  Vishvamitra was angry. He fought back with his own magic weapons.

Shabala's army was losing. So she created another army! This new army was even stronger!  They were shiny and golden, and they fought very bravely.

Vishvamitra used more of his magic, and it was a big battle!  The story of their magical fight continues...
