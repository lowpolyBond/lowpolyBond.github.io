Once upon a time, there were two giant eagles, brothers named Sampati and Jatayu. They were super strong fliers!  One day, to show off, they decided to race the sun!  They promised some wise old people they'd fly until the sun went down behind a faraway mountain.

Whoosh!  They soared up, up, up!  From so high, cities looked tiny, like little toy wheels. They could even hear music and see people dancing far below.  They flew over forests that looked like green ribbons, mountains that looked like pebbles, and rivers like thin lines.  Even the huge mountains, like Mount Meru, looked small!

But flying so high was hard work!  Sampati and Jatayu got very tired and sweaty. They were so high they couldn't even tell which way was which! The sun was so bright, it looked like the whole world was on fire!

Suddenly, Sampati saw his brother Jatayu falling!  Quickly, Sampati flew down to save him, using his wings to protect Jatayu from the sun's burning heat. But Sampati got badly burned himself!  He fell onto a mountain, hurt and sad.

His wings were broken, and he was too weak to fly anymore.  He felt so ashamed and tired that he just wanted to give up.  Poor Sampati! He told his story to a kind person, wishing he could just fly away and disappear.
