Long ago, in a land far away, lived a brave prince named Rama.  He needed help to rescue his wife, Sita.  He made a deal with a powerful monkey king named Sugriva. But Sugriva was lazy and didn't keep his promise!

Rama's brother, Lakshmana, was very angry.  He thought Sugriva was a bad monkey who didn't deserve to be king.  He told Rama, "Let's just kill Sugriva!"

But Rama was wise. He said, "No, Lakshmana. We must be patient.  Talk to Sugriva nicely. Remember why we made friends with him in the first place."

Lakshmana, even though he was still very mad, listened to his brother. He went to Sugriva's city, Kishkindha. It was a huge city, built inside a mountain!  Lakshmana was so angry that he accidentally broke some big trees on his way!

The monkeys of Kishkindha were scared of Lakshmana. They were HUGE and strong, but they ran away when they saw him!  They rushed to tell Sugriva, but he was asleep! He was too busy having fun and didn't care about Rama's request.

Two wise monkeys finally woke Sugriva up. They said, "King Sugriva! Rama's brother, Lakshmana, is here! He's very angry!  You have to go see him!"

Sugriva, finally realizing his mistake, rushed to meet Lakshmana.  He apologized for being lazy.  He promised to help Rama rescue Sita.  Lakshmana, seeing Sugriva's regret, calmed down.  Together, they would soon begin the search for Sita!
