Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana (Lakshmana is Rama's brother) were traveling.  They met a wise old man. The old man was very happy to see them. He said, "Welcome! Your long journey must have been tiring, especially for Sita."  Sita was Rama's wife.

The old man knew Sita had traveled far for Rama. He said, "Rama, make Sita happy.  Sometimes women are happy with their husbands only when things are good, but Sita is different. She's amazing!"

Rama bowed and thanked the old man.  He asked, "Wise man, can you tell us a good place to live? A place with lots of trees, water, and peace?"

The old man smiled. "Yes! Eight miles from here is Pancavati. It's a beautiful place with lots of yummy fruits, plants, and deer. It's near the Godaveri River."

He pointed towards some mountains and trees. "Go north, past those trees, over the hills, and you'll find it. Itâ€™s a wonderful place for Sita!"

Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita thanked the old man. They picked up their bows and arrows, and walked towards Pancavati, ready for their new home.  They were excited to explore their new, beautiful home.
