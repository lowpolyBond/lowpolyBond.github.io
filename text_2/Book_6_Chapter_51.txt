King Ravana heard a HUGE noise from the monkey army.  It was so loud, it sounded like rumbling clouds! He thought, "Those monkeys are very happy.  But Rama and Lakshmana are still hurt from Indrajit's magic arrows. This noise worries me!"

Ravana asked his helpers, "What's all the shouting about?"

The helpers quickly climbed the walls.  They saw Rama and Lakshmana! They weren't hurt anymore! They were free!  The helpers were scared and ran back to Ravana.

"Rama and Lakshmana are okay!" they cried. "The magic arrows don't work anymore!"

Ravana was very angry! "If my magic arrows don't work, I'm in trouble!" he roared.  He ordered Dhumraksha, a strong titan, "Go and kill Rama and Lakshmana!"

Dhumraksha gathered a HUGE army. They had swords, hammers, and spears â€“ all sorts of weapons! They marched towards Rama and Lakshmana.  They were loud and scary!

Dhumraksha rode in a fancy chariot pulled by mules.  But as he went, strange things happened!  Birds screamed. A vulture landed on his chariot.  A dead body fell, and blood rained from the sky!  It was scary!

Dhumraksha and his army saw the monkey army. It was HUGE, like a big wave!  They were scared!  The scary signs warned them that they would lose the battle.  Dhumraksha was afraid.  His big army was afraid. The battle hadn't even begun!
