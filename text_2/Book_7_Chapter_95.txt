Rama was sitting with lots of wise people, kings, and monkeys.  Kusha and Lava, two boys, were singing. Rama listened carefully. He knew who they were!  They were his sons!

Rama thought hard. He sent some very good messengers.  He told them to go to Sita, Rama’s wife.  He wanted the messengers to tell Sita:  “If you are good and innocent, prove it!  If you want to, and the wise Rishi agrees, you can take an oath tomorrow morning to show everyone you are telling the truth.”

The messengers went to a very important, wise man, a Rishi. They bowed down and told him Rama’s message. The Rishi said, “Yes, that’s fine!”  He wished them good luck.

The messengers rushed back to Rama.  They told him what the Rishi said. Rama was so happy! He told everyone, "Tomorrow, Sita will take an oath to prove she's innocent.  Please, everyone, come and watch!"

All the wise people and kings were very impressed. They said, "Rama, you are the fairest and kindest king!"

Rama said, "Tomorrow, Sita will take the oath." Then he told everyone they could go home.  He decided that Sita would prove she was innocent the next day.  Everyone went home to rest and prepare for the important day.
