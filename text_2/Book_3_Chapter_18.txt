Rama and Sita were living happily in the forest.  A mean, ugly monster named Shurpanakha saw Rama and fell in love!  She asked Rama to marry her.

Rama smiled and said, "I'm already married to Sita. But my brother Lakshmana is single.  He's kind and handsome. Maybe you'd like him?"

Shurpanakha, still wanting Rama, went straight to Lakshmana.  She said, "Marry me!"

Lakshmana laughed. He said, "Why would I marry you when my amazing brother is right here?  You should be with him!"

Shurpanakha was very angry. She yelled, "I'll eat Sita!" and she rushed at Sita!

Rama stopped her.  He told Lakshmana, "Shurpanakha is dangerous.  Stop her!"

Lakshmana was angry too. He swung his sword and chopped off Shurpanakha's ears and nose!

Shurpanakha screamed and ran away into the forest. She was hurt and very, very mad.

She ran to her brother, Khara, a powerful demon.  She told him everything. She was crying and bleeding.  Khara was furious that Rama and Lakshmana had hurt his sister.  He was ready for a fight!
