A vulture told the monkey army some great news:  Ravana, the bad guy, would be defeated!  The monkeys were so happy they jumped and shouted.

They raced to the ocean, excited to find Sita, Rama's wife.  Wow!  The ocean was HUGE! It was so big and powerful, it made the monkeys scared.  They looked at the giant waves and all the sea creatures, and they felt hopeless.  "What do we do now?" they cried.

Angada, a strong and brave monkey, saw how scared everyone was. He said, "Don't be afraid!  Being scared makes you weak.  We need to be brave!"

That night, Angada talked to the older monkeys.  He asked, "Who here is strong enough to jump across this giant ocean?  We need someone to go get Sita! Who can jump hundreds and hundreds of miles?"  He wanted someone brave enough to bring them all good news.

The monkeys were silent. Nobody spoke.  Then Angada tried again.  "Strong monkeys, brave monkeys, tell me â€“ how far CAN you jump?"  He waited, hoping someone would have a good answer.
