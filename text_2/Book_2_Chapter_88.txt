Bharata and his friends went to a place where Rama had slept.  He saw the grass where Rama had rested.  "Look!" Bharata said to his mothers. "Rama, our prince, slept on this hard ground! He used to sleep in a beautiful palace!  His palace had seven floors! It was filled with gold, silver, and soft carpets that smelled wonderful!  He had sweet music every morning! Now, he sleeps on the earth and hears scary animal noises. It's hard to believe!"

Bharata pointed to the grass. "Rama slept here, and Sita, his wife, was with him. See? There are tiny bits of gold from her jewelry. And look, a piece of her silk scarf!"  He sighed. "Poor Rama and Sita.  They slept here because of me. I feel terrible!"

Bharata looked sad. "Lakshmana is lucky. Heâ€™s with Rama.  Sita is brave too, going to the forest with him. But I... I miss Rama so much. Our city is empty and sad without him.  The animals roam free, the gates are open, and nobody is protecting our city!  It's like a ship without a captain!"

Bharata made a big decision. "From now on, I will live like a hermit! I'll sleep on the ground and eat only fruits and roots. I'll stay in the forest until Rama comes back. My brother Shatrughna will come with me. Lakshmana should stay with Rama to protect him. The wise men will bring Rama back to the city. Please, gods, help me!  Rama is kind. I hope he will let me serve him."
