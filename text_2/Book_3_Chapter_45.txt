Sita heard a scary sound.  She thought it was Rama, her husband. "Lakshmana!" she cried, "That's Rama! Go help him!  He sounds like he's in trouble!"

Lakshmana remembered Rama's orders to stay with Sita. He didn't go.  Sita was very angry.  "You pretend to care for Rama, but you won't help him!" she shouted. "You want me, so you don't care if Rama dies! If he's hurt, I don't want to live!"

Lakshmana said, "No one can beat Rama in a fight!  It's not really him. It's a trick!  Rama told me to protect you. I can't leave you alone.  Those bad creatures want to hurt us."

Sita was furious. "You lie!" she screamed. "You want Rama to be hurt! Maybe you're working against him! I only want Rama! I'd rather die than be with anyone else!"

Lakshmana was sad. He said, "I'm sorry, Sita.  Women can sometimes say things they don't mean. But your words hurt me. I must obey my brother.  I hope you are safe when I return."

Sita cried. "If Rama is gone, I will jump in the river! I will hang myself! I will go into the fire!  I will never be with anyone but Rama!"

Sita cried and cried. Lakshmana tried to comfort her, but she wouldn't listen.  Finally, Lakshmana bowed down and went to find Rama, looking back at Sita many times as he went.
