King Dasharatha was very sad.  He'd lost his kingdom!  The wise Vishvamitra saw him and said, "Don't worry, King! I'll help you. I'll get the best priests to help you have a big, important ceremony."  Vishvamitra wanted to help the king go to heaven.

Vishvamitra told his helpers, "Go find the smartest priests and the sons of Vasishtha! Tell them to come quickly!"

The helpers went everywhere to find the priests.  They came back and said, "Sir, almost everyone is coming, but the sons of Vasishtha are angry! They said, 'How can we help at a ceremony for a king who was once a low-born person?'"

Vishvamitra was furious! His eyes turned red. He shouted, "Those rude sons of Vasishtha will be punished! They'll eat dead things and be called 'Musthika' for a hundred lives! Even Mahodeva, who doubted me, will become a hunter who kills birds, and have a sad, sad life!"

Vishvamitra, very angry, stopped talking. He was surrounded by other wise men.
