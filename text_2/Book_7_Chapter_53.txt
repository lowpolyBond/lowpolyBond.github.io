Rama was amazed by what Lakshmana said.  He smiled and said, "Lakshmana, you're the best brother ever! You always understand me.  Listen carefully, because I need your help."

Rama sighed. "Four days ago, I should have helped my people, but I didn't.  My heart hurts.  Please call everyone â€“ my people, the priests, and the important helpers. A king who doesn't help his people every day goes to a very bad place!"

Rama told Lakshmana a story. "Long ago, there was a good king named Nriga. He gave many cows to the priests. But one poor priest's cow was accidentally given away.  He looked everywhere for it!"

"Finally, he found his old cow with another priest!  The two priests argued, and went to King Nriga to solve their problem. But the king didn't see them."

"The angry priests put a curse on King Nriga!  They said, 'Because you didn't help us, you'll become a lizard and hide for a very, very long time! Only when a great hero named Vasudeva comes, will you be free!'"

"Lakshmana," Rama said, "King Nriga is still a lizard because he didn't listen to his people.  That's why it's important to help everyone!  Please go and find out if anyone needs my help."
