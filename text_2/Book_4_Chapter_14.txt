Rama and Sugriva, along with their monkey friends, hid behind trees near Kishkindha, Bali's city.  Sugriva was really angry! He roared and roared, challenging his brother, Bali, to a fight.  He looked strong and bright, like the sun rising.

Sugriva showed Rama the city.  "Look!" he said. "That's Kishkindha!  It's full of monkeys and weapons.  Bali lives there.  Please, Rama, you promised to kill him!"

Rama smiled.  "I see you, Sugriva! I know you because of the special flower garland Lakshmana put around your neck. Today, I will help you. Show me where Bali is!" Rama said. "I will defeat him.  If I don't, you can be angry with me.  I once shot seven trees with one arrow! Bali will be no match for me!"

Rama promised he always keeps his word.  "Roar loudly, Sugriva! Call Bali out to fight!"

Sugriva let out a HUGE roar!  It was so loud!  The cows ran away, scared.  The deer jumped and ran like crazy horses.  Even the birds fell from the trees!

Then Bali roared back! He was strong and brave, ready for a fight!
