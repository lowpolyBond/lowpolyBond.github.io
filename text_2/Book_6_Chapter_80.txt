King Ravana was very angry when he heard that one of his best fighters, Maharaksha, had died. He gritted his teeth!  He decided to send his powerful son, Indrajita, to fight Rama and Lakshmana.

Ravana told Indrajita, "You've already beaten Indra, the mighty king of the gods! These two brothers are nothing compared to him. Go and defeat them!"

Indrajita obeyed. He went to a special fire ceremony.  Many other demons helped, carrying red turbans and offering things to the fire.  The fire blazed brightly, showing good luck for Indrajita.  He even offered a black deer!

Then, Indrajita climbed into his amazing chariot.  It was pulled by four horses and could even become invisible!  His chariot was shiny gold, with pictures of moons and gazelles.  His flag looked like a glowing fire!

Indrajita boasted, "Today, I will kill Rama and Lakshmana!  I'll get rid of all those pesky monkeys!"  He made his chariot invisible and zoomed into battle.

He rained down arrows on Rama and Lakshmana.  They fought back, shooting arrows that shone like the sun! But Indrajita was invisible, and he filled the sky with smoke and darkness. He was very hard to see!

Indrajita used special, powerful arrows that hurt Rama and Lakshmana badly. Many monkeys were also hit and fell to the ground.

Lakshmana was furious and wanted to use a super-powerful weapon to kill all the demons!  But Rama said, "No! We don't kill those who are hiding or running away. We'll use our best fiery arrows to defeat Indrajita."

Rama and Lakshmana kept shooting fiery arrows.  Even though Indrajita was invisible and very clever, Ramaâ€™s arrows finally found him. Indrajita was defeated!
