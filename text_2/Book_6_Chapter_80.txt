Upon hearing Makaraksha's fate, Ravana raged with ire,
His teeth ground in anger, his thoughts on fire.
He turned to Indrajit, his son of great might,
"Go, kill Rama and Lakshmana," he ordered in the night.

"O hero," he said, "you've conquered Indra in the past,
Now defeat these two, make their victory your last.
You are unmatched in strength, in battles you prevail,
Go, make them fall, let not their efforts avail."

Indrajit, obedient, to the fire made a plea,
Offered oblations with care, with devotion and glee.
As he did so, female demons in red turbans came near,
Their presence foretelling a battle both fierce and clear.

Weapons of war turned to tools for the rite,
As the sacrificial fire leapt, its flames shining bright.
The god of fire himself appeared in the blaze,
Accepting the offering with a majestic, fiery gaze.

Now equipped and ready, his chariot sublime,
Drawn by four horses, prepared for the prime.
With arrows and bow, its body adorned with gold,
Indrajit readied for battle, his spirit bold.

His chariot's flag-post waved with a fiery flare,
Decorated with gems, a sight quite rare.
Protected by a potent missile, with Brahma's grace,
Indrajit emerged, vanished, then took his place.

Invisible and swift, he descended from the sky,
Targeting Rama and Lakshmana from up high.
His arrows rained down like a tempestuous storm,
Covering the heroes, their forms they deform.

The sky obscured, the quarters cloaked in haze,
Indrajit's attack left no escape or ways.
Though Rama and Lakshmana fought with might,
His arrows eluded, disappearing from sight.

Amidst the dark clouds, the warriors stood tall,
As Indrajit continued his relentless thrall.
Steel arrows rained down, a relentless pour,
But the heroes fought back, their resolve evermore.

Golden arrows, sharp and true, they released,
To counter the onslaught, their power increased.
Yet Indrajit remained hidden from view,
His tactics elusive, his moves they couldn't construe.

As the battle raged on, with no end in sight,
Indrajit's darkness concealed his might.
But Rama and Lakshmana, with courage they'd gleaned,
Fought on undeterred, their spirits redeemed.

Invisible and fierce, Indrajit held his sway,
While Rama and Lakshmana continued to slay.
The monkeys watched, their hopes still high,
As the battle unfolded beneath the dark sky.

Lakshmana, in anger, proposed a mystic plan,
To employ potent missiles as part of their clan.
But Rama cautioned restraint, their purpose defined,
To target Indrajit alone, in the battle entwined.

With mystic missiles they'd pierce through the night,
Defeating the demon with unwavering might.
Though demons fell, it was Indrajit they'd seek,
Invisible or not, their victory they'd speak.

In the midst of this chaos, their thoughts intertwined,
Rama and Lakshmana, with purpose aligned.
To conquer Indrajit, the fierce, powerful foe,
Their mystic missiles aimed, they'd lay low.
