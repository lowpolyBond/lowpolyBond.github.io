Rama and his brother Lakshmana were walking in a scary forest.  It was full of deer, bears, and tigers!  The forest was all messed up.  A mean giant, Viradha, lived there. He was so scary that even the birds had flown away!

Viradha was HUGE! He looked really, really scary.  He had a big belly and sharp teeth.  He even carried a spear with dead animals on it!  Poor Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita were very afraid when they saw him.

Viradha roared and grabbed Sita!  He was going to make her his wife! He yelled at Rama and Lakshmana, “You’re going to die!  This forest is mine!”

Sita was so scared, she trembled. Rama felt terrible. He said to Lakshmana, "My dear friend, Viradha took Sita!  This is all because of my stepmother, Kaikeyi, who tricked my father into sending me away!" Rama was very sad.

But Lakshmana was brave!  He was angry.  He said, "Don't worry, brother! I'll fight Viradha!"  He aimed his arrow and shot Viradha.  The giant fell down dead. Lakshmana saved Sita!  They were all safe.
