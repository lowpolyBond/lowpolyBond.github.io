Rama, a very brave prince, told his guard to bring his brothers, Bharata and Lakshmana.  The guard did so. Rama hugged his brothers.

"I wanted to do a big ceremony called a Rajasuya Sacrifice," Rama explained. "It's like a huge party and a prayer, and it's supposed to make everything good.  Kings did it long ago to become even more powerful.  But I need you both to help me."

Bharata, who was very smart, spoke up.  "Brother," he said, "you are the best! Everyone loves you! You protect everyone.  But this sacrifice... it means hurting many kings and warriors.  It would make people sad. Please don't do it. You don't need to hurt anyone to be strong and good."

Rama listened carefully.  Bharata's words were kind and wise, like sweet honey.  Rama smiled.

"You're right, Bharata," Rama said happily. "Your words are so wise and good.  I won't do the sacrifice. A good king doesn't hurt people.  It's better to listen to good advice, even from a younger brother!"  Rama was very pleased with Bharata's wise words.  He decided to be a good king by not doing the big ceremony.
