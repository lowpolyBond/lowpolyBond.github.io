Once upon a time, a king had a hundred beautiful daughters.  A naughty wind god tried to make them his wives.  The princesses said no! They were not allowed to choose their own husbands while their father was still alive. They asked the wind god to ask their father first.  But the wind god was angry and made the princesses look strange and misshapen.

The princesses told their father what happened.  The king said, "You did the right thing! It's brave to be polite even to someone unkind. You have made our family proud!" He comforted them and promised to find them good husbands.

Far away, a very holy man named Chuli was praying. A lovely young woman named Somada served him. She was very kind and helpful. After a long time, Chuli was very happy with Somada and said, "You've been so good! I will grant you a wish."

Somada wished for a son, strong and kind, who would always do what was right.  She didn't want to marry.  Chuli, with his magical powers, gave her a son named Brahmadatta. Brahmadatta grew up to be a wonderful king.

Now, the king with the hundred daughters, King Kushanabha, wanted his daughters to marry Brahmadatta. Brahmadatta visited, and the wedding began!  As Brahmadatta held each princess's hand,  *poof!*  The strange shapes disappeared, and they were beautiful again!

King Kushanabha was so happy to see his daughters' beauty restored. He gave his daughters to Brahmadatta and sent their teachers along to live with them. Somada, Brahmadattaâ€™s mother, was overjoyed. She praised King Kushanabha for being such a good father.  Everyone lived happily ever after!
