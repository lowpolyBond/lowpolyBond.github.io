Rama, now king, was very busy. He took care of everyone in his kingdom. After a while, he spoke to King Janaka, Sita's father.

Rama said, "Thank you for helping me defeat Ravana!  Because of you, everyone is happy. Please go home.  My brother Bharata will walk with you."

King Janaka said, "Okay!"  Then he added, "I’m happy for you!  I'll give all these jewels to my daughter, Sita."

After King Janaka left, Rama spoke to his uncle, Yudajita.  He said, "My kingdom is yours! Your father must miss you. Please go home! Lakshmana will go with you. Here are some gifts."

Yudajita said, "Thank you, but you keep the gifts!" He bowed to Rama and left with Lakshmana.

Then Rama hugged his friend, the King of Kashi, and said, "Thank you for helping me and Bharata. Go back to your beautiful city!"

Rama hugged his friend for a long time, and then he let him go.  Rama was happy to see all his friends go home safely.

Next, Rama talked to the hundred kings who had helped him. He said, "You were all so brave and loyal!  You helped me defeat the bad Ravana.  It was your strength that won the battle. I was just lucky to be there.  It’s time for you to go home now."

The kings were very happy. They said, "We're so glad you won, Rama!  We’re happy Sita is back! It was our honor to help you!"  They bowed to Rama and promised to always remember him.

Rama said, "Goodbye!" The kings were so happy to go home.  They bowed to Rama again and went back to their kingdoms.
