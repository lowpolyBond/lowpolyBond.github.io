While Rama lay in sorrow deep,
And Lakshmana his watch did keep,
Vibhishaṇ, wise and bold in might,
Approached the scene, a grievous sight.

With warriors four, their weapons gleamed,
Like elephants, they onward streamed,
To Lakshmana, who with tears did weep,
And monkeys mourned in sorrow's sweep.

Rama, great-souled, in sorrow lay,
On Lakshmana's lap, in a swoon's display,
Vibhishaṇ, distressed and kind of heart,
Inquired of Rama, what tore him apart.

"O Ruler of men," he gently said,
"What's happened here, what cause of dread?
For Hanuman's words, I find it queer,
That Sita's death we ought to fear."

Lakshmana, with tears like rain did speak,
In words of meaning, his voice did seek,
"O Gentle Sir, Hanuman's news was dire,
It caused Rama's heart to burn with fire.

But ere I could tell the tale complete,
You intervene, our fate to meet.
What Hanuman spoke, we can't ignore,
But it's hard to believe Sita's no more."

Vibhishaṇ spoke with wisdom's grace,
Explaining the doubts that did embrace,
"My Lord," he said, "Ravana's plan,
Was never to harm Sita, understand.

Though I beseeched him to set her free,
He ignored my words, as you can see.
Neither by conciliation nor by strife,
Could we hope to bring her back to life.

Indrajit, by cunning and deceit,
Foolish monkeys did so mistreat,
The Sita you heard of, was but a shade,
An illusory image, a trick well-played.

Indrajit, with his magic skill,
Sought to deceive, to work his will.
But now, he'll go to Nikumbhila's shrine,
To pour oblations, a rite divine.

When he returns from that sacred fire,
His strength and power will soar still higher.
So, my Lord, cast off this needless pain,
For Sita's loss is not in vain.

With courage high, stay here, I pray,
Send Lakshmana with us today.
His fiery arrows, swift as the wind,
Will make Indrajit's life rescind.

Like birds of prey, his arrows will fly,
And drink the demon's blood, oh my!
So, give us leave, do not delay,
Let Lakshmana go, our foe to slay.

Delay no more, the enemy's near,
Let Lakshmana's arrows strike with fear.
As Indra wields his thunderbolt's might,
Let Lakshmana end this dreadful fight.

For if Indrajit completes his vile rite,
He'll vanish from sight, a ghostly sprite.
The gods themselves will quake with dread,
So let Lakshmana go, the foe to shred."
