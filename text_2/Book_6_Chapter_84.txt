Rama was very sad.  His brother Lakshmana tried to comfort him.  Just then, Bibishana arrived.  He was a powerful warrior, and four strong guards walked with him.

Bibishana saw Rama and the monkeys looking very upset.  He asked, "What's wrong?"

Lakshmana said, "Hanuman told us that Indrajit killed Sita!" Rama was heartbroken.

But Bibishana said, "That's not true! Indrajit is a clever magician. He tricked you! Sita is safe. He only pretended to kill her to make you sad and weak."

Bibishana explained that Indrajit was going to a special ceremony.  After the ceremony, he'd be super strong.  Bibishana said, "We need to stop Indrajit *before* the ceremony!"

Bibishana told Rama, "Don't be sad!  Be brave! Let Lakshmana go fight Indrajit right now!  We can win!"  He encouraged Rama to be strong and lead his army to victory.  Rama, listening to Bibishana's wise words, felt his hope return.
