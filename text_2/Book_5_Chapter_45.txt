Seven strong warriors, shiny and bright like fire, marched out of the palace.  They were like the best fighters ever!  They rode in golden chariots pulled by horses, making a loud BOOM like thunder.  They were ready for a big fight.

But their moms and friends were worried.  They knew the warriors were going to fight Hanuman, a very strong monkey.

The warriors zoomed towards Hanuman in their chariots.  They shot so many arrows, it was like a rain of arrows!  Hanuman was almost hidden behind all those arrows.

But Hanuman was super fast and clever! He jumped and dodged all the arrows. He was so quick, he looked like a playful god dancing among the clouds.

Then he ROARED!  The sound scared the warriors.  Hanuman jumped and fought! He punched, kicked, and even used his nails!  He was so strong, he knocked them down!

The warriors fell, and their army ran away, scared.  Elephants trumpeted, horses fell, and chariots crashed.  Blood flowed like rivers.  It was a very scary mess!

Hanuman, still strong and brave, stood at the gate again. He was ready to fight more!
