Once upon a time, there was a big battle between some strong giants and brave monkeys.  Two giants were fighting like angry elephants!

Indrajit, a brave giant brother, watched. He had a strong bow and arrow.  He shot many arrows.  *Whoosh!*  The arrows flew, hitting the giants and hurting them badly.

Then, Bibishana, a good giant, and his monkey friends joined the fight. They fought with swords and clubs. Bibishana was like a big elephant, and his friends were like little elephants around him.

Bibishana cheered on the monkeys. He said, "Look!  Almost all the giants are gone!  Indrajit is the only one left.  Fight hard, my friends!" He named many giants who had already been defeated.  He told the monkeys that it wasn't his job to fight his own nephew (Indrajit), but they should defeat Indrajit, to help Rama.


The monkeys were happy. They shouted and clapped. Jambavan, a strong bear, and his friends also joined the battle, throwing rocks and using their claws and teeth.

The monkeys and giants fought really hard. Hanuman, a super strong monkey, even broke off a mountain top to use as a weapon!  Lakshmana, a brave monkey warrior, fought Indrajit. They fought and fought, shooting lots and lots of arrows.  It was a whirlwind of arrows! It was so fast, nobody could see what was happening!

Lakshmana hit Indrajit, and Indrajit hit Lakshmana. It was a very close fight. The sun set, and the ground was covered in blood.  Even the magical beings were scared!

Lakshmana shot four arrows and killed Indrajit's horses. Then, with one big powerful throw, he killed Indrajit's driver.  Indrajit had to fight on foot now, and even though he was good, he was tired.

The monkeys jumped on Indrajit's horses, and the horses fell down dead.  Indrajitâ€™s chariot was broken.

Indrajit, now on foot, still fought bravely, but he was surrounded and defeated.  The battle was over! The monkeys won!
