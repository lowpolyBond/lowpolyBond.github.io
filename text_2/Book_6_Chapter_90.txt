In Lanka's dire and fateful fray,
Indrajit stood, prepared to slay.
His horses fell, but spirits soared,
Two warriors fierce, their bows outpoured.

Like elephants in forest wide,
In combat's clash, they'd not divide.
Demons and monkeys, fierce they'd meet,
Each side in battle, heart's swift beat.

Indrajit, with a vengeful blaze,
His demons cheered, their voices raised.
In darkness shrouded, none could see,
Friend from foe, in this melee.

"Fight on, brave demons," Indrajit cried,
"To stupefy the monkeys, stride by stride.
I'll return with a chariot new,
Keep them at bay, that's all you must do."

With trickery, he left the field,
Leaving demons to a fate concealed.
Preparing chariot, sleek and gold,
Armed to conquer, fierce and bold.

He rode back out, troops by his side,
From Lanka's gates, they didn't hide.
Lakshmana, Vibhishaṇ stood,
As Indrajit came, with war's full mood.

Seeing his nephew, Indrajit wise,
Lakshmana and monkeys, much surprised.
With skills and swiftness, both in flight,
They clashed in darkness, fierce their fight.

Lakshmana's arrows pierced the night,
Striking demons left and right.
Indrajit, with anger's art,
Sent deadly arrows, aiming for heart.

Their bodies stained, both fierce and red,
Like Kimshuka trees, in blood they tread.
Warriors true, their minds were set,
Each other's limbs, with arrows met.

In battle's dance, they danced and jousted,
Arrows flew, and shields were busted.
They pierced each other, skilled and keen,
In this epic, bloodied scene.

Vibhishaṇ felt Indrajit's might,
Three arrows struck, a painful sight.
With demons' death, the battlefield cried,
Seeking refuge, by Lakshmana's side.

Indrajit, enraged, not to be deterred,
Lakshmana's bow, he quickly curbed.
Yet another bow, swift he drew,
Lakshmana matched him, arrow true.

Lakshmana tore, with skill and grace,
The bows of Indrajit, a fierce embrace.
Holding his ground, not one to yield,
Indrajit summoned his unconquered shield.

From this shield, a dart he hurled,
A deadly weapon, in battle world.
Lakshmana countered, took his aim,
With a dart of his own, to claim.

With clashes loud, and sparks that flew,
A fiery dance, these heroes knew.
A fierce battle, raged so high,
Arrows and darts filled the sky.

With strength unmatched, they fought with will,
Till Indrajit's fate, the skies did fill.
A charioteer's head, a fatal blow,
Lakshmana struck, in that deadly show.

Horses ran, driverless, wild,
As if by some invisible child.
Indrajit, undaunted, sought revenge,
Striking Lakshmana, a challenge he'd avenge.

Ten arrows strong, his foe did feel,
With pain and force, their impact real.
But Lakshmana, shielded well,
From Indrajit's arrows, none could quell.

Three arrows pierced, Lakshmana's brow,
Like three peaks, they stood, somehow.
With courage unbroken, he fought the tide,
As Indrajit struck, on every side.

The battle raged, with blood and might,
Both warriors fierce, in the dark of night.
Arrows flew, their limbs they'd shred,
In this duel, where life was led.

Then Vibhishaṇ felt Indrajit's ire,
Three arrows struck, his face on fire.
Monkeys and chiefs, with arrows stung,
By Indrajit's fury, their ranks were wrung.

Lakshmana, filled with a warrior's pride,
Fought off the arrows, none could hide.
Indrajit's darts, like snakes did hiss,
But Lakshmana's shield, no harm would miss.

A charioteer's fate, by Lakshmana's hand,
Struck down by Bhalla, in Lanka's land.
Horses unguided, they ran in a ring,
A wonder to see, in this deadly swing.

Impatient now, Indrajit sought to throw,
A javelin, to strike a fearsome blow.
But Lakshmana's aim, his javelin cut,
Into ten pieces, like a lightning strut.

With skill and grace, these warriors strove,
In a battle of strength and fiery love.
Till Indrajit, with a sinister leer,
Seized a deadly arrow, filled with fear.

From his bow, a blazing hammer flew,
Darts and maces, swords and axes too.
Lakshmana blocked it, with skill untold,
With Maheswara's missile, he stood bold.

With weapons fierce, and strength they'd claim,
Their arrows clashed, in a fiery flame.
Arrows flew, and sparks did rise,
In this deadly dance, under darkened skies.

With a missile of Indra, Lakshmana fought,
While Indrajit's Rudra missile sought.
In fiery combat, their arrows met,
A cosmic battle, no one could forget.

Then Agni's missile, in Indrajit's hand,
A deadly weapon, like fire's brand.
Lakshmana countered, with the sun's bright might,
Their missiles clashed, in the dark of night.

Their arrows collided, a thunderous sound,
Fires sparked, as they hit the ground.
A fierce display, as arrows burned,
In this battle, none could be turned.

With strength unmatched, they faced the test,
Lakshmana and Indrajit, both the best.
With arrows sharp, their fight did grow,
In the deadly dance, under night's dark flow.

Then Lakshmana, with purpose clear,
Fitted a missile, no foe could bear.
With a prayer to Indra, he took his aim,
To end this battle, and win the game.

The arrow flew, a fiery dart,
Piercing Indrajit's valiant heart.
With armor breached, and spirits low,
Indrajit fell, his final foe.

With Indrajit's fall, the world found peace,
The oppressor gone, their troubles ceased.
The sky cleared, and waters too,
Rejoicing, as the dawn broke through.

Celestials cheered, with voices loud,
In the sky, they sang, a joyous crowd.
Flowers rained down, in sweet embrace,
As Indrajit's end, brought a sacred grace.

The world, at last, was free from fear,
With Indrajit's fall, the victory clear.
Lakshmana stood, his mission won,
As the battle's end, greeted the sun.

The monkeys roared, with victory claimed,
Their courage and strength, in battle named.
Vibhishaṇ, Hanuman, Jambavan stood,
In awe of Lakshmana, the hero good.

With rejoiced minds, they embraced with cheer,
Lakshmana, their friend, held so dear.
In this epic tale, of battle's might,
Victorious was Lakshmana, in the dark of night.
