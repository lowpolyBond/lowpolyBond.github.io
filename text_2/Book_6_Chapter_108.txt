Ravana, the ten-headed king, zoomed along in his awesome chariot! It was huge and shiny, like a magical flying palace, pulled by strong black horses.  It was filled with weapons and flags, and it looked amazing.

Rama saw Ravana's chariot coming. It was fast and noisy, like a mountain falling!  Rama's own chariot driver, Matali, was super-skilled.  Rama told Matali, "Get ready! Let's fight!" Matali, who was used to driving even faster chariots for the gods, sped up even more.  He zoomed past Ravana, kicking up a cloud of dust!

Ravana was furious! He shot arrows at Rama.  But Rama, strong and brave, used his amazing bow and arrows, which shone like the sun!  They fought like two mighty lions!

Suddenly, everyone came to watch â€“ gods, magical creatures, and wise saints! They wanted to see Ravana get defeated.

Then, scary things started to happen!  The wind howled.  Vultures circled Ravana's chariot.  The sun looked strange and scary.  Even Ravana's own army was scared!  It seemed like bad luck for Ravana.

For Rama, it was all good luck! He saw these bad signs for Ravana as a sign of victory!  He was happy and ready to fight even harder. Rama knew he was going to win!
