Matali, Rama's charioteer, said, "Rama, why are you waiting? You're so strong! Use Brahma's special arrow to defeat Ravana!  It's his time to go!"

Rama grabbed a super-powerful arrow!  It was a gift from a wise man named Agastya. This arrow was so amazing, it never missed! It was made long ago by Brahma himself, the creator of the world.  It was so big it looked like a mountain!  It hissed like a snake and was as bright as the sun! It could break anything â€“ even rocks!  It was scary and powerful, covered in the blood of many enemies.

This arrow was made to defeat Ravana. It made everyone afraid. Rama put the arrow on his bow.  When he got ready, the earth shook!  He pulled back his bow and *whoosh*!  The arrow flew like lightning, straight into Ravana's chest!

Ravana fell from his chariot.  He was dead!  Ravana's army was scared and ran away.  The monkeys cheered! They were happy Rama had won!  Flowers rained down from the sky!  Gods in heaven sang Rama's praises.  The world was happy again!

The wind stopped blowing so hard, the earth stopped shaking, and the sun shone brightly.  Sugriva, Bibishana, Angada, and Lakshmana hugged Rama.  They were so proud of him! Rama looked as mighty as the King of the Gods!
