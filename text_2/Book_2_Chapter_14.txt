Once upon a time, in the kingdom of Ayodhya, King Dasharatha was very sad.  His wife, Kaikeyi, saw him looking upset.  She reminded him of a promise: he had promised her two wishes.

Kaikeyi said, "King, why are you so sad?  You promised me two wishes!  Being truthful is very important.  Good kings always keep their promises.  I want you to keep yours." She told him stories of other kings who kept their promises, even if it was hard.

Kaikeyi’s wish was for Rama, the king's eldest son, to go far away to live in the forest.  She said she wouldn't live if he didn't do this.  The king was heartbroken, but he felt he had to grant her wish.

The king was very, very unhappy. He felt like a strong bull pulled in two directions. He didn’t want to send Rama away. He even said he'd rather die than make Rama leave.

The next morning, everyone was excited!  It was the day Rama was supposed to become king. The streets were clean and pretty, with flowers everywhere. Everyone was happy and celebrating.

But the king was still sad.  A wise man named Vasishtha came to the palace, bringing everything needed for Rama's coronation ceremony.  He brought beautiful things:  flowers, animals, and even a white elephant!

Vasishtha’s helper, Sumantra, came to wake the king and tell him everything was ready for Rama's coronation.  But the king was still too sad to do anything. He told Sumantra how upset he was.

Then, Kaikeyi told Sumantra to go get Rama.  She said the king was just tired and needed to see Rama.  Sumantra didn’t know anything was wrong, so he went to get Rama, thinking the king just wanted to see him before the coronation.  Poor Sumantra!  He didn't know what was coming.
