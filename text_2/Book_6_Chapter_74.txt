The monkey army was sad. Rama and Lakshmana, two brave princes, lay still on the battlefield.  Sugriva, Jambavan, and all the other monkey leaders were scared. They didn't know what to do.

But Vibhishana, a wise monkey, spoke up.  "Don't worry!" he said. "Rama and Lakshmana were hurt by a magic weapon.  It's a very powerful weapon, given by a god.  They allowed themselves to be hurt to show respect to the god. This isn't the time to give up!"

Hanuman, the strongest monkey, agreed. "Let's help the other monkeys," he said.

Hanuman and Vibhishana used torches to look around.  The battlefield was terrible!  Many monkeys were hurt.  Parts of bodies lay everywhere.  Even huge, mountain-sized monkeys were lying still.

They found Sugriva, Angada, Jambavan, and many, many more monkeys.  Millions of monkeys were hurt by the magic weapon!

Hanuman and Vibhishana found Jambavan, a very old, brave bear.  He was hurt by many arrows.

"Are you okay?" Hanuman asked.

Jambavan, weak but brave, asked, "Is Hanuman still alive?"

Vibhishana said, "Why do you ask about Hanuman?  What about Rama and Lakshmana?"

Jambavan said, "If Hanuman is alive, there's still hope!  He's so strong!"

Just then, Hanuman came closer.  Jambavan felt stronger seeing him.

Jambavan told Hanuman, "Only you can save us! Go to a faraway mountain, Mount Kailash.  There's a special mountain with magical plants. You must get four of them: Mritasamjivani (to bring back life!), Vishalyakarani (to heal wounds!), Suvarnakarani (to heal skin!), and Sandhani (to make a special medicine!)."

Hanuman felt very strong. He jumped!  He ran so fast that the mountain shook! He even made Lanka, the city of the enemy, shake!

Hanuman leaped across the ocean! He flew like the wind.  He saw birds, mountains, rivers, and cities zoom by beneath him.  Finally, he found Mount Kailash.  He looked for the magical plants but they hid!

Angry, Hanuman broke off the top of the mountain!  He flew back with the mountain top, which shone brightly.

The monkeys cheered when they saw him!  Hanuman gave the plants to Rama and Lakshmana.  They were instantly healed!  All the other hurt monkeys were also healed, even the ones who seemed dead.

The monkeys fought back, and the enemy threw many dead and wounded into the sea. Then, Hanuman brought the mountain top back to where it belonged and went to be with Rama again.
