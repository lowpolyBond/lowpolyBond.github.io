When the powerful Rama defeated the mighty Ravana, the giantesses were very sad.  They were like mothers who had lost their babies.  Their hair was messy, and they cried and cried.  They ran onto the battlefield, looking for their king.  "Oh, our King! Our protector!" they wailed, running past headless bodies and blood.  They cried like elephants who had lost their leader.

Then they saw Ravana, their king, lying on the ground. They all rushed to him, like vines falling from a tree.  Some hugged him and cried. Some held his feet. Some just fell to the ground and sobbed. One fainted from sadness.  One laid her head on his lap and cried until her tears wet his face.

They cried, "Our king, who even the gods feared, is dead!  He scared everyone â€“ even the powerful Yama, the god of death! He made everyone tremble, but a human, a simple man, killed him! He couldn't be defeated by gods or demons, but a man on foot defeated him! This is so unfair!"

Ravana's wives sobbed even more. They said, "You didn't listen to your good friend, Bibishana. You took Sita away, and now we are all destroyed! You were mean to Bibishana when he tried to help you.  If you had given Sita back to Rama, none of this would have happened! We wouldn't be widows, and our enemies wouldn't be happy. It was your stubbornness that caused this! But it's destiny, too. Everything that dies is taken by destiny. It's fate that you and the monkeys and giants are all dead now."

The giantesses cried and cried. Their eyes were full of tears. They were heartbroken.
