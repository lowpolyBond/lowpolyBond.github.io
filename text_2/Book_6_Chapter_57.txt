King Ravana was very angry about Akampana's death. He talked to his advisors.  He then checked on Lanka's defenses. The city was decorated with flags and full of soldiers.

Lanka was surrounded by Rama's monkey army! Ravana told his best warrior, Prahasta, "Only you, Kumbhakarna, Indrajit, or Nikumbha can save us! Take some soldiers and attack the monkeys.  They're noisy and silly.  They'll run away when they hear your army! Then we'll catch Rama and his brother, Lakshmana!"

Prahasta was a loyal soldier. He said, "King, we talked about this. Giving back Sita would have been best, but now we must fight. I'll do anything for you! I'll fight even if it means losing my life!"

Prahasta told his officers to gather a huge army.  He said, "Today, the birds and animals will feast on our enemies!"

Soon, Lanka was full of soldiers! They prayed and prepared for battle. They put on beautiful garlands and climbed into their chariots.  Prahasta's chariot was amazingâ€”shiny and golden! It looked like a giant cloud!

Prahasta's army marched out with loud drums and horns. It was a scary sound!  His friends, Narantaka, Kumbhakarna, Mahanada, and Samunata, marched beside him.  He looked like Death himself!

But strange things started to happen!  Birds circled his chariot.  Jackals howled and spat fire! A shooting star fell! The wind blew cold.  Even the chariot's horses stumbled!  A bad omen!  A vulture landed on his flag!

The monkey army was ready! They shouted and swung their clubs and threw rocks.  Both armies roared and screamed.  Prahasta rushed into the battle, like a grasshopper jumping into a fire!
