Once upon a time, a giant named Kumbhakarna was sleeping.  He was HUGE and strong, like a lion! Thousands of people watched as he woke up and walked to his brother Ravana's palace.  Flowers rained down on him as he went.

Ravana's palace was HUGE and shiny, like the sun poking through clouds.  Kumbhakarna walked inside and saw his brother Ravana looking worried. Ravana was happy to see Kumbhakarna and rushed to hug him. Kumbhakarna sat down on a big, fancy throne.  His eyes were angry!

“Why did you wake me?” he grumbled. “Who are you so scared of?”

Ravana explained, "A hero named Rama, and his monkey friends, have come to Lanka! They built a bridge across the ocean!  They're super strong and they're beating my army!  Please help me!  Only you are strong enough to defeat them!”  Ravana was very worried.  He begged Kumbhakarna to fight the monkeys and save Lanka, the city where all the children and old people lived.  He said Kumbhakarna was the strongest warrior ever, and he was his only hope.
