One night, while Shatrughna slept in a simple hut made of leaves, Sita had twin baby boys!  The young helpers rushed to tell the wise Valmiki.  "Great Valmiki," they said, "Sita has twins! Please bless them to keep them safe!"

Valmiki hurried to see the babies. They were bright and strong, just like little gods!  He was so happy!  He used special magic and some long grass to protect them. He said, "We'll rub the first baby with this grass, so we'll call him Kusha.  The helpers will dry the second baby with the grass, so he'll be called Lava."

The helpers carefully used the grass on the babies.  Shatrughna heard the good news â€“ Sita had twins named Kusha and Lava! He went to see Sita and said, "Mother, I'm so happy for you!"

Shatrughna had a wonderful night. The next morning, he prayed, said goodbye to Valmiki, and went on his journey.  He walked for seven days. He reached a river called the Yamuna and stopped at another special place with other wise people. He listened to their amazing stories and talked with them for a long time.  Shatrughna was very happy.
