King Rama was a good ruler.  He was kind and fair. After he said goodbye to his brother Shatrughna, Rama ruled his kingdom happily.

One day, a sad old farmer came to the palace. He was a Brahmin, and he held his dead baby in his arms. He cried and cried.  "Why did this happen?" he sobbed.  "What bad thing did I do in my past life to deserve this?"

The farmer was heartbroken. He kept saying, "My son! My son! He was so young! He hadn't even turned fourteen!  My wife and I will die of sadness too. I've always been good. I never lied. I never hurt anyone or any animal. Why did my son die so young?  This never happened before Rama became king!  Only under your rule do children die so young!  Other kingdoms are safe. Please, King Rama, bring my son back to life!  Then my wife and I will die peacefully.  You'll be happy, but we are so sad. Your kingdom is usually happy and safe.  Now, it's sad and scary. If children are dying, it means something is wrong.  You must be the reason!"

The poor father cried and cried, holding his dead baby close. He blamed Rama for his son's death. He said many sad things to the king.
