Hanuman sat down on some soft grass.  Prince Bharata was so happy to hear news of his brother, Rama!  He asked Hanuman lots of questions.

"Hanuman," said Bharata, "I'm so glad to hear from Rama after all these years!  Tell me everything! How did Rama and the monkeys become friends? What happened?"

Hanuman began his story: "You know about Rama's exile, right?  Because of a promise to your mother.  King Dasaratha, Rama's father, was very sad and died. You came back from Rajagriha, but you refused to be king. You went to see Rama and asked him to be king, but Rama didn't want to.  You brought back Rama's sandals.

But after you left, things got bad in the forest. Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana went to a scary forest. It was full of elephants, lions, and tigers! A giant monster, Viradha, attacked them. Rama and Lakshmana were strong! They beat Viradha and went to a nice hermitage.  Then they went to Janasthana, where Rama fought and killed fourteen thousand demons!

Then, a mean demon woman named Shurpanakha attacked them. Lakshmana cut off her ears and nose!  She ran to tell her brother, Ravana, the terrible king of Lanka.

Ravana sent a magic deer. Sita wanted Rama to catch it.  Rama chased the deer and killed it. While he was gone, Ravana kidnapped Sita! A big bird, Jatayu, tried to help, but Ravana killed him.  Ravana took Sita to his palace in Lanka on a magic flying chariot.

Rama was very sad when he found Jatayu dead. He and Lakshmana looked everywhere for Sita.  They met a giant named Kabandha, who told them to find Sugriva, the monkey king. Sugrivaâ€™s brother, Bali, had taken his kingdom. Rama helped Sugriva get his kingdom back by defeating Bali.  Sugriva promised to help find Sita.

Many monkeys searched for Sita. I, Hanuman, flew across the ocean! I found Sita in Ravana's garden. She was sad, but she was still faithful to Rama. I gave her a ring from Rama. Then I flew back to tell Rama.

Rama was so happy! He built a bridge to Lanka with the help of the monkeys.  There was a big battle!  Rama and his army defeated Ravana's army. Rama killed Ravana!  They rescued Sita, and everyone celebrated. Rama returned home.

Tomorrow, you can see Rama near the Ganges River."

Bharata was overjoyed. "Finally!" he said. "My wish has come true!"
