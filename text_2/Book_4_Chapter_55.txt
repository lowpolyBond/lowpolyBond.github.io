Hanuman talked to Angada. He spoke kindly and wisely about Sugriva, their king.  But Angada was sad.  He didn't trust Sugriva.

"Sugriva isn't good," Angada said. "He married his older brother's wife! That's wrong. He trapped his brother in a cave! He's ungrateful to Rama, who helped him so much. Sugriva only wants to be king. He'll hurt me if I go back!"

Angada was afraid Sugriva would put him in jail. He didn't want to live like that.  "I'd rather die," he said. "Tell Rama and the others I'm okay. Tell my mom and my adopted mom I love them.  I'm going to stay here and not eat until I die."

Angada bowed his head and sadly sat down on some grass.  Many monkeys felt sad too. They cried. They didn't like Sugriva either. They sat down beside Angada and said they would also stop eating until they died.  

They remembered all the sad things that happened: Rama being sent away, their father King Dasaratha dying, many monkeys being killed, Jatayu dying to save Sita, Bali dying, and Rama's anger. They were very scared and sad.  The whole place echoed with their cries.  It sounded like thunder.
