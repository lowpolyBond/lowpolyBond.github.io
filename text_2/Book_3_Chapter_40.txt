King Ravana was planning a sneaky plan to get Sita, Rama's wife.  His friend Marica tried to warn him, saying it was a bad idea.  But Ravana was angry!

"Your advice is useless!" he roared.  "I'm going to fight Rama! He's weak and unimportant. I'll take Sita right in front of you!"

Ravana didn't listen to Marica's good advice. He said he was a powerful king, like a god. He didn't need anyone to tell him what to do.

Ravana gave Marica a terrible job. "Turn into a beautiful golden deer," he ordered. "Lure Sita away from Rama and Lakshmana.  When they chase you, I'll grab Sita!"

Ravana promised Marica half his kingdom if the plan worked.  But he threatened to kill Marica if she refused.  Marica was scared, but she knew she had to do what Ravana said.  It was a terrible plan, but Ravana was very powerful and scary.
