Once upon a time, a mean demon named Maricha escaped from a fight with Rama.  He told Ravana, a powerful king of demons, his story.

Maricha said, "I tricked Rama before! Then, with two other demons, I went to a forest. We scared the wise people who lived there. I was very mean. I even ate them!"

Maricha continued, "I saw Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana in the forest.  They were very good and kind.  I was angry because Rama had beaten me before. So I charged at Rama with my horns, wanting to hurt him."

"But Rama is super-fast and strong! He shot three amazing arrows!  My friends died, but I ran away! I was so scared! Now, even the sound of Rama's name scares me! I see him everywhere!  Even in my dreams!"

"Rama is so brave and strong, he defeated even Bali and Namuchi, who were very powerful demons.  Ravana, you can't beat Rama.  Please, don't fight him! If you do, we will all be in danger.  Please listen to me!"

Maricha warned Ravana, "Rama already killed a mean demon named Khara because Khara's sister was mean to Sita. Rama is a good warrior, but Khara started it. Don't fight Rama, Ravana! You'll lose!"
