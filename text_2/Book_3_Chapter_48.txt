A grumpy giant named Ravana saw Sita.  He was very, very strong! He boasted, "I'm Ravana, brother of the rich Kuvera!  Even the gods are scared of me! I stole Kuvera's amazing flying chariot! I rule Lanka, a city filled with treasures and magic!  It's even better than the gods' city!  Come live with me, Sita! Forget that Rama, he's just a man. He's weak and lost his kingdom.  I'm powerful, and I love you!"

Sita was angry!  She bravely shouted back, "You call yourself Kuvera's brother?  You're cruel and mean!  You've stolen and hurt others.  Anyone who takes Rama's wife will be punished! You may have hurt others, but you will never hurt me or get away with this!"
