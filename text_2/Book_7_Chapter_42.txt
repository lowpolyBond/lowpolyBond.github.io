Rama and Sita's Happy Time

Rama arrived at a beautiful garden.  It was full of amazing trees! There were mango trees, and trees with flowers that smelled sweet.  Pretty birds sang in the trees.  The garden had sparkling pools with lily pads floating on the water.  It was even more beautiful than a king's palace!

Rama sat on a fancy throne with Sita beside him. He gave Sita some yummy honey wine.  They ate delicious fruits and watched dancers perform.  Beautiful fairies danced and sang for them. Rama and Sita were very happy.

Days turned into weeks.  They played and enjoyed the beautiful garden. Then spring came again!

One day, Rama went to work. Sita prayed to the gods and then put on her prettiest jewels.  She looked like a princess from the sky!  She went to see Rama.

Rama was so happy to see her.  He asked Sita, "My dear Sita, you are going to have a baby!  What can I do to make you happy?"

Sita smiled. "I want to visit the wise holy people who live near the Ganges River," she said. "They live simply, eating only fruits and roots. I want to meet them."

Rama said, "Of course, my love! Tomorrow, we will go."  Then Rama went to talk to his friends.
