Hanuman the monkey was searching for Sita in Ravana's palace. He looked everywhere! He checked the bedrooms, the gardens, even the secret hiding places.  But he couldn't find her.

Hanuman felt sad.  He thought, "Maybe Sita is gone.  Maybe Ravana hurt her because she was so brave and loyal to Rama.  What will I tell everyone back home?  I crossed the ocean, but I failed!"

He felt like giving up.  He thought about going home and facing his friends. They would be so disappointed.  Heâ€™d worked so hard!

But then Hanuman remembered something important:  "Never give up!" he told himself. "Keep trying!"

So Hanuman searched again.  He looked in every corner, every room, even under the palace!  He saw scary monsters and beautiful women, but still no Sita.

He saw scary giant women and beautiful snake women who were also prisoners of Ravana, but not Sita.  He was very upset.

Hanuman was so tired and sad. He had crossed a huge ocean to find Sita, and he hadn't succeeded.  He felt like a failure. He climbed down from the flying chariot, his heart heavy with worry.  He still had to keep searching.
