Rama and his brother Lakshmana, and his wife Sita, went to a beautiful forest called Pancavati.  It was full of deer and other animals.

Rama said to Lakshmana, "Let's find a good place to build our home here.  It should be near a pond, with lots of flowers and grass."

Lakshmana said, "I'll do whatever you want, Rama!"

Rama found a perfect spot! It was flat and surrounded by lovely trees. A pretty river, the Godavari, flowed nearby. It was full of colorful lotuses and birds.  Peacocks called, and hills looked like giant elephants!

There were so many trees â€“ Sala, Tala, and many more! The forest was full of deer and birds.  Even Jatayu, a giant bird, lived nearby!

Lakshmana quickly built a nice home. It had walls of mud and a roof made of leaves and grass.  He even gathered pretty lotuses from the river.

When Rama and Sita saw the new home, they were very happy. Rama hugged Lakshmana and said, "You did a wonderful job, brother!"

Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana lived happily in their new home in the forest, just like gods in the sky. They had plenty of fruit to eat.
