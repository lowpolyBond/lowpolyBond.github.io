Hearing that roar, like thunderbolts on high,
The monkeys fled, fear flashing in each eye.
Hanuman, son of wind, spoke clear and bold,
"Why run, dear brothers, where's your courage, old?

Stand by my side, let's face this fearsome fray,
Our noble birth commands we do not sway.
For valour's flame still burns within our hearts,
To flee this fight is not how heroes play."

His words struck chords of courage, hearts revived,
The monkeys rallied, to their chief they dived.
With rocks and trees, they charged the demon foe,
As flames consume, their power began to show.

With mighty boulders hurled, they sought to crush,
Indrajit's chariot, with a fearsome rush.
But demons swift, with horses, chariot, fled,
The stones struck earth, not him they left for dead.

Undaunted, monkeys roared, their battle cry,
Like Yama's wrath when worlds begin to die.
They pummeled foes, with fury unrestrained,
As Hanuman's force a path of death maintained.

A massive rock, at Indrajit was flung,
His horses fled, their speedy hooves were sprung.
The missile split, not reached its marked intent,
But demons near were crushed, their bodies rent.

In rage, Indrajit charged forth once more,
A hail of arrows through the sky he'd pour.
His demons, armed with weapons keen and bright,
Joined in the fight, fierce as the darkest night.

Yet Hanuman stood tall amidst the fray,
Defying demon force, come what may.
With trees and rocks, his brethren joined the dance,
A wild, relentless, all-consuming trance.

They battered demons, twisted in their pain,
Who writhed and rolled, but could not break the chain.
Indrajit, too, fought fiercely, undeterred,
In battle's rage, where warriors' fates were stirred.

Amidst the chaos, Hanuman's voice rang clear,
"Retreat," he cried, dispelling doubt and fear.
"Our Sita's fate, by cruel hands, is sealed,
Inform our lord, let sorrow be revealed."

Thus spoke Hanuman, leading them away,
To where great Rama waited, dawn of day.
Indrajit sought refuge, altar-bound,
Pouring oblations on that sacred ground.

The flames arose, with crimson tongues they licked,
The offering consumed, the demons' hopes tricked.
Indrajit, well-versed in dark rites and lore,
Stood strong with demons, ready for the war.
