The monkeys heard a HUGE roar!  It was Ravana, and his voice was like thunder!  Scared, the monkeys ran in all directions.

But Hanuman, a super-strong monkey, shouted, "Why are you running?  Don't be scared! Follow me!"

The monkeys felt brave again. They picked up rocks and trees and fought back!  Hanuman fought like a super hero, surrounded by his monkey friends. He fought so bravely, he seemed to be everywhere at once, hitting the enemy hard.  He even threw a giant rock at Ravana's chariot! The chariot swerved just in time!

Then the monkeys threw trees and rocks at the enemy. It was a crazy battle!  The enemy soldiers fell everywhere.

But then, a strong enemy warrior named Indrajita fought back. He shot lots of arrows and hurt many monkeys.  The monkeys fought back with spears, swords, and even giant tree branches! Hanuman used huge tree trunks like giant clubs.

After pushing back the enemy, Hanuman told his monkey army, "We fought hard for Sita, but she might be dead!  We need to tell Rama and Sugriva."  Hanuman and his brave monkeys went home.

Indrajita wanted to pray. He went to a special fire altar and made a big fire offering. The fire burned bright, like the sunset.  Then, he made another offering to the earth. All the enemy soldiers watched.
