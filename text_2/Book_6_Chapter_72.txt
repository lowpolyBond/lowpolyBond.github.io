King Ravana was very upset.  His best fighters were dead!  Lakshmana, Rama's brother, had killed Atikaya.  Then, many more of Ravana's strong warriors – Dhumraksha, Akampana, Prahasta, and even the giant Kumbhakarna – had been defeated by Rama and his monkey army.  Even Ravana's son, Indrajita, a very powerful warrior, had captured Rama and Lakshmana, but somehow they escaped!

Ravana worried.  All his strongest soldiers were gone.  He didn't know who could beat Rama and his friends. Rama was so strong! His arrows flew far and fast.  Every warrior who fought Rama had lost!

"We need to protect Sita!" Ravana shouted. Sita was a princess he had captured. "Guards, watch the city walls! Watch the Ashoka Grove where Sita is kept.  Watch everywhere, day and night!  Watch the monkeys! See where they go, and stop them!"

Ravana's soldiers hurried off to follow his orders.  But Ravana stayed behind, feeling sad and angry. He missed his son, and he was afraid Rama would win. He sighed and sighed, his heart heavy with worry.
