Rama, a kind prince, was leaving his kingdom to live in the forest.  He sent Lakshmana to tell a wise holy man, Rishi Suyajna, to come say goodbye.

Lakshmana told the holy man, and they went to Rama's beautiful palace. Rama and his wife, Sita, greeted the holy man with gifts!  They gave him beautiful jewelry, a comfy bed, and even an elephant named Shatranjaya!

Rama was very generous. He also gave lots of gifts to his friends and teachers. He gave them cows, gold, silver, and beautiful clothes. He even gave gifts to his servants! He wanted everyone to be happy.  He told Lakshmana to give lots of gifts to everyone he knew and helped him, especially to holy men.

Rama's servants were sad he was leaving. Rama gave them lots of money to help them while he was gone.  Rama also gave money to old people, sick people, and anyone who needed help.

A poor man named Trijata lived in the forest with his family.  His wife told him to ask Rama for help.  Trijata went to Rama's palace.

Trijata was very poor. He told Rama about his struggles. Rama smiled and said, "Throw your stick as far as you can.  I'll give you as many cows as can stand between you and where the stick lands!"

Trijata threw his stick. It landed on the other side of the river! Thousands of cows were grazing there! Rama gave all those cows to Trijata.  He said, "I wanted to see how strong your faith was."

Trijata was very happy.  He thanked Rama and went home with his new cows.  Rama gave away all his remaining riches to everyone he could. He made sure everyone had something before he went into the forest. He wanted to be remembered for his kindness.
