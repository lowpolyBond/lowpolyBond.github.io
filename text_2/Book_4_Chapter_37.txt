Sugriva, the monkey king, spoke to Hanuman. "Hanuman," he said, "call all the monkeys!  Call the monkeys from the tall mountains – Mahendra, Himavat, Vindhya, Kailasha, and Mandara! Call the monkeys from Mount Pandu and the Five Hills! Call the monkeys who live by the sea and near the sun! Call the strong monkeys from the Pad-machalu woods! Call the monkeys from Anjana Hill, strong as elephants! Call the golden monkeys from Mahashaila! Call the monkeys from Mount Meru and Mount Dhumra! Call the monkeys from Maharuna Mountain who drink Maireya wine!  Call all the monkeys from every forest and every place!"

Sugriva said, "Use gifts and kind words.  I already sent some fast monkeys. Send more to hurry them along!  Even the lazy monkeys must come! If they don't come in ten days, they'll be in big trouble!  Tell all my monkeys to come quickly – hundreds, thousands, millions of them!"

Hanuman, the Wind God's son, quickly sent groups of smart monkeys in every direction.  The monkeys ran and flew, searching everywhere. They went across seas, mountains, forests, and lakes.

When the monkeys heard Sugriva’s order, they were scared and rushed to Kishkindha. Millions and millions of monkeys came! Black monkeys from Mount Anjana came. Golden monkeys from the sunset hills came.  Monkeys from Mount Kailasha came. Monkeys from Himavat came.  Many, many monkeys came from the Vindhya mountains.  So many monkeys came from the sea, the Tamala forests, and everywhere else that nobody could count them all!

The monkeys found a special tree on Mount Himavat.  This tree had magical fruits and roots that made monkeys strong and healthy.  They brought these fruits, roots, and flowers back to Sugriva.

The monkeys quickly returned to Kishkindha.  "King Sugriva," they said, "we found all the monkeys! They're all here!"

Sugriva was very happy. He took the gifts and thanked the monkeys.  Now he had a huge army ready to help Rama!
