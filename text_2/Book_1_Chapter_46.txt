Once upon a time, a sad mother named Diti learned her children had died.  She was very upset!  She went to her husband, Kasyapa, and said, "My husband, I want a strong son who can defeat Indra, the king of the gods! I'll do anything to get him."

Kasyapa said, "Alright, my dear.  If you stay pure and do very hard exercises for a thousand years, you will have a powerful son. He will rule the whole world!"

So Diti went to the forest and started doing very hard exercises.  Indra, the god she wanted to defeat, was actually very kind. He helped her!  He brought her food, water, and even gave her massages when she was tired.  He helped her for almost a thousand years.

Finally, the time came. Diti said to Indra, "Soon, I'll have a son! He will be your brother, and you'll share the world with him."

But then Diti got very sleepy. She fell asleep in a funny positionâ€”with her feet where her head should have been!

Indra saw his chance.  He used his magic weapon to cut the baby in her tummy into seven pieces!  Diti woke up and cried, "No, stop!" But Indra had already done it.

Afterwards, Indra felt bad. He said, "Diti, I'm sorry. Because you were sleeping in that position, your baby was going to be very dangerous. I had to stop him from being born."  And so, the story ends.
