Bali, the mighty monkey king, lay on the ground, hit by Rama's arrow.  His wife, Tara, looked like the moon.  She ran to him and hugged him tight.  Bali looked like a giant elephant hurt by an arrow.  Tara cried and cried.

"My brave husband," she sobbed, "why don't you talk to me? Get up!  Kings don't sleep on the ground! Or is the ground your new bed?  You're such a great warrior, you've probably already made a new, amazing kingdom in the sky!

"Our happy times in the forest are over. I'm so sad. You're leaving me. My heart feels like stone – it should be breaking!  You did wrong, taking Sugriva's wife, and now you're paying for it.

"I always tried to help you, even when you were mean to me. Now, you're leaving me for the beautiful sky ladies.  Even Sugriva couldn't beat you, but fate has won this time. Rama killed you, but he only did what Sugriva asked.

"My poor son Angada!  What will happen to him now? He's so young! Sugriva, you’ve won.  Enjoy your kingdom! But my husband, why don't you speak? Look at all your wives, they are so sad."

All of Bali's wives cried, holding little Angada.  Tara cried again, "Don't leave Angada, my love! He's kind and brave, just like you! If I did anything wrong, please forgive me! I will always love you."

Tara and the other queens cried and cried beside Bali.  Tara was so heartbroken, she decided she would not eat and would stay there with him, ready to die, too.
