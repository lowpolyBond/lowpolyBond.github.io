Rama was very angry. He said harsh words to Sita, his wife.  Sita was so ashamed and sad that she cried.  She had never heard him speak like that before.  Many people were watching.

Sita said, "Rama, why are you so mean to me?  I have always loved you.  I didn't do anything wrong! It wasn't my fault. My heart has always been yours."

She remembered when Rama sent Hanuman, the monkey, to find her in Lanka. "Why didn't you reject me then?" she asked.  "I would have died rather than cause you so much trouble."

Sita was heartbroken. She told Lakshmana, Rama's brother, "Build a fire for me.  I will jump into it to prove I'm innocent.  Rama doesn't believe me, so this is the only way."

Lakshmana was sad, but he knew Rama was very upset. He built the fire.  Nobody dared to stop Rama.  He was like a scary storm.

Sita walked around the fire, and prayed to the gods.  She said, "Gods, please protect me! I am innocent, even though Rama thinks I am not."

Then, Sita jumped into the fire! Everyone watched.  She looked like gold melting in a pot.  The women cried.  The monkeys and giants screamed. It was a very sad sight.
