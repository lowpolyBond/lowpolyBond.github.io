Ravana, the ten-headed king, was very worried.  He had a big army, but he gave it to his friend Khara.  Then he felt much better.

Ravana went to a special forest.  There was a big, shiny ceremony happening!  He saw his son, Meghanada, there.  Meghanada was wearing a black coat and doing a special magic ritual.

Ravana hugged Meghanada and asked, "What are you doing, son?"

A wise man named Ushanas explained, "Your son did many, many special ceremonies!  He got amazing gifts from a powerful god: a super-fast flying chariot, magic to hide in battle, and a super strong bow and arrows!"

Ravana said, "Hmmm, that's not quite right. We shouldn't have done those ceremonies. But it's done now."

Ravana went home with Meghanada and his brother Vibhishana.  They had lots of people trapped.

Vibhishana was worried. He said, "Ravana, we're treating these people badly. We kidnapped them!  And someone even kidnapped *our* cousin Kumbhinasi!"

Ravana was surprised. "Who kidnapped her?" he asked.

Vibhishana said, "Madhu did!  He's very strong! He even killed some of our guards!  It's wrong what we're doing!"

Ravana got very angry.  He said, "We're going to find Madhu!  We'll fight him!"

Ravana took a huge army to find Madhu.  There were elephants, horses, and even flying creatures!  They were ready for battle.  But Vibhishana stayed home.

Ravana found Madhu's city but Madhu wasn't there!  He only found his sister, Kumbhinasi. She was very scared.

Ravana said, "Don't worry! What do you want?"

Kumbhinasi begged him, "Please don't hurt my husband, Madhu!"

Ravana smiled. "I won't hurt him! I want him to join my army!"

Kumbhinasi woke up Madhu.  She was so happy!  Madhu agreed to join Ravana's army.

Ravana spent the night, then he and his huge army marched to a tall mountain. They were ready to fight anyone who stood in their way!
