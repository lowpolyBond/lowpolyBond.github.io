Long, long ago, in a land with seven islands, there was a wonderful kingdom.  Many strong kings ruled it, one after another.

One of these great kings was Sagara. He had sixty thousand sons! They were so strong, they even dug a path through the ocean!  This story is about their family, and it's a very special one.  Listen closely!

In a beautiful country called Koshala, near the Sarayu River, was the amazing city of Ayodhya. It was so beautiful, everyone loved it!  Ayodhya was built a long, long time ago.

King Dasaratha ruled Ayodhya.  He was a kind and powerful king, like a god! Ayodhya was huge! It had tall gates, busy markets, and wonderful houses.  There were musicians playing music, and everyone was happy.  The city was surrounded by trees and flowers, it looked like a pretty girl with a green belt!  It had strong walls, so no enemy could ever get in.  Lots of animals lived there too: elephants, horses, camels, and more!  People from all over came to visit and trade.

Ayodhya was even more beautiful than the gods' city! The palaces sparkled with gold and jewels, and the towers reached up to the sky. The houses were tall and pretty, and everywhere you heard wonderful music.

The warriors of Ayodhya were brave and strong. They were amazing archers, so good they could hit a target just by hearing it!  They were kind tooâ€”they never hurt anyone who ran away. Many had fought tigers and lions to protect their homes.

Ayodhya was full of clever people too. There were teachers, artists, and wise men who knew all about magic and the stars. Everyone in Ayodhya was happy and peaceful.  This is where our story begins!
