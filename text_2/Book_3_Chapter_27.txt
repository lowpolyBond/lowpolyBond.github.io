Khara, the demon king, was about to fight Rama.  But Trishiras, a powerful demon with three heads, stopped him.  "Let me fight Rama first!" he boasted.  "I'll defeat him!  You watch!"

Khara agreed. Trishiras, big and strong like a mountain, zoomed towards Rama in his shiny chariot. He rained down arrows like a storm cloud!

Rama wasn't scared. He shot back!  It was a huge battle!  It looked like a lion fighting an elephant!

Trishiras hit Rama three times on the forehead.  But Rama was angry!  "Those arrows are like a crown on my head!" he shouted.  "Now, take these!"

Whoosh! Rama shot fourteen arrows into Trishiras' chest!  Four more arrows knocked down his horses! Eight more killed his driver! Then, with one last arrow, he chopped off Trishiras' flag!

Trishiras tumbled out of his broken chariot.  Rama shot him again and again.  With a final arrow, he cut off all three of Trishiras' heads!  Blood poured out, and Trishiras fell.

The other demons saw Trishiras die. They were terrified! They ran away like scared deer!  Khara was furious. He tried to stop them, but it was too late. Now, he had to fight Rama alone!
