King Dasaratha ruled Ayodhya. He was a very good king. He had many wise advisors who helped him rule.

Eight of them were extra special!  Their names were Dhristi, Jayanta, Vijaya, Siddhartha, Arthasadhaka, Ashoka, Mantrapala, and Sumantra. They were always busy helping the king. They were honest and kind.

Two very holy wise men, Vasishtha and Vamadeva, also helped the king. They taught him about being good and spiritual.

All the advisors were super good people. They were fair and never did anything wrong. They knew the rules and helped everyone. They were brave but not greedy. They were friends, and even punished their own sons if they did something bad!

They knew about fighting and money. They were smart and never punished anyone unfairly.  They made the kingdom rich without hurting anyone.  They were good to everyone and always peaceful.  They were wise and learned, and talked to each other nicely.

The advisors learned what people needed and helped them. King Dasaratha listened to them. He always did what was right. Everyone knew him as a fair and truthful king. He was the best king in all the land!  He was strong and kind, and Ayodhya was a happy place under his rule.  He was like the sun, shining brightly over his kingdom!
