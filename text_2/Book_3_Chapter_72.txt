Once upon a time, a giant monster named Kabandha was defeated by Rama and Lakshmana.  They burned him in a big fire!  Amazingly, as the fire burned, Kabandha changed! He became a handsome man and flew away in a beautiful swan-drawn chariot.

Before he left, he told Rama a secret to help him find his wife, Sita.  "Rama," he said, "you need a friend to help you. Find a monkey named Sugriva. He's very strong and clever, but his brother Bali is mean and banished him. Sugriva lives on a mountain called Rishyamuka, near Pampa Lake."

Kabandha explained that Sugriva is a great leader of monkeys. He's brave, smart, and loyal.  "Sugriva will help you find Sita," Kabandha promised. "He knows everything! Even if Sita is far away, on a high mountain or deep underground, Sugriva and his monkey friends will find her."

Kabandha told Rama to hurry and make friends with Sugriva.  He said Sugriva can change shape and is very grateful.  If Rama helps Sugriva, Sugriva will definitely help Rama find Sita.  So Rama and Lakshmana knew they had to go and find this amazing monkey king!
