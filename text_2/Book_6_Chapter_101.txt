Ravana, the ten-headed king, was angry!  His first weapon broke.  He wasn't happy.  So he made a new, scary weapon!  He shot it at Rama, but Rama was clever. He used a special arrow and broke Ravana's weapon!

Ravana tried again! This time, he shot many shiny, fiery discs from his bow.  They flew everywhere, lighting up the sky like a big firework show.  Rama shot his own arrows, and BAM! He destroyed Ravanaâ€™s fiery discs.

Then Ravana got really mad. He shot ten arrows at Rama!  But Rama was strong and didn't even flinch! He shot lots of arrows back at Ravana, hitting him all over.

Lakshmana, Rama's brother, helped too! He shot seven arrows and cut Ravana's flag to pieces. He even shot the driver of Ravana's chariot and broke his bow!  Then he helped Bibishana, Rama's friend, by shooting down a flaming spear that Ravana threw at him.

Ravana was furious! He got another super strong spear. It shone so brightly it looked like lightning! Lakshmana protected Bibishana, shooting many arrows at Ravana.

Ravana then threw his super spear at Lakshmana.  It hit Lakshmana, and he fell to the ground, hurt badly.

Rama was very sad to see his brother hurt. But he knew he had to keep fighting!  He pulled the spear out of Lakshmana.  Then, Rama and Ravana shot even more arrows at each other.  It was a huge battle!

Rama was so strong, he made Ravana run away! Rama promised to defeat Ravana and save his brother. He said, "Today, either Ravana or I will die!  I will avenge everything that happened!"

Rama kept shooting arrows at Ravana.  It was a noisy, scary battle with lots of arrows flying everywhere!  Ravana was afraid of Rama's power and he ran away.
