Rama and Lakshmana, two brave princes, went looking for Sita.  They walked through a scary, dark forest.  It was hard to walk through, with lots of bushes and trees.  But they were strong and kept going!

They walked for a long time and found a pretty forest with lots of flowers and animals.  They missed Sita very much and kept walking.

Soon, they found a cave.  Inside lived a HUGE, scary woman!  She had sharp teeth and a loud voice. She tried to grab Lakshmana!  Lakshmana was brave; he fought back and scared her away!

Lakshmana felt worried. He said he felt something bad was going to happen.  Then, WHOOSH!  A terrible noise shook the trees!

A giant appeared!  He was HUGE and headless!  His mouth was in his belly! He looked very scary.  He was so big he could grab animals from far away!  He grabbed Rama and Lakshmana!

Lakshmana was scared. He thought Rama should leave him and go find Sita. But Rama said, "Don't worry! We'll face this together!"

The giant, whose name was Kabandha, asked who they were.  Rama was worried.  He said, "We're in so much trouble!"  But he was still brave.
