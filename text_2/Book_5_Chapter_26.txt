Sita, Rama's wife, was very, very sad.  She was captured by the mean King Ravana, a ten-headed demon!  Tears streamed down her face as she cried out loud.  She rolled on the ground, feeling lost and hopeless.

"Ravana tricked Rama," she sobbed. "He took me away from my husband. I'm surrounded by scary demons.  I miss Rama so much!  What good are jewels and riches when I'm so far from my love? My heart feels like stone, it doesn't even break! I wish I could die!"

Sita knew Rama was brave and kind.  He had even defeated thousands of demons before!  She wondered why he wasn't coming to save her.  Maybe he didn't know where she was.  A giant bird, Jatayu, tried to help her, but Ravana killed him.

"If Rama knew," Sita cried, "he'd fly here faster than an arrow! He'd burn down Ravana's city, Lanka! He'd defeat all the demons!  Lanka would be filled with smoke and sadness.  Ravana will pay for this!"

Sita worried.  Maybe Rama was hurt, or even dead. Maybe he'd given up looking for her.  The thought made her even sadder.

"Oh, Rama," she whispered. "I want to die rather than live without you. I want to see you again, my brave and loving husband."  She missed him so much, more than anything in the world.  She closed her eyes, wishing for death to come and take away her pain.
