Ravana, the ten-headed king, heard his sister's angry words.  His hair stood on end! He sent his helpers away and thought hard.  He decided what to do.

Quickly, he went to his chariot. It was shiny and golden, pulled by strong mules!  The chariot zoomed like thunder.

Ravana rode along the seashore.  The place was beautiful! There were sparkling rivers, lots of trees with yummy fruits, and happy people.  Sages and magical creatures lived there.  Beautiful birds flew around.  The whole place was full of wonder.

Ravana saw huge forests, sparkling seashells, and even mountains of gold! He saw a giant fig tree. A huge bird, Garuda, had once tried to eat an elephant and a turtle there!  The tree branch broke!  Garuda moved it far away.

Ravana saw the tree and a nearby hermitage. He found Marica, a powerful demon who lived there.  Marica welcomed him.

"Is everything okay in Lanka, King Ravana?" asked Marica. "Why are you here so soon?"

Ravana began to tell Marica his plan...
