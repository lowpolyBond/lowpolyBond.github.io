Hanuman, the strong monkey, finished his story.  He said, "Rama and Sugriva, the monkey king, have done great things! I saw Sita. She is so strong and good! She's so powerful, she could even shake the whole earth!  Ravana is powerful too, because of his magic. That's why he's still alive. But Sita's anger is even scarier than fire!"

"Now, all you brave monkeys, with Jambavan leading, must help rescue Sita! You know why we need to go. We need to bring Sita back to Rama and Lakshmana!"

"I went to Lanka all by myself! I fought the giants! I even hurt Ravana and his friends!  With all of you brave monkeys, we can do so much more!  We will defeat Ravana and his whole army!"

"I will smash Ravana’s magic weapons! I'll throw mountains at them! Even the gods couldn't stop me!  Jambavan is so brave, nothing scares him. Nila is so strong, he could move a mountain! Dvivida is unbeatable!  And the Ashvins' sons are the strongest monkeys! I even set Lanka on fire!"

"Everywhere I went, I shouted, 'Rama and Lakshmana will win!  Sugriva is a great king! I am Hanuman, servant of Rama!' "

"Sita is waiting in Ravana's garden. She's very sad. She’s thin and weak, like the moon hidden behind clouds.  She’s all alone, surrounded by mean giant women who are unkind to her. But Sita is still loyal to Rama. She only thinks about him."

"I told Sita about Rama and Sugriva’s plan.  She was so happy! She's very lucky she hasn't destroyed Ravana already, because of his magic. But Rama will defeat him soon.  Sita is getting weaker every day without Rama."

"So, what should we do now?"
