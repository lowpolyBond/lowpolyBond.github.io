Once upon a time, Rama and his brothers met some wise holy men.  The holy men told Rama about a scary monster named Lavana.

Lavana was a very bad monster. He ate anything he could find!  He even ate other holy men! He lived in a forest called Madhu-vana and was super strong.

Rama asked, "Who is brave enough to kill this monster?"

Rama asked his brother Bharata, "Bharata, are you brave enough?"

Bharata said, "Yes! I will kill him!"

But then, Shatrughna, Rama's other brother, spoke up.  "Bharata is very brave," he said, "but he already went through so much hardship when Rama was gone. Let me go instead."  Shatrughna remembered how Bharata had lived simply, missing Rama, just eating fruits and roots.

Rama agreed. He said, "Shatrughna, you are brave and wise. Go and kill Lavana.  After you win, you can be the king of Madhu-vana!"

Rama told Shatrughna to rule the kingdom fairly and wisely. He told him to always listen to his older brothers.  He promised Shatrughna a proper ceremony to make him king.  Shatrughna promised to obey. And so, Shatrughna bravely went to fight the monster Lavana!
