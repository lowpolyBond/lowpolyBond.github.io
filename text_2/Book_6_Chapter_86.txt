Ravana's younger brother, Vibhishana, had a clever plan. He told Lakshmana, "See that army of Ravana's soldiers?  It's like a big, dark cloud! Attack them with rocks and trees!  If you break their lines, Indrajit, Ravana's powerful son, will appear.  Use your strong arrows to fight him quickly, before he finishes his magic ceremony!"

Lakshmana listened. He and his monkey and bear friends attacked!  The monkeys threw huge trees, and the titans threw spears and swords. It was a big, noisy battle!  The sky was full of flying weapons.  The monkeys and bears were strong and brave, and they fought hard.

Then, Indrajit, Ravana’s son, arrived in his chariot. He looked scary, like a dark storm!  He was ready to fight!

Hanuman, a very strong monkey, pulled up a giant tree and used it like a club!  He knocked down many titans.  Then, lots of titans attacked Hanuman with spears, swords, and axes.  Hanuman was hurt, but he kept fighting bravely.

Indrajit saw Hanuman causing a lot of trouble and said to his driver, “Go after that monkey! He'll defeat all my soldiers!”  Indrajit attacked Hanuman with his arrows and weapons.

Hanuman was furious! He shouted, "Indrajit, if you're brave, fight me fairly!"

Vibhishana saw Indrajit about to defeat Hanuman.  He warned Lakshmana, “Lakshmana!  Indrajit is about to kill Hanuman! Use your best arrows to stop him!”  Lakshmana saw Indrajit, strong and scary in his chariot, and got ready to fight.
