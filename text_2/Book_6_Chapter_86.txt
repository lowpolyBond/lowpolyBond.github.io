In dire straits, Vibhishaṇ spoke,
To Lakshmana, his words awoke.
"Let the demon army, dark as night,
Face the monkeys in a fearsome fight.

O Lakshmana, give it your all,
Break their ranks, let their forces fall.
When the demon army is no more,
Indrajit's magic will lose its core."

"Rush forth now, with arrows like thunderbolts,
On the enemies, fierce in assaults.
Until Indrajit completes his dark scheme,
Fight with all your might, as it may seem.

End the evil one's unjust reign,
His cruel acts, his dark domain.
Bring fear to him, let Lanka see,
The might of truth and victory."

Lakshmana, with auspicious signs,
Sent forth his arrows in straight lines.
Monkeys and bears, like trees they fight,
Against demons in battle's might.

Demons, too, with a deadly aim,
Attacked the monkeys in their claim.
With arrows sharp, and swords so keen,
A fierce battle, a fearsome scene.

In the tumultuous clash of might,
Lanka's echoes rang through the night.
The sky with weapons was shrouded dense,
As fear and courage waged their defense.

Demons of fearsome strength and face,
Threw their weapons in a frenzied race.
Monkeys, too, in their fierce attack,
Used trees and peaks to beat them back.

Among the demons, fear did swell,
Facing bears and monkeys, fighting well.
Indrajit, their leader, stood aside,
As his army scattered, he could not hide.

Enraged and bloodshot, his eyes ablaze,
Indrajit emerged from the shadowy haze.
In his chariot, armed for the fight,
He looked like death, a fearsome sight.

Seeing Hanuman, his foe so bold,
Indrajit's heart grew bitter and cold.
"Approach that monkey, take me near,
Or he'll destroy our forces here."

His charioteer obeyed with speed,
To Hanuman, they rode, indeed.
Indrajit unleashed his deadly storm,
Swords, spears, and axes took their form.

But Hanuman, with fury and might,
Received the weapons without a fright.
"Face me like a warrior, if you dare,
In this battle, let's make it fair.

Come closer, fight with all your might,
Feel my force, in this dreadful fight.
But, if you shy from an even game,
You'll leave this battle in defeat and shame."

Vibhishaṇ then spoke, wise and bold,
As Indrajit's chariot, the scene did unfold.
"O Lakshmana, with your arrows so bright,
End Indrajit's dark, conjuring plight.

His chariot, like a mountain, stands tall,
But your arrows will make it fall.
Strike him down, make him pay,
For his dark acts, in the light of day."

Hearing Vibhishaṇ's counsel and plea,
Lakshmana turned to face the enemy.
Indrajit, a mountain in his chariot, sat,
A fearsome sight, with a deadly spat.

Arrows like thunderbolts, Lakshmana sent,
Towards Indrajit, his aim intent.
The battle raged on, fierce and grand,
As the hero stood, bow in hand.
