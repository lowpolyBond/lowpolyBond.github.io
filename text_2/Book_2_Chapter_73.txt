King Dasaratha, Bharata's father, died.  Bharata's older brother, Rama, was sent away to live in the forest. Bharata was very sad.  He was angry with his stepmother, Queen Kaikeyi.

"What good is being king?" Bharata cried. "My father is dead, and Rama, who was like a father to me, is gone! You sent Rama away! You hurt everyone!"

He told Kaikeyi she was like a fire, burning everything good.  "You made my father very unhappy," Bharata said. "You killed him with your selfishness! You sent Rama, the best man ever, to live a hard life in the forest!"

Bharata felt terrible for his mother, Kaushalya, and Sumitra.  Rama was always kind and good to Kaikeyi, but she sent him away.  

"Why did you do this, Mother?" Bharata asked. "Rama is so kind, he would never hurt anyone.  How can I rule without Rama? It's like a baby trying to carry a huge weight!"

Bharata explained that in their family, the oldest son always became king. Rama was the oldest.  Kaikeyi didn't understand the rules. "You've ruined our family's good name!" he said. "I'll never let you get your way!"

Bharata roared like a lion.  He promised to bring Rama back from the forest and make him king. He would serve Rama with all his heart.
