Once upon a time, the mighty god Indra did something naughty. He tried to stop a wise man, Gautama, from doing his special prayers.  Gautama was very angry! He cursed Indra, making him lose his strength.  Indra was very sad and asked the other gods for help.

The gods went to some special beings called Pitris. They had a ram, a strong male sheep. The gods asked if they could use the ram's special parts to help Indra. The Pitris agreed, but said, "From now on, if people want to make offerings to us, they should offer a ram without those parts." And that's how it became a tradition.

This showed how powerful Gautama's prayers were!  Now, Indra needed to help a woman named Ahalya. Gautama’s curse had hidden her. Only the hero Rama could see her again!

Rama and his brother Lakshmana went to find Ahalya.  She was hidden, like the moon behind clouds.  But Rama could see her!  Ahalya was so happy to see Rama. She bowed down to show her respect.

The gods were happy too! Flowers rained from the sky, music played, and everyone celebrated.  When Gautama, the wise man, found out, he was also very happy. Ahalya and Gautama were together again!

Rama accepted their thanks and went on his journey to a new place called Mithila.  And that’s how a very important problem was solved, thanks to the power of kindness, and the wisdom of the gods.
