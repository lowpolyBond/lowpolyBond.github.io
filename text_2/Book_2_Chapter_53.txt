Rama, the kind prince, sat under a tree.  He said to his brother Lakshmana, "Tonight, we sleep in the forest without our friend Sumantra.  Let's take turns sleeping. We must protect Sita." They made a bed of leaves and grass.  Rama, used to a comfy bed, slept on the hard ground.

Rama worried about his father, the King.  He said, "Kaikeyi, the Queen, got what she wanted.  She might hurt the King!  He's old and weak. I'm worried she'll take the kingdom."  Rama was sad because he left his father.  He felt Kaikeyi was mean. She sent him away to the forest and made Bharata, his brother, king.

Rama was also worried about his mothers, Kaushalya and Sumitra. He feared Kaikeyi might be mean to them. "Lakshmana," he said, "please go back to Ayodhya and protect them. I will go to the Dandaka forest with Sita."

Rama was very sad. He cried and cried. He felt bad that he made his mother so unhappy.  He wished he hadn't been born.  He said, "I should help my mother, but I can't. I can't use my power to fight for the kingdom. That would be wrong."  He cried all night.

When Rama stopped crying, Lakshmana said, "Rama, Ayodhya is sad without you, but you shouldn't be so sad. We need to be strong for Sita. We can't live without you!"  Lakshmana didn't even want to see his family, he just wanted to be with Rama.

Rama sat next to Sita.  He knew he had to go into exile. He and Lakshmana lived in the forest, brave and strong like lions on a mountain.
