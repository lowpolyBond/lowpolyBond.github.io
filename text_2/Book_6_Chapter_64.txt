Kumbhakarna, a giant and strong warrior, wanted to fight Rama alone.  His brother, Mahodara, said, "Kumbhakarna, you're brave, but you're not thinking clearly!  King Ravana knows what to do. You're just being impulsive."

Mahodara explained, "It's silly to think you can beat Rama alone!  Rama is super strong. He defeated many powerful giants before.  Even our whole army might not win against him.  Fighting Rama alone is like waking a sleeping tiger!"

Mahodara had a clever plan. He told Ravana, "Let's pretend to fight Rama.  Five of us – me, Kumbhakarna, and others – will fight Rama. If we win, great! If we lose, we'll pretend we did! We'll come back covered in fake wounds, and say we killed Rama and Lakshmana."

"Then," Mahodara continued, "you, Ravana, will celebrate a big victory!  Everyone will believe Rama is dead.  Then, secretly, you can go to Sita. Tell her you're sorry, give her nice things, and she, heartbroken and alone, will agree to be with you."

Mahodara finished, "This way, you get Sita without a big, dangerous battle.  It’s much safer and smarter, my king!"
