Shatrughna had just won a big battle! He defeated a mean giant named Lavana.  The gods were so happy! They floated down from the sky and said, "Shatrughna, you're amazing!  What do you want as a reward?"

Shatrughna bowed his head.  He said, "I wish for this beautiful city!  It's so pretty!"

The gods smiled.  "You got it!" they said. "It's yours now! We'll call it Shurashena."  Then, the gods went back to their home in the sky.

Shatrughna called his army.  They were very happy he had won.  They all moved into the city.  It was a great place, right by the Yamuna River!  For twelve whole years, everyone was happy and safe.  The fields were full of yummy food!  The rain came at just the right time.

Shatrughna made the city even more beautiful. He added lots of parks and fun places. People from all over came to visit! The city sparkled like the moon.  There were shops and markets, homes for everyone. 

After twelve happy years, Shatrughna missed his brother Rama. He thought, "I need to see Rama again!"  So, he decided to leave his beautiful city and go visit his brother.
