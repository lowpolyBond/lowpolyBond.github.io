Prince Bharata, a brave and handsome prince, went on a long journey. He crossed many rivers: the Suddama, the Hladini, the Satali, and the Shalyakartana. He climbed mountains and walked through forests.  He even crossed a river where everything that fell in turned to stone!  His army followed him.

He crossed more rivers: the Shilavaha, the Ganges, and the Saraswati.  His tired horses drank from the Kulinga and Yamuna rivers.  They rested, and everyone had a drink of water to save for later.  Then, Bharata rode his big elephant, Bhadra, through a quiet forest.  They couldn't cross the Ganga at one place, so they went to another and crossed the Kutikoshtaka river.  Finally, they reached the village of Dharmavardhana.

After resting at Varutha, Bharata continued his journey east. He passed through forests with special trees and crossed many more rivers, using mountain ponies to help.  He even crossed the Uttamika, Kutika and Sukatavati rivers. His journey was very long!

After seven long days, he saw Ayodhya from far away.  He said to his charioteer, "Look! That's Ayodhya, but it doesn't look the same. It looks sad and dusty.  I don't hear happy people or music.  The streets are empty! The gardens are sad, and the birds aren't singing."  He felt worried.  Something was wrong.

He drove into Ayodhya through the north gate. His tired horses needed rest.  Guards wanted to help him, but Bharata was too sad.  He noticed the houses were open and empty. Nobody seemed happy. The temples were quiet, and the shops were closed. People looked sad and wore dirty clothes.

Bharata drove towards the palace.  His beautiful city was now sad and dusty.  His heart was heavy with worry. He bowed his head and entered his father's palace, very worried about what he saw.
