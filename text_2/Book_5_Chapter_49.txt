Hanuman, the brave monkey, looked up at Ravana, the ten-headed king of the demons.  Ravana was HUGE! He was all shiny gold, with bright red eyes that showed he was angry. He wore a fancy crown with sparkly jewels and a beautiful robe.  His teeth were sharp, and his lips were full. He looked powerful and scary!

Ravana sat on a super sparkly throne. It was made of crystal and covered with gems!  He had lots of necklaces and bracelets. His skin was painted with red paste, and he looked like a big, shiny mountain covered in snakes!  Beautiful women fanned him with special fans. Four important advisors stood around him, like the ocean surrounds the earth.

Hanuman was amazed! Ravana was so bright and strong, he looked like a shining mountain top with dark clouds around it.  Even though Ravana was mean, Hanuman was blown away by how amazing he looked.

Hanuman thought, "Wow! Ravana is so powerful and glorious! He could even rule the gods! But he's very bad. Heâ€™s cruel and hurts everyone.  He's so angry, he could even turn the whole earth into an ocean!"

Hanuman was filled with wonder, seeing how powerful, but also how wicked, the great demon king truly was.
