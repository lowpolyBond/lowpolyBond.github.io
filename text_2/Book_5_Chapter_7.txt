Hanuman, the strong monkey, explored Ravana's amazing city.  He saw huge buildings with golden windows and sparkling emeralds. They looked like clouds lit up by lightning!  The buildings were filled with treasures: shells, bows, and arrows.  They were so beautiful, even the gods and giants admired them. Ravana, the king, had built them himself with his magic powers.

Hanuman saw Ravana's palace. It was even more amazing! It was so beautiful, it looked like heaven on Earth.  Flowers bloomed everywhere, and pretty women served the king.  The palace shone like a cloud with lightning flashing through it.  It looked like a magical chariot flying through the sky pulled by beautiful swans.

The palace had sparkling gems everywhere! There were fake rocks and trees with tons of flowers. There were white houses with pools of lotus flowers.  There were pretty fountains too!

Hanuman saw the Pushpaka chariot! This flying chariot was like a giant pearl. It had birds made of emeralds, silver, and coral.  It had metal snakes and life-sized horses and birds!  Even little elephants sprayed water on the goddess Lakshmi, who sat in a pool holding lotuses.  The whole place smelled sweet and wonderful, like a blooming garden.

But Hanuman couldn't find Sita, the princess! He looked everywhere in Ravana's amazing city, but he couldn't find her. He was so sad and worried. He couldn't find the princess he was supposed to rescue.  His heart was filled with worry.
