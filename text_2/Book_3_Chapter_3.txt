Deep in the forest, a scary giant named Viradha shouted, "Who are you? What are you doing here?"

Rama, a brave prince, answered, "We are warriors traveling through the woods."  Then Rama asked, "Who are *you*?"

Viradha boasted, "I'm Viradha!  I'm so strong, no weapon can hurt me!  Leave now, or I'll hurt you!"

Rama was angry. "You'll fight us, and you'll lose!" He aimed his bow and shot many sharp arrows at Viradha.

The arrows hurt Viradha! He dropped Sita, the princess Rama was protecting.  He roared and attacked Rama and his brother Lakshmana with a big spear.

Rama and Lakshmana shot more arrows, but Viradha laughed.  His magic kept him safe from the arrows! He was very strong. He swung his spear like a giant lightning bolt.

Rama cleverly shot two arrows and broke Viradha's spear!  Then Rama and Lakshmana fought Viradha with their swords.  Viradha was strong, but Rama and Lakshmana were brave.

Viradha, still very strong, grabbed Rama and Lakshmana and put them on his shoulders. He carried them through the dark forest.  He was big and loud like a storm cloud!
