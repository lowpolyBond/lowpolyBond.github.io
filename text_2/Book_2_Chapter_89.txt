Bharata woke up where Rama had slept.  He woke his brother, Shatrughna. "Brother," he said, "let's get going!  It's morning.  Let's ask Guha to help us cross the river."

Shatrughna said, "I was already awake! I couldn't sleep, I was thinking of Rama!"

Just then, Guha arrived.  He asked Bharata politely, "Did you sleep well? Was everything okay?"

Bharata said, "Thank you, Guha! We slept peacefully. Please help our army cross the river."

Guha quickly went to his people. "Everyone, wake up!" he called. "Get the boats! We need to help the army cross."

His people got five hundred boats ready!  They even had a special, fancy boat called the "Svastika." It had bells and flags and soft rugs inside. Guha himself drove this boat.  Bharata, Shatrughna, the queens, and many others rode in it.

It was a busy time!  People were packing up camp, some were bathing in the river. The boats were full of people, horses, elephants, and everything else!  Even some elephants swam across!

The boats zoomed across the river.  After they reached the other side, Guha's people played games in the water while the others got off the boats.  The army moved into a lovely forest.

They arrived at a special place called Prayaga. Bharata told his army to rest.  Then, with his teacher Vasishtha, he went to visit a wise old man named Bharadvaja.  They saw his beautiful huts in the forest, made of leaves.
