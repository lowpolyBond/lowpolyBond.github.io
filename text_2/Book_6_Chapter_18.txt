Rama and his friends were talking about Bibishana, Ravana's brother, who had come to them for help.  Sugriva, the monkey king, wasn't sure he could trust Bibishana. He worried that Bibishana might be a trick.

Rama was kind. He said, "Even if I'm wrong, I'll always help someone who asks for help.  A good person wouldn't blame me for that."

Sugriva still worried. He said, "If Bibishana betrayed his own brother, who knows who else he'll betray?"

Rama smiled. "Sugriva," he said, "kings often have enemies among their family and neighbors.  Bibishana is probably here because he's afraid of Ravana.  Maybe his family isn't all bad.  We aren't related to Ravana, and he doesn't want our land.  We should help him."

Rama explained that even a bad person deserves help if they ask for it. He told a story about a kind pigeon who helped even its enemy. Then he quoted a wise saying: "We should always help people who need protection, even if they are our enemies. It's the right thing to do."

Rama said, "I'll protect Bibishana, no matter what!"  Sugriva agreed. He said, "You're so good and kind, Rama. I trust you. Let's welcome Bibishana!"

And so, Rama welcomed Bibishana to their group, just like he would welcome a friend.
