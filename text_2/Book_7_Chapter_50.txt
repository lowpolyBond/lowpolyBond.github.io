Lakshmana was very sad.  He saw Sita, Rama's wife, going away. He talked to Sumantra, the chariot driver.

"Look what's happened to Rama!" Lakshmana cried. "He had to send Sita away.  It's so unfair!  It seems like fate is being mean to Rama."

Lakshmana remembered how brave Rama was. He even fought gods and monsters! But even the strongest person can't fight fate.  He thought it was much worse than when Rama lived alone in the forest for fourteen years.

Sumantra, the wise chariot driver, said, "Don't worry, Lakshmana.  The wise men predicted this a long time ago.  It's Rama's destiny to be unhappy.  He'll be separated from everyone he loves, even you, Bharata, and Shatrughna."

Sumantra explained that King Dasaratha, Rama's father, had heard this sad prediction a long time ago. He told Sumantra to keep it a secret.  But Sumantra felt he should tell Lakshmana now.

"It was all because of fate," Sumantra said. "This sad thing happening now is also because of fate.  Please, don't tell Bharata or Shatrughna."

Lakshmana, still worried, asked, "Tell me everything!"
