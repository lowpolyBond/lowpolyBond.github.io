Rama, a strong and brave prince, went into a big forest called Dandaka.  He saw a village of special homes made of leaves and grass.  The homes shone brightly, like the sun.

Many animals lived there happily. Deer played, birds sang, and pretty magical fairies danced!  The homes were neat and tidy.  Sacred fires burned inside, and there were lots of fruits, roots, and water.  Big trees with yummy fruit grew all around.

Wise old men lived there. They were very holy and spent their time praying and studying.  They were peaceful and kind, like the sun.  Their village was beautiful, with flowers and ponds full of lilies.

Rama, with his brother Lakshmana and his wife Sita, entered the village.  He put down his bow. The wise men were so happy to see them! They welcomed Rama and his family.

The wise men were amazed by Rama. He was so handsome and strong! They took Rama to a leaf hut. They offered him water to wash, and gave him delicious fruits and roots.

The wise men told Rama, "You are our king!  Even though we live in the forest, you are our protector.  Please keep us safe, just like a mother protects her baby."

They gave Rama gifts of fruits, flowers, and roots. They were so grateful that such a good king would visit their peaceful home.  Rama was happy to help them.
