Once upon a time, Sita, Rama's wife, saw something terrible. It was Rama's head and his beautiful bow.  She remembered what Hanuman had said about Rama's friend Sugriva.  The head looked just like Rama's! Sita knew, in her heart, that something awful had happened.  She was very, very sad.

She was angry at Kaikeyi, the queen who had sent Rama away.  Sita cried out, "Kaikeyi, you made Rama go away!  He was so good, and now he's dead because of you! What did Rama ever do to you to deserve being sent to the forest?"

Sita trembled and fainted.  When she woke up, she went to Rama's head and cried even more.  She said, "My brave Rama, my wonderful husband, you're gone!  It's the worst thing that could happen to a woman, losing her husband.  My mother-in-law, Kaushalya, will be so heartbroken.  People said you'd live a long time, but they were wrong.  How could death take you so suddenly?  Oh, Rama, my love, you were so strong and clever, why did you have to die?  Ravana, please, let me die with my Rama!"

Sita cried and cried. She missed Rama's golden bow, which she used to decorate with pretty flowers. She wished she could join him in the sky with his father and ancestors.  She was heartbroken that wild animals were hurting his body.  She knew that Kaushalya would die of sadness when she found out what happened.  Sita blamed herself for Rama's death. She begged Ravana to let her die beside her husband.

While Sita cried, a giant guard saw something happening. He rushed to tell Ravana, the king of the giants.  He said, "Great King!  Prahasta and the other ministers are here to see you!"

Ravana left Sita to talk to his helpers.  When he was gone, Rama's head and bow disappeared!  Ravana and his helpers decided to fight Rama's friends.  Ravana shouted, "Beat the drums!  Gather the army!"  His army came, ready for war.
