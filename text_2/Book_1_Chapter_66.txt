One morning, King Janaka woke up.  He prayed, then called Prince Rama, Prince Lakshmana, and a wise man named Vishvamitra.  He bowed to them and asked, "How can I help you?"

Vishvamitra said, "These princes are sons of King Dasaratha. They want to see your special bow."

King Janaka said, "This bow has a long history!  A long, long time ago, a powerful god, Lord Shiva, used it.  He was angry, but the gods calmed him down. Then, they gave the bow to King Devarata."

King Janaka continued, "One day, while I was plowing a field, a beautiful girl appeared! I named her Sita, and she became my daughter.  I promised to give Sita to a prince who could string this powerful bow. Many princes tried, but none could! They got angry, attacked my kingdom, and made everyone very unhappy.  Finally, I defeated them."

He smiled. "This is the bow.  If Prince Rama can string it, Sita will be his wife!"
