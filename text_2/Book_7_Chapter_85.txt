Lakshmana told Rama a story.  "Tell me more about Vritra's death," Rama said.

Lakshmana continued, "The gods, led by Indra (who had a thousand eyes!), asked Vishnu for help.  Vritra was very strong!  But Vishnu said, 'I can't kill Vritra, but I'll help you.'  He shared his power.  Some went into Indra, some went into Indra's thunderbolt, and some went into the earth."

"Then, the gods attacked Vritra.  He was so bright, it looked like he could burn the whole world! The gods were scared!  But Indra threw his thunderbolt.  It hit Vritra hard, like a giant fire!"

"Indra felt bad because he killed Vritra.  It was a bad thing to do!  He ran away, feeling very sad."

The gods went to Vishnu. "You helped us win! But Indra is sad because of what he did. Can you help him?" they asked.

Vishnu said, "Indra needs to perform a special ceremony, a sacrifice, to make things right. Then he'll be okay again."  Then Vishnu went back home.
