Rama, a strong and kind prince, was sent away to live in the forest.  His brother Bharata was very sad.  Bharata wondered how to see Rama again.

His brother Shatrughna was angry!  "How could this happen?" he asked. "Rama is so good, and Lakshmana is so brave! Why didn't Lakshmana stop Father?"  Shatrughna thought their father was tricked.

Suddenly, a hunchbacked woman named Manthara came in. She was dressed like a queen because Kaikeyi, their stepmother, had given her fancy clothes and jewels. She looked like a little monkey!

The guards grabbed Manthara.  "She made Rama go away!" they shouted.  Shatrughna was furious! He wanted to punish her for making his family so sad.

Shatrughna was so angry, he grabbed Manthara and dragged her around the palace!  Her jewels flew everywhere, like stars in the night sky.  The other women in the palace ran away, scared.

They all went to Queen Kaushalya, Rama's mother, to hide.  Shatrughna was about to punish Manthara even more when Bharata stopped him.

"Brother," Bharata said, "we don't hurt women.  If Rama knew we hurt Manthara, he'd be even sadder."  Bharata knew Rama wouldn't like them hurting anyone.

Shatrughna calmed down. He let Manthara go.  Manthara was very scared and ran to Kaikeyi for comfort.  Kaikeyi felt very sorry for what had happened.
