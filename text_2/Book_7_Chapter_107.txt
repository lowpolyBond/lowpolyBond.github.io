Rama was very sad.  He had to leave his home, Ayodhya. He told everyone, "Today, my brother Bharata will be king. Then, I'm going to the forest."  Everyone was heartbroken.

Bharata heard this and cried. He didn't want to be king without Rama! He said, "I won't be king without you, Rama!  Please let your sons, Kusha and Lava, rule instead."

The wise man, Vasishtha, saw how sad everyone was. He told Rama, "Rama, your people love you!  They want to come with you."

The people cried out, "Rama, please take us with you! We'll go anywhere you go!"

Rama loved his people. He said, "Okay!"

First, Rama made Kusha and Lava, his sons, kings of different parts of the kingdom. He gave them lots of chariots, elephants, horses, and treasures.

Then, Rama sent a message to his brother Shatrughna.  He was ready for his big journey to the forest, with his loving people following him.
