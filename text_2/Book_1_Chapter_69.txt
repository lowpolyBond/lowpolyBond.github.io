King Dasaratha woke up happy!  He told his helpers to get ready for a big trip.  He needed lots of gold and jewels.  His army had to get ready too, with chariots and special chairs to carry people.  Important wise men, like Vasishtha and many others, would come along.  King Janaka's messengers were waiting, so they had to hurry!

The king and his wise men set off.  They traveled for four nights.  When they arrived at King Janaka's city, it was all decorated! King Janaka was so happy to see them. He welcomed King Dasaratha and said, "It's an honor to have you here! You'll get to see your sons soon!"  He was also happy to see all the wise men. He said the wedding could happen now, and it would make both their kingdoms even better.

King Dasaratha was polite. He said, "We are happy to do what you think is best." King Janaka was amazed by how kind and respectful King Dasaratha was.

That night, all the wise men talked and laughed together. King Dasaratha was so happy to be with his sons. He enjoyed being a guest of King Janaka.  King Janaka made sure everything was ready for the wedding and then went to bed.
