Bharata heard wonderful news! His brother Rama was coming home!  Bharata was so happy! He told his brother Shatrughna, "Let's have a big party! Everyone needs to clean up and get ready.  Let's decorate the city with flowers and music to welcome Rama!"

Shatrughna got lots of workers.  "Fix the roads!" he shouted. "Make them smooth and pretty!  Sprinkle water, and scatter flowers and grain everywhere!  Let's put up flags and banners!"  The whole city got busy making everything beautiful.

Soon, elephants, horses, and chariots filled the streets.  Bharata's mom and other queens came in palanquins. Bharata himself wore simple clothes, but he was beaming. He even put Rama's sandals on his head – that’s how much he loved his brother!  The city was noisy with trumpets, drums, and happy shouts!

Bharata looked around. "Where are Rama and the monkeys?" he asked Hanuman.

Hanuman laughed. "They're resting near the river! Look! See that big cloud of dust? And that shiny chariot in the sky? That's Rama's special flying chariot!"

Suddenly, everyone shouted, "Rama is here!"

People jumped off their horses and elephants. They saw Rama's shining chariot.  Bharata ran to greet him. He bowed down and offered Rama water to wash.  Rama was shining like the sun! His flying chariot landed gently.  Bharata hugged Rama tightly! He hugged Lakshmana and Sita too! He even hugged all the monkey friends who had helped Rama.

Bharata told Sugriva, "We're brothers! You’re like a fifth brother now!" He thanked Bibishana for helping too.  Shatrughna bowed to Sita. Rama bowed to his mother and all his family.  Everyone was overjoyed!

Bharata said to Rama, "This kingdom is yours! I've taken good care of it for you."

Bharata's words made the monkeys and Bibishana cry with happiness. Rama hugged Bharata. Then, Rama sent his magic chariot back to its owner.  Rama went to see his teacher and sat beside him.

Everyone was happy. Rama was finally home!
