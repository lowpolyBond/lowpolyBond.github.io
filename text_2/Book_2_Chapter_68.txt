King Dasharatha died!  His wise advisor, Vasishtha, needed Rama and his brother Bharata.  Bharata was living happily with his aunt and uncle.  So Vasishtha sent five fast messengers.

"Go quickly!" Vasishtha said. "Find Bharata!  Don't tell him about the King's death or Rama's troubles.  Just tell him something important happened back home. Take him nice gifts!"

The messengers – Siddartha, Vijaya, Jayanta, Asoka, and Nandana – agreed.  They rode their strong horses.  Their journey was long! They rode past sparkling rivers and big mountains. They saw amazing animals like elephants and tigers!  Their horses got tired, but the messengers kept going.  They wanted to help their kingdom.

They rode past beautiful lakes and sacred trees. They even saw a place where the god Vishnu had walked!

Finally, after a long, long time, they reached Bharata's city.  It was night.  But the messengers were ready to tell Bharata what Vasishtha wanted.  They had to save their kingdom!
