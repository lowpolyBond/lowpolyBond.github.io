Lakshmana said some very unkind things.  Poor Sita, Rama's wife, was so sad she fell to the ground.  When she got up, her eyes were full of tears.  She said, "I must have done something very wrong in my past life to deserve this. I was happy following Rama in the forest, even when things were hard. Now, all alone, how can I live? Who will help me?  What will I tell the holy people? Why did Rama, my good husband, leave me?"

Sita was worried about what people would think of Rama. She didn't want to die, because that would hurt her family.  She asked Lakshmana to tell Rama, "I am truly good and I love Rama with all my heart. He left me because people were mean to him. But he should have stayed with me, because I have nowhere else to go.  A husband is like a god to his wife. A wife should always try to please her husband, even if it means giving up her own life."

Sita told Lakshmana that she was expecting a baby.  She asked him to go tell Rama all these things.  Lakshmana felt very sad. He bowed to Sita and said he could never look at her face, since Rama had sent her away. He couldn't even look her in the eyes, he was that sad.

Lakshmana got on a boat and crossed the river.  He kept looking back at Sita. Sita was all alone, so sad and scared.  She watched Lakshmana's chariot go far away, until it disappeared.   She cried and cried, all alone in the forest. The peacocks cried too, as if they felt her sadness.
