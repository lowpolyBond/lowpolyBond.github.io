Ravana, a powerful king, looked at his army.  He spoke to Prahasta, his best general.  "Prahasta," he said, "get our soldiers ready to defend the city!"

Prahasta quickly got the soldiers ready inside and outside the city walls.  He went back to Ravana and said, "It's all set, Your Majesty! Now, do what you planned."

Ravana then talked to his army.  "Always tell me if something is wrong," he said. "Even if it's good or bad news, tell me!  You always follow me, and you will help me win!"

Ravana continued, "I wanted to attack a long time ago, but my brother Kumbhakarna was asleep! He just woke up after a six-month sleep! I brought Sita, Rama's beautiful wife, here from the forest. She's so lovely; she's like a golden statue!  But she doesn't want to be with me.  She wants to go back to Rama. She asked for a year, and I said yes. But I'm tired of waiting!"

Ravana worried, "How will Rama and his brother get across the big ocean with all the scary sea monsters?  Will they even try? What do you think?"

He boasted, "My army is very strong!  We won a big battle against the gods before, and we'll win this one too! Rama and his monkey friends are here, but I will defeat them!"

Kumbhakarna, Ravana's giant brother, got angry when he heard Ravana. "You shouldn't have brought Sita here without asking us!" he roared. "You should have planned better!  But don't worry, I'll help you!  I'll fight Rama and his army! I'm huge and strong! I'll scare everyone, even the gods! I'll kill Rama and his brother, and I'll eat the monkey leaders! Then Sita will be yours forever!"
