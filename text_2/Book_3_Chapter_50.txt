Jatayu, a giant vulture, was sleeping soundly.  Then he heard a noise!  He opened his eyes and saw Ravana, a ten-headed king, carrying away a beautiful princess named Sita.

Jatayu, the King of the Vultures, flew down from his tree.  He spoke to Ravana, "Stop!  This is wrong!  You are stealing Sita, who is married to Rama, a great and good king.  It is not right for a king to take another's wife!"

Jatayu explained that being a king meant being fair and honest.  "Kings protect everyone, not just themselves.  Stealing someone's wife is shameful!"

Ravana was a mean and selfish king.  Jatayu reminded him that even powerful kings should follow the rules.  "Rama is a good king. He hasn't done anything wrong. Why are you hurting him by taking his wife?"

Jatayu warned Ravana, "Rama is very strong! He will be very angry.  He will punish you!"  Jatayu was brave and old, even though Ravana was young and strong. "You can't take Sita while I'm here!" he squawked.

Jatayu challenged Ravana to a fight.  "Fight me, if you dare!  You are not stronger than Rama!" He told Ravana he was acting like a thief.

Ravana ignored Jatayu. He tried to fly away with Sita.  But Jatayu bravely attacked Ravana, trying to stop him. He fought hard to save Sita, even though he was very old. He was doing what was right.  He wanted to help Rama and Sita, even if it meant putting his own life in danger.
