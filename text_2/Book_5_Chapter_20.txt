Ravana, a powerful demon king, went to see Sita.  Sita was sad and alone. Ravana said very nice things to her, trying to trick her.

He said, "You are so beautiful! I love you!  Don't be scared of me.  No one here can stop me."  He boasted about how powerful he was and how he could take anyone's wife.  But he said *he* wouldn't force Sita.  He wanted her to choose him.

Ravana said, "Life with me will be amazing! You'll have beautiful clothes, jewels, delicious food, and lots of fun.  You'll be my queen, and everyone will serve you!"

He told Sita that Rama, her husband, was weak and poor. He said Rama was far away, living a hard life, and could never find her. He said Sita shouldn't worry about Rama anymore.

"Forget Rama," Ravana said. "I have so much wealth and power!  I'm much better than him!  Join me, and you'll have everything you could ever want." He described a life filled with luxury and pleasure, filled with beautiful gardens and sparkling jewels.

Ravana kept talking, trying to convince Sita to be his wife. He promised her riches and a life of comfort, hoping she would forget about Rama and choose him instead.
