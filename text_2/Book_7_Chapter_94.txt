One morning, two young boys woke up. They were learning to be holy men.  After their bath, they started to sing a special song, just like their teacher told them to.

King Rama and his brother listened. The song was beautiful! It had a lovely tune, and it was played with special instruments. Rama was very surprised.

Rama stopped the important ceremony. He called everyone â€“ wise men, kings, musicians, and even people who knew about stars! He wanted everyone to hear the song.

Then, he brought the two boys to the front.  They sang a beautiful song, even more beautiful than magical singing birds! Everyone loved it! They kept looking at the boys, saying, "They look just like Rama!  They're like his twins!"

The boys, Kusha and Lava, sang many parts of the story.  After a long time, Rama said, "Give these boys lots of gold!"

But Kusha and Lava refused the gold. "We don't need gold," they said. "We're happy with simple food."

Rama was amazed. He asked, "Who wrote this wonderful song?"

The boys said, "A very wise man named Valmiki wrote it.  It's the story of your whole life! It has many parts, and it's very long."

Rama, with all the important people, listened to more of the song that day. It was a very special story, and everyone loved hearing it.
