After a big battle, Sugriva, a monkey king, felt very sad.  He had just defeated his brother, Bali, and Bali was dead.  Bali's wife, Tara, was very upset and crying.

Sugriva went to Rama, a brave prince who had helped him win the battle.  Sugriva was covered in tears. He told Rama, "I'm so sorry! I killed my brother. I was angry, but now I feel terrible. I miss him so much. Tara and Bali's son, Angada, are heartbroken too. I don't even want to be king anymore!"

Rama, a kind and strong prince, listened carefully.  Sugriva explained that Bali had been kind and had even tried to spare him. Sugriva said, "I did a bad thing. I'm a bad brother."

Then Tara came to Rama.  She was very sad and heartbroken.  She told Rama, "You killed my husband.  Please kill me too! I want to be with him."

Rama was kind but sad. He told Tara, "Don't cry.  Everything happens for a reason.  You and Angada will be happy again.  This is part of how the world works."

Rama comforted Tara.  He told her that everything that happened was part of a bigger plan. He said that even though it was sad, it was all part of life. Tara felt a little better, knowing that Rama understood.
