Guha was sad because Rama had left. He talked to the driver, Sumantra, and saw Rama go. Then Guha went home.

Sumantra learned that Rama had reached a place called Prayaga, stayed with a wise man, and was going to Cittrakuta.  He said goodbye to Guha and drove his chariot back to Ayodhya.  He drove quickly, past pretty flowers and rivers.  He got back on the third day.

Ayodhya was quiet and sad. Sumantra wondered, "Is everyone so sad because Rama is gone?"

People rushed to his chariot and cried, "Where is Rama?" Sumantra said, "Rama crossed a big river and told me to come back."  Everyone cried, "Oh, Rama! We miss him so much! He was so kind and good!"

Sumantra heard women crying in their houses. He hurried to the palace.

At the palace, the women cried when they saw Sumantra alone.  They were very sad that Rama was gone.  Even the king's wives cried. They worried about Queen Kaushalya, Rama's mother.

Sumantra went to see King Dasaratha.  He told the king what Rama had said. The king was so sad, he fainted!

The queens woke him up. They said, "Don't be so sad! Rama is safe.  Don't worry about Queen Kaikeyi!"  But then, Queen Kaushalya fainted from sadness too!

Everyone in Ayodhya cried. It was as sad as the day Rama left.
