Indrajit, Ravana's strong son, was killed by Lakshmana, Rama's brother.  Some spies rushed to tell Ravana the bad news.  "Great King," they cried, "Lakshmana defeated Indrajit in battle!"

Ravana was heartbroken. He fainted!  When he woke, he was very sad. He cried, "My brave son!  He could defeat even the gods! Why did he lose to Lakshmana?"  He missed his son terribly.  He felt like the whole world was empty without him. He even worried about his daughters. He wondered why Rama and Lakshmana were still alive.

Ravana's sadness turned to anger.  He was so angry, smoke seemed to come out of his mouth! His eyes glowed red. He looked scary, like a very angry god!  He was furious.  He ground his teeth and roared!

"I have magic powers!" he shouted to his army. "I have special armor and a powerful bow! No one can beat me, not even Indra, the king of the gods! I will defeat Rama and Lakshmana!"

But his anger was still about Indrajit's death.  He decided to take revenge on Sita, Rama's wife. "Indrajit tricked the monkeys with a fake Sita," he growled. "I will make it real! I will kill Sita!"

Ravana grabbed his sword and ran towards Sita. His army cheered, saying, “Ravana is unstoppable! He’ll defeat Rama and Lakshmana!”

Sita was scared. She saw Ravana coming, sword in hand.  She cried, "Maybe Rama and Lakshmana are dead! Or maybe Ravana is going to kill me because of his son's death!"  She was very upset she hadn't left with Hanuman earlier.

A wise advisor, Suparshva, stopped Ravana.  "King," he said, "Don't kill Sita! You are a wise king. Killing a woman is wrong.  Wait until tomorrow.  Then, attack Rama and Lakshmana!"

Ravana listened. He calmed down a little. He went back to his palace, still very angry, but he didn't kill Sita that day.
