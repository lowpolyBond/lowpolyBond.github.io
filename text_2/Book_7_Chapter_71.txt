Shatrughna, a prince, decided to go home to Ayodhya after twelve years.  He didn't take many soldiers with him.  He rode in one hundred chariots pulled by strong horses.

He traveled a long way and stopped at a wise man's home,  Valmiki's hermitage. Valmiki welcomed Shatrughna.  He washed his feet and gave him a drink.

Valmiki told Shatrughna a great story. It was about Shatrughna defeating a very bad man named Lavana.  Valmiki said, "You were so brave!  Even kings couldn't defeat Lavana, but you did it easily! Everyone in the world is happy!" Valmiki smelled Shatrughna's head, a sign of great respect, and gave him a big feast.

After eating, Shatrughna listened to beautiful music. The music told the story of his brother Rama.  It was a wonderful story of Rama's bravery.  Shatrughna cried because the music was so moving.  His soldiers cried too!  They were amazed.

They whispered, "Was that a dream? Was it real?"  They wanted to ask Valmiki more questions, but Shatrughna said, "It's not polite to ask a wise man too many questions.  Amazing things happen here!"

Shatrughna thanked Valmiki and went to bed.
