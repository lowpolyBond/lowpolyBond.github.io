Once upon a time, King Yayati was very, very old.  He was grumpy because he wanted to be young again and have fun. He asked his son Yadu to take his old age. Yadu said no, and told his father to ask Puru instead. Puru happily agreed!  Yayati became young again, had lots of fun, and ruled for a long, long time.  After many years, he gave his old age back to Puru. But Yayati was mean to another son, and cursed him. Puru became king.

Rama, a kind and wise king, was known for his fair rule. One day, Lakshmana, Ramaâ€™s brother, went to the city gates.  Nobody needed help!  Rama's kingdom was peaceful and happy.  But then, Lakshmana saw a dog. The dog wanted to talk to Rama.

The dog told Rama a story. A holy man had hurt the dog.  The dog was wise and explained that the king should be kind and fair to everyone. Rama listened carefully.  He learned that the holy man was angry and had hurt the dog. The dog explained that anger is bad.

Rama's advisors said the holy man shouldn't be punished because he was a holy man.  But the dog had a clever idea. The dog used to be the head of a temple, but was reborn as a dog because of his past actions.  He asked Rama to make the angry holy man the head of the temple instead. The holy man was given a big job.  Everyone was surprised, but Rama knew what he was doing.

Later, a vulture and an owl argued over a nest. They asked Rama to decide. The vulture lied about building the nest, but the owl told the truth. Rama, with his wise advisors, decided in favour of the owl. He learned that the vulture was a king who was cursed to be a vulture long ago.  A good king named Rama had lifted the curse.  Rama then touched the vulture, and it became a human again!  Everyone learned that even kings need to be kind and fair, and that everyone deserves a second chance.
