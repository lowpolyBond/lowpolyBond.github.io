Lakshmana told Rama a story.  He told him about a powerful god named Indra. Indra fought and defeated a scary monster called Vritra. But Indra felt very bad because he had hurt a holy person.  He hid away, feeling sad and ashamed.

Because Indra was gone, the world was in trouble! There was no rain.  The rivers dried up.  The trees withered.  Everyone was sad.

The other gods were worried. They remembered what another powerful god, Vishnu, had said to do. They went to find Indra, who was hiding like a snake shedding its skin.

The gods helped Indra.  They did a special ceremony called the Ashvamedha. It was a big horse sacrifice to make Indra feel better.  After the ceremony, Indraâ€™s bad feelings left him.  It split into four parts.

One part went to live in the rushing rivers during the rainy season. Another part lived in salty earth. A third part lived with proud women for three nights each month. And the last part lived in people who lied and caused innocent people to die.

The gods were happy. Indra was happy. The rain came back! The world was happy again.  Lakshmana finished the story, "This shows how powerful the Ashvamedha ceremony is, Rama! You should do one too!"  Rama felt very happy and satisfied to hear this amazing story.
