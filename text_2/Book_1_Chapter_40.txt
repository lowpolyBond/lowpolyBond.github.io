Long ago, King Sagara's sons lost a magical horse.  They searched everywhere!  They dug and dug, looking for the horse and the person who stole it.

The gods knew the sons were in trouble. They asked Brahma, a powerful god, for help. Brahma said, "The wise Kapila is watching over the world. The princes will anger him."

The sons kept digging. They dug and dug, making a lot of noise!  They found huge elephants holding up the earth! They were amazing!  The elephants were so big, they shook the whole world when they moved!

The princes kept digging.  Finally, they found Kapila and the horse.  They thought Kapila stole the horse!  They were very angry.

They shouted, "Thief! You stole the horse!"

Kapila was very upset. He was a very powerful holy man. He got angry and *poof!*  All the princes turned to ash!  They were gone.  The earth was very big and held many secrets.  The princes were not very careful, and they paid the price.
