Hanuman peeked into a beautiful room. It was sparkly and amazing!  There were comfy couches made of shiny emerald green and gold. A big, white tent hung above a golden bed.  It looked like a king's bed!

On the bed, a HUGE giant lay sleeping. He was like a thundercloud, all purple and strong.  He had gold clothes and shiny earrings. He smelled of sweet flowers and perfume.  He breathed loudly, like a big snake. Hanuman was scared but he was brave, so he hid nearby and watched.

The giant's arms were huge, like giant tree trunks!  They were covered in bracelets.  Hanuman thought they looked like giant snakes.

The giant's mouth smelled of sweet mangoes and yummy food.  A shiny crown was on his head.

Then, Hanuman saw many beautiful women sleeping around the giant. They were the giant's wives! They were wearing pretty jewelry and shiny clothes. Some held musical instruments. They looked like princesses.

One woman was sleeping on a special bed all by herself.  She was very beautiful, wearing shiny clothes and lots of jewels. Hanuman thought, "Maybe this is Sita!" He was so happy, he jumped and danced and swung from the pillars! He was a monkey, after all!
