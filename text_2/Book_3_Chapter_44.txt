Rama, a strong and brave prince, was hunting.  He saw a beautiful deer.  It looked so cute and playful!  But the deer was tricky! It would run a little, then stop, then run again, always just out of reach.

Rama chased the deer deep into the forest.  Sometimes the deer was easy to see, then *poof* – gone! It was like a game of hide-and-seek.  The deer was really a magical creature named Marica, trying to trick Rama!

Rama got very angry. He shot a super-bright arrow, like a flash of lightning!  The arrow hit Marica, and Marica, who was really a giant, cried out in pain.  He changed back into his giant form and fell to the ground.

Before he died, Marica used magic to make his voice sound like Rama's. He shouted, "Sita! Lakshmana!"  This was a trick to get Sita and Lakshmana in trouble.

Rama knew it was a trick!  He remembered his brother Lakshmana’s warning about Marica. Rama felt scared and worried about his wife and brother.

Rama quickly found another deer. He took it back to his wife and brother, Sita and Lakshmana.  He was relieved to find them safe.  He knew Marica’s trick was very dangerous.
