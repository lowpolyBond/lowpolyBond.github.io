Once upon a time, after defeating his brother, the powerful demon king Ravana flew in his amazing flying chariot, the Pushpaka.  It looked like a giant, golden flower!  But then, the chariot stopped. Ravana was puzzled.

His clever advisor, Marica, said, "The chariot only works for the god of wealth, Kubera, and it's far from him now!"

Suddenly, a strong, little dwarf with a shaved head appeared.  It was Nandi, Shiva's servant! Nandi shouted, "Get away!  Lord Shiva is here, and nobody else is allowed!"

Ravana, angry, jumped out of the chariot.  He saw Nandi standing next to a powerful god, Shiva, who was shining brightly.  Ravana laughed at Nandi, who looked like a monkey.

Nandi was furious! "Because you laughed at my monkey form," he said, "strong monkey warriors will be born to defeat you and your people!" He warned Ravana but Ravana ignored him.

Ravana was so angry that the chariot was stopped, he grabbed the mountain where Shiva was and shook it!  Shiva’s wife, Parvati, got scared.

Shiva, just for fun, pressed the mountain down with his big toe.  Ouch!  Ravana's arms were crushed!  He yelled so loud that the whole world shook!  Everyone was terrified.

The gods begged Ravana to apologize to Shiva.  Ravana finally prayed to Shiva for a thousand years!

Shiva was happy. He healed Ravana’s arms and said, "From now on, your name will be Ravana, because your yell shook the world!"  He also gave Ravana a super-powerful sword.

Ravana went back to his flying chariot. He became even more powerful, conquering many kingdoms.  Everyone feared him.  They knew he was unbeatable.
