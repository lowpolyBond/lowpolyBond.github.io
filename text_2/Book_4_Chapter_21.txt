Poor Tara was heartbroken.  She lay on the ground, crying for her husband, Vali.  Hanuman, the wise monkey leader, gently touched her arm.

"Tara," he said softly, "everyone dies someday.  We should remember the good things about Vali. He was brave and fair. He followed the rules, and he was kind. Now he's in a better place. Don't be sad.  You have Angada, your strong son. He needs you now."

Hanuman explained that Angada should be king.  "Angada is a good monkey. He can rule the land well.  Thinking about the future and helping Angada is the best thing you can do now."

But Tara was still sad. "I'd rather be with Vali," she sobbed. "I don't want to be queen.  I can't rule the monkeys.  Sugriva, Vali's brother, should be king.  He's like a father to Angada.  I want to be with my husband, even though he's gone."

Hanuman understood Tara's sadness.  He knew that losing someone you love is very hard.  But he hoped she would eventually understand that she needed to be strong for her son and her people.
