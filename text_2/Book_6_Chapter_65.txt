King Ravana was worried.  Rama, a powerful prince, was fighting against him!  Ravana's brother, Kumbhakarna, was a giant warrior, but he was always sleeping!

Ravana's other brother, Mahodara, complained.  "Kumbhakarna needs to wake up and fight!" he said.

Kumbhakarna, finally awake, told Ravana, "I will defeat Rama!  I don't need to brag. I'll show you, not tell you!" He was angry that people were only talking, not fighting.

Ravana laughed. "Rama scared Mahodara! You, Kumbhakarna, are my strongest warrior! Go, defeat Rama!"

Kumbhakarna was happy to fight.  He was HUGE and strong!  Ravana gave Kumbhakarna shiny jewelry and a big, strong spear.

Kumbhakarna said, "I'll go alone! I'll eat the monkey army!"

Ravana said, "No! Take your army with you. Those monkeys are strong!"

So Kumbhakarna went to battle with his army.  He was so big, he looked like a mountain!  He was covered in jewels and carried a giant spear.

Kumbhakarna roared, "Today, I'll eat all the monkeys!"

The ground shook!  Scary clouds appeared.  Birds flew wildly.  Even the sun seemed dim! But Kumbhakarna wasn't scared.

He charged into the monkey army.  The monkeys were terrified! They scattered and ran. Kumbhakarna laughed, his voice like thunder!

He swung his giant club, and many monkeys fell.  He was so big and strong, the monkeys were afraid!  He was ready to fight Rama!
