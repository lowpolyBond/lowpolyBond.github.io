Once upon a time, a bird was very sad.  He’d lost his feathers and couldn't see! He flew to a wise old sage and cried.

The sage was kind. He said, “Don’t worry, little bird! Your feathers will grow back.  You’ll see again, and be strong again.”

The sage knew a big story was about to happen.  “A great king named Dasaratha will have a brave son named Rama,” he said. “Rama and his brother Lakshmana will go to the forest.  A bad king named Ravana will take Rama’s wife, Sita, away!”

“Sita will be very sad,” the sage continued.  “Even though she’ll be offered yummy food, she won’t eat.  Then, a powerful god named Indra will send her special food.  She’ll share it, hoping Rama and Lakshmana are safe.”

“Little bird,” the sage said, “Rama will send people to find Sita.  You must tell them what you know! Don’t leave. Your feathers will grow back soon. By waiting, you’ll help everyone – Rama, Lakshmana, and even the gods!”

“After I see Rama and Lakshmana,” the sage added, “I’ll be ready to die.”

The wise sage finished talking, and the little bird knew exactly what he had to do.
