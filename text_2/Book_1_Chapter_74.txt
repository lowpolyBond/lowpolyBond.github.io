Morning came, and the wise man Vishvamitra said goodbye to King Dasaratha and King Janaka. He blessed the princes – Rama, Lakshmana, and their brothers – and their father. Then he went to the mountains to think quietly.

After Vishvamitra left, King Dasaratha asked King Janaka if he could go home. King Janaka said goodbye and gave Dasaratha many gifts for his daughter's wedding:  lots of cows, beautiful clothes, sparkly elephants, horses, and chariots! He also gave him lots of gold, jewels, and servants.  Then, King Janaka went home.

King Dasaratha, his sons, and the wise men started their journey back.  Suddenly, they heard scary birds squawking!  Frightened deer ran across their path.

King Dasaratha was worried. He asked the wise man Vasishtha, "What do these bad signs mean?  I'm scared!"

Vasishtha said kindly, "The birds are bad, but the deer running from left to right means your fear will soon go away."

Suddenly, BOOM! The ground shook! Big trees fell down. It got dark and dusty.  Everyone in the army was scared, except King Dasaratha, his sons, and Vasishtha.

When the dust settled, they saw a scary man!  It was Parasurama. He looked very strong and angry, with a big axe and bow. He was like a burning fire!

The wise men whispered, "Parasurama is angry!  He might hurt us all!"  They worried because he was very strong and had hurt many people before.

They quickly gave Parasurama gifts to make him happy.  Then, Parasurama spoke to Rama…
