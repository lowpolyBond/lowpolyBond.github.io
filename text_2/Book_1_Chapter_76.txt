Rama was very polite.  A powerful man named Parasurama challenged him. Parasurama thought Rama wasn't strong enough.  Rama said, "I'll show you how strong I am!"

Rama took Parasurama's bow and arrow.  He was so strong, the bow almost broke! He aimed an arrow at Parasurama and said, "I won't kill you, but I can stop you from moving, or send you away. What do you want?"  Even the gods came to watch!  The world shook!

Parasurama was scared. He knew Rama was super strong, maybe even a god!  Parasurama explained, "A long time ago, I gave the earth to someone else.  I only visit during the day. Please, let me go back to my mountain home!"

Rama shot the arrow.  It didn't hurt Parasurama, but it took away his special powers. Parasurama quickly went back to his mountain.

The world was bright again.  The gods and wise men thanked Rama. Parasurama walked around Rama to show respect, and then went home.
