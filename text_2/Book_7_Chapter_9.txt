Long ago, a scary giant named Sumali lived under the ground. He looked like a dark cloud and wore shiny gold earrings. He found a beautiful girl who looked like a princess.  Sumali saw a shining prince, Kubera, riding in a magical flying chariot.  Sumali was so scared of the prince that he quickly went back underground.

Sumali thought, "How can we become stronger?" He talked to his daughter, Kaikasi.  "My dear daughter," he said, "it's time you got married.  I worry about you.  You're so pretty, like a princess!  Let's find you a good husband.  Marry Vishravas, a wise and powerful man.  Your children will be just as strong as Kubera!"

Kaikasi listened to her father. She went to find Vishravas, who was praying to the gods. She was shy and stood quietly.

Vishravas asked, "Who are you, my child? Why have you come?"

Kaikasi said, "My father sent me, great wise man. My name is Kaikasi."

Vishravas knew why she was there. He said, "You want to have children with me. But your children will be dark and scary, like giants."

Kaikasi begged, "Please, I don't want bad children!"

Vishravas said, "Your last child will be good, like me."

Kaikasi had several children. Her first son was a terrible giant with ten heads!  He was named Ravana.  The earth shook when he was born!  Then came a giant brother, Kumbhakarna, who was always hungry.  There was also a mean sister, Shurpanakha.  But her last son, Vibhishana, was kind and good.  Flowers rained down when he was born.

Ravana and Kumbhakarna grew very strong and mean.  Kumbhakarna ate anything he could find!  Vibhishana was good and kind.

Ravana's mother saw his brother, Kubera, shining brightly. "My son," she said, "look how powerful your brother is! You should be strong, too!"

Ravana was angry. He promised to become even stronger than Kubera! He and Kumbhakarna prayed very hard.  The gods were so impressed, they gave Ravana powerful magic.
