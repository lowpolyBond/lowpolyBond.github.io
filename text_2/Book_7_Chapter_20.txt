Once upon a time, a powerful demon king named Ravana ruled the land.  He was very scary, and everyone was afraid of him!

One day, a wise and holy man named Narada flew by on a cloud.  Ravana saw him and asked, "Why are you here?"

Narada said, "Ravana, you are strong and brave!  You've defeated many enemies. But why do you scare everyone?  This world is full of sadness and sickness. People are happy and sad all the time. Why fight a world that's already hurting?"

Narada explained, "Instead of fighting people, you should fight death itself! Death is the real enemy.  If you can defeat death, youâ€™ll be truly powerful!"

Ravana laughed, "I will conquer death! I'll go to the land of the dead and defeat the king, Yama!"

Ravana was very proud.  He said he would even defeat the gods!

Narada watched Ravana go. He wondered, "How can anyone defeat death? It's impossible!"  He was very curious to see what would happen.
