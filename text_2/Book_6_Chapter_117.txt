Hanuman, a very clever monkey, bowed to Rama.  Rama's eyes were as beautiful as lotus flowers. Hanuman said, "Rama, you should see Sita. She's very sad. This whole adventure was to save her. She heard you won and wants to see you again. She told me, 'I want to see my husband!'"

Rama's heart melted. He cried. He told Vibhishana, who looked like a big, fluffy cloud, "Go get Sita!  She should be all clean and pretty, with nice jewelry."

Vibhishana quickly went to find Sita.  He bowed to her and said, "Sita, please get ready. Rama wants to see you!"

Sita said, "I want to see him now, even if I haven't had a bath yet."

Vibhishana said, "Rama wants you to get ready." Sita, who loved Rama very much, said, "Okay."

Sita, looking beautiful in her best clothes and jewelry, rode in a fancy palanquin carried by strong giants.  Vibhishana brought her to Rama.

Vibhishana told Rama that Sita had arrived.  Rama, happy but also wanting to test Sita, pretended not to be so happy. He said, "Bring Sita closer, Vibhishana."

Vibhishana told everyone to move back.  There was a big noisy crowd of monkeys, giants, and soldiers.  Rama felt bad that they were being sent away.  He said to Vibhishana,  "Why are you making them all leave? They're my friends! People should see Sita with me.  It's okay for everyone to see her."

Vibhishana understood. He brought Sita to Rama. Lakshmana, Hanuman, and Sugriva were sad that Rama had been angry.

Sita, a little shy, walked to Rama.  Seeing Rama's face, as bright as the moon, Sita forgot all her worries.  Her face shone as brightly as the moon too!  She was so happy to see her husband again!
