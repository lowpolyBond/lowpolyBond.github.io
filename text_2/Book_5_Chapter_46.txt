King Ravana was angry!  His soldiers had been beaten by a strong monkey.  He was scared, but he pretended not to be. He had a plan.

Ravana called his best fighters: Virupaksha, Yupaksha, Durdharsha, Praghasa, and Basakarna.  They were super-fast and brave.  "Go!" he roared. "Capture that monkey! He's not just any monkey. He might be a magic warrior sent to defeat us!  Use your horses, chariots, and elephants! Get him!"

These strong warriors rushed to battle. They saw Hanuman, the monkey, standing tall and strong.  He looked like the sun!  They were a little scared.

Durdharsha shot many arrows at Hanuman's head.  Hanuman just jumped! He was so strong, he made the sky shake with his yell.  Durdharsha shot more arrows, but Hanuman dodged them all!  Then, ZOOM! Hanuman smashed Durdharsha's chariot! The warrior fell to the ground.

Virupaksha and Yupaksha attacked next, but Hanuman was too quick. He grabbed a giant tree and beat them!  He was super strong!

Praghasa and Basakarna laughed and tried to fight Hanuman, but the monkey was furious! He ripped off the top of a mountain, with all the trees and animals on it, and crushed them!  

Hanuman was so powerful, he defeated all of Ravana's soldiers. He smashed their chariots and elephants.  The battlefield was full of broken things and dead soldiers.  Finally, Hanuman stood at the gate, tired but victorious.  He was ready for anything!
