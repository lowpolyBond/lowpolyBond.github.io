King Dasaratha had a big party!  He did a special ceremony, and when it was over, everyone went home.  The gods went back to the sky.  The king went back to his city, Ayodhya, with his wives and soldiers.  Everyone got presents before they left.

Six seasons later, something wonderful happened!  The stars were shining brightly, and it was a very special day.  Queen Kaushalya had a baby boy! His name was Rama. He was a very special baby,  like a god!

Queen Kaikeyi had a baby boy too, named Bharata.  He was also very special.  Queen Sumitra had twin boys, Lakshmana and Shatrughna.  All the babies were handsome and strong.

When the babies were born, there was a big party!  The whole city celebrated.  There was music, dancing, and lots of food.  King Dasaratha gave everyone lots of gifts.

The princes, Rama, Bharata, Lakshmana, and Shatrughna, grew up to be strong and brave.  They learned to fight and ride horses and elephants. Rama was the best of them all, kind and brave.  Rama and Lakshmana were best friends. They did everything together.  Bharata and Shatrughna were best friends, too.

One day, a very important holy man, Sage Vishvamitra, came to visit King Dasaratha. He was a powerful and wise man.  King Dasaratha was so happy to see him! He welcomed Vishvamitra and asked what he needed.  Vishvamitra said he had a very important job for Rama.
