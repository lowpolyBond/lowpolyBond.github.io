Lakshmana, Rama's brother, was very angry!  He was shouting at Sugriva, the monkey king.

Tara, Sugriva's beautiful wife, spoke calmly.  "Lakshmana," she said, "you're being too harsh. Sugriva isn't ungrateful or a liar! He's a good king."

Tara reminded Lakshmana that Rama had helped Sugriva win back his kingdom.  Sugriva was just very happy to be king again! He'd been sad and tired for so long.  He needed some time to relax. "Rama should understand," she said.  "And you, Lakshmana, shouldn't be so angry so quickly."

Tara explained that Sugriva would do anything for Rama.  He would give up everything â€“ his kingdom, his family, even his wife and son!  He just needed a little more time.

"To rescue Sita from Ravana," Tara continued, "Sugriva needs help.  Ravana has many, many strong demons in Lanka. Sugriva can't fight them all alone.  Even Bali, the old monkey king, said so!"

Sugriva is waiting for a huge army of monkeys and bears to gather.  They're coming today!  Then, they will all go to Lanka together to help Rama.

"Lakshmana," Tara pleaded, "please calm down.  Your anger scares everyone.  Be patient, and wait for the army."
