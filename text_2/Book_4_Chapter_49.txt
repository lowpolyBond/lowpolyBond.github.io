Angada, a very smart monkey, talked to all the other monkeys.  He was tired, but he told them to be brave.

"We looked everywhere!" he said. "We searched forests, mountains, rivers, and caves. We still haven't found Sita, or that mean Ravana who took her!  We don't have much time left. Sugriva, our king, will be very angry if we fail.  Let's search again!  Let's look even harder this time.  If we work together, we can find Sita!"

Gandhamadana, another monkey who was very thirsty and tired, agreed. "Angada is right!" he said. "Let's search the hills, caves, and waterfalls. Let's find Sita!"

The monkeys were strong and brave. They started searching the Vindhya mountains.  The mountains were tall and covered in trees.  They climbed and climbed, searching everywhere.  They were very tired, but they still couldn't find Sita.

They rested for a little bit under a tree.  Then, they felt a little better and started searching again.  Finally, Hanuman, the strongest monkey of all, led them back to the Vindhya mountains to search once more.
