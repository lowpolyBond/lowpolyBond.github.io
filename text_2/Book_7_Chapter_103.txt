Once upon a time, a very old, wise-looking man came to see Rama, the kind and strong prince.  He said, "I'm a messenger from a powerful holy man.  I have an important message for you."

Lakshmana, Rama's brother, hurried to tell Rama, "A special messenger is here! He's as bright as the sun!"

Rama said, "Please bring him in, Lakshmana."

Lakshmana brought the old man, who was shining like he was surrounded by sunlight.  The old man greeted Rama and asked him how he was.  Rama was polite and offered him a seat.

Then Rama said, "Welcome, wise man. What is your important message?"

The old man whispered, "This message is secret. Only you and I should hear it.  If anyone else listens, you must punish them."

Rama agreed. He told Lakshmana, "Guard the door, brother. Send the guard away.  If anyone hears our secret talk, you must stop them."

Lakshmana stood guard.  Then Rama said to the old man, "Now tell me your secret message. I will keep it safe."
