Rama was talking to his brother Bharata.  A wise man named Javali came along and said something different.  Javali said, "Rama, you're a smart prince, but don't be sad.  Friends and family are like travelers staying at an inn.  They are with you for a little while, then they go.  Your father, King Dasaratha, is gone.  He's like a traveler who left his inn.  

"Don't be sad! Your father's kingdom is waiting for you.  Go back to Ayodhya! Be a happy king!  Enjoy your life!  You are not your father, and he is not you.  

"People say you should do things for your dead relatives, like giving food to the priests. But does food really reach the dead?  It’s silly!  It’s like saying that if someone eats your food, you don't need to eat anymore!  Wise people made up those rules to get things from others.

"There is only this life, Rama. Be happy! Enjoy your kingdom!  Don't be sad; be a king!"
