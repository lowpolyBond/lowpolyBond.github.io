Rama and his brother Lakshmana saw Bharata in the forest.  Bharata was dressed simply, like someone who lived a quiet life.  "Bharata," Rama asked, "why are you here? Why have you left your palace and come to the forest?"

Bharata was sad.  He explained, "My father, the king, died because of what my mother did. She made him very upset.  She was wrong, and now she's very unhappy too.  But I am your servant, Rama. Please, become king! The people want you, and my mother wants you."

Bharata begged Rama to be king. He said, "You are the eldest brother.  You should be king. The land will be happy with you as its ruler."  Bharata bowed down to Rama, his eyes full of tears.

Rama hugged Bharata.  "Bharata," Rama said, "you are a good person, but don't speak badly about your mother. We must always obey our parents. My father sent me to the forest, and I must obey him."

Rama continued, "You should be king.  I will stay in the forest for fourteen years. This is what my father wanted. I must do what he asked."

Rama refused to be king. He said being king without following his father's wishes wouldn't feel right. Bharata, though heartbroken, went back to the city to become king. Rama stayed in the forest.
