Rama and his brother Lakshmana were fighting a terrible battle.  Big, sharp arrows hit them both. They fell to the ground, hurt and bleeding.  Rama's monkey friends were very sad.

Rama woke up. He saw Lakshmana lying still, covered in blood and arrows.  Rama cried. "What good is Sita, or even my life, if Lakshmana is hurt? I can find another wife, but I can never find another brother like him! If Lakshmana dies, I will die too!"

Rama was very upset. He worried about telling his mother and his other family.  He thought, "How can I face them?  Lakshmana was so brave, so kind, and so helpful.  He always helped me."

Rama was sad that Lakshmana was hurt because of him.  He felt it was his fault. He said, "Lakshmana, you always helped me. Now you are hurt, and I can't help you! You were so strong, so skilled with a bow and arrow.  Now you lie here, hurt and bleeding."

Rama was so heartbroken. He even blamed himself for not making Bibishana king sooner. He told his monkey friends, "I have to go.  Please, go back home, Sugriva. I need to be with Lakshmana."  The monkeys were all crying, too.

Just then, Bibishana came running. The monkeys thought he was one of Ravanaâ€™s soldiers, so they all ran away!  Bibishana looked just like a giant blob of dark kohl.
