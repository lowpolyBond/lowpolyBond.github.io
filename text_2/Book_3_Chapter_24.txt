Rama and his brother Lakshmana lived in a peaceful forest.  One day, bad things started happening!  The sky turned dark and stormy, and rained blood! Rama's arrows started to glow, and his bow moved all by itself!  He knew something big was coming.

Rama said to Lakshmana, "My brother, a huge battle is about to start!  A scary demon army is coming.  To keep you safe, please take Sita to a secret cave in the mountains.  I'll fight the demons alone."

Lakshmana loved his brother, so he took Sita to the cave.  Rama put on his shiny armor, picked up his bow and arrow, and made a loud noise that echoed everywhere.  The gods and other magical beings watched from above.  They were worried!  Rama was going to fight fourteen thousand demons all by himself!

Then, the demon army arrived!  They were loud and scary. They yelled and waved their weapons. The animals in the forest ran away.

Rama stood alone, but he wasnâ€™t afraid. He was strong and brave like a god. He grabbed his arrows, aimed his bow, and let out a huge yell. He looked like a giant fire, ready to fight!

The demons rushed at Rama, but he was ready.  He was a great warrior, and he was going to fight for what was right. The battle was about to begin!
