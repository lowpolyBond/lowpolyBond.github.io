The monkeys finally reached the ocean!  It was HUGE and scary, with giant waves crashing all around.  They were very, very far from home.

They had been searching for Sita for a whole month.  The king, Sugriva, had given them a deadline, and they had missed it! They were sitting under some beautiful trees, feeling sad and worried.  All the pretty flowers made them feel even worse.

Prince Angada, a strong and smart monkey, spoke up.  "We've failed," he said sadly.  "Sugriva is a strict king, and he'll be very angry. We promised to find Sita, and we didn't.  He might even kill us!"

The other monkeys were scared, too. They all agreed:  "If we go back without Sita, Sugriva will be furious!  It's better to die here than face his anger!"

Then, a clever monkey named Tara had an idea.  "Let's go back to the magical cave!" he shouted.  "It's full of food and water, and nobody can find us there!"

Angada liked this plan.  All the monkeys cheered! "Yes!" they cried. "Let's go to the cave and hide!"  They felt much better, ready to try again later.
