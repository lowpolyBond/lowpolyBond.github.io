Rama, the good prince, was going to the forest.  Everyone loved Rama!  The people of Ayodhya, his city, followed him.  They cried and begged him to stay.  Even though his dad, King Dasaratha, told him to go, the people didn't want him to leave!

Rama was kind. He told the people, "Please love my brother Bharata as much as you love me. He's good and kind, and he'll be a great king."  But the people still wanted Rama. They followed him like little ducklings follow their mother.

Old wise men called out, "Rama, please come back!  Your horses, please turn around!"  They were so sad.

Rama stopped his chariot.  He and his wife, Sita, and his brother, Lakshmana, walked.  The people walked with them.  Rama felt sad to see the old men walking.

The wise men said, "Rama, we'll carry your holy things! We'll protect you from the sun! We're coming with you!" Even the birds and trees seemed sad, wanting Rama to stay!  They all loved Rama very, very much.

The river Tamasa was in their way.  Sumantra, Rama's driver, let the tired horses rest and drink water from the river.  The people's journey with Rama was far from over.
