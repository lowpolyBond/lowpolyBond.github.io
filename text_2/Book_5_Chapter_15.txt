Hanuman, the monkey king, was searching for Sita. He found a beautiful garden! It was even more amazing than the magical Nandana Gardens of the gods.  Lots of colorful birds flew around.  Pretty flowers covered the trees.  There were sparkling pools and shiny palaces.  The garden smelled wonderful.

Hanuman looked and looked, never getting tired of the beautiful sight.  The trees were covered with blossoms, so many that they almost touched the ground.  It was like a rainbow of colors.  The garden was so beautiful, it felt like another heaven!

In the garden, he saw a big, white temple, shining like the snowy mountain Kailasha.  It was huge and sparkly!

Then, he saw her! Sita was there. She looked sad and thin. Her clothes were dirty.  She was surrounded by mean female giants. Sita looked very unhappy.  She missed Rama and Lakshmana very much.

Sita was wearing a worn-out yellow dress.  She didn't have any jewelry. She looked like a beautiful flower that had lost its petals.  Her long, dark hair fell down her back.  She was crying.

Hanuman knew, even though she looked different, that this was Sita. He saw some of her jewelry â€“ it was dusty, but he recognized it.  He remembered what Rama had told him about her jewelry.  He also saw that she was still beautiful.  Even though she was sad and thin, her beauty shone through.

Hanuman knew he had found her. He silently bowed his head to Sita and thought of Rama. He was ready to tell Rama that he had found Sita!
