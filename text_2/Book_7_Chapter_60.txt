One morning, after sunrise, King Dasharatha got ready for his day.  His driver, Sumantra, came to him.  "King," said Sumantra, "some holy wise men are waiting outside. They're led by a very important sage named Cyavana. They want to see you!"

King Dasharatha's son, Rama, said, "Let them come in!"  Sumantra bowed and led over one hundred wise men into the palace. They carried special water and gifts of fruit. Rama happily accepted the gifts.

Rama was very kind. He said to the wise men, "Please, sit wherever you like."  He bowed to them.  Then he asked, "Why have you come?  I will do anything I can to help you! My whole kingdom is yours!"

The wise men were so happy to hear this!  They said, "Rama, you're the best!  Most kings are scared of hard things. But you, without even knowing what we need, promised to help.  We need your help to save us from great danger!"
