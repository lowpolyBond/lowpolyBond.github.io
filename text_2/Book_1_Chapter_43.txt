Once upon a time, there was a king named Bhagiratha. He wanted the holy river Ganga to come to Earth.  He really, really wanted this! So, he stood on one leg for a whole year and prayed to Lord Shiva.

Lord Shiva was happy with King Bhagiratha's hard work. He said, "I'll bring Ganga down!"  Ganga, a powerful river, came rushing down from the mountains and landed on Lord Shiva's head!  It was so strong, it almost knocked him over!

Lord Shiva was very strong, though! He caught Ganga in his hair.  Ganga spun around and around in his hair for a long, long time. She couldn't get out!

King Bhagiratha prayed again.  Finally, Lord Shiva let Ganga go. She flowed down, splitting into seven streams! Some flowed east, some flowed west, and one followed King Bhagiratha's chariot.

The gods and goddesses came to watch in their flying chariots! It was a magical sight! Fish jumped, and the water sparkled like a thousand suns.

Everyone who touched the Ganga's water was cleaned of their bad deeds.  People who were punished and lived on Earth went back to heaven, all clean!

Ganga flowed and flowed.  She even went past a powerful sage named Jahnu, who was performing a special ceremony.  Jahnu was angry because Ganga was a bit bossy, so he drank all the water!  That was amazing!

But Jahnu was kind. He let Ganga flow out of his ears!  Now, she's also called Jahnavi. She kept flowing until she reached the ocean.

Finally, King Bhagiratha reached his ancestors' ashes. When Ganga touched them, they came back to life! They were clean and went to heaven.  King Bhagiratha was very happy.  And that's the story of how Ganga came to Earth!
