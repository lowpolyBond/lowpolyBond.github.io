Once upon a time, in a faraway land, a beautiful princess named Sita was missing.  A brave monkey named Hanuman met Sita.  Sita, very sad, asked Hanuman, "Where is my husband, Rama, and his brother Lakshmana?  Tell me about them, please!"

Hanuman happily told her, "I met Rama and Lakshmana in the forest. Rama is very handsome!  He has eyes like lotus flowers, a face like the moon, and is strong and kind. Heâ€™s wise and brave, like a great king should be.  Lakshmana is just as good, though he has a golden skin, while Rama's is darker. They are searching for you!"

Hanuman explained how Rama and Lakshmana had helped the monkey king, Sugriva, who was sad and alone.  Sugriva was so grateful that he helped Rama and Lakshmana find Sita.  Hanuman continued, "The monkeys searched everywhere.  We even crossed a huge mountain!  Then, we learned from a bird that you were here!"

Hanuman said he had flown across a wide ocean to reach Sita.  "I saw you and Ravana, the bad king who took you away.  Don't worry, Rama will come to rescue you soon! He'll defeat Ravana and bring you home."

Sita was so happy to hear this news!  She was sure that Hanuman was a real messenger from Rama.  She smiled, and happy tears rolled down her cheeks. She knew that soon, she would see Rama again.  Hanuman said, "I can do more for you, Sita. Just tell me!"  He promised to help her in any way he could before he returned to Rama.
