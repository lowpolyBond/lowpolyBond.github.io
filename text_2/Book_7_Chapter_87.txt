Once upon a time, a very strong and kind king named Ila ruled a big kingdom.  He was so powerful that everyone, even the gods and magical creatures, were afraid of him!  He treated his people like his own children.

One day, Ila went hunting in a beautiful forest.  He killed many, many animals, but he still wasn't tired!  He came to a special place where the mighty god Shiva was playing with the goddess Parvati.  Shiva had magic!  He changed everything in the forest into a girl, even the trees!

When King Ila arrived, he saw only female animals.  Then, he realized *he* had also changed into a girl! He was very scared.  He went to Shiva and Parvati.

Shiva laughed and said, "King Ila, you can ask for anything you want, except to be a man again forever!"

King Ila was so upset because he wanted to be a man again!  He asked Parvati for help.  She was very kind and said, "We'll grant half your wish each.  You'll be a man for one month, and then a woman for the next month."

So, that's what happened!  For one month, King Ila was a man, and the next month, he was a woman named Ila. And he wouldn't remember being the other gender during each month.  He became the most beautiful woman in the whole world!  The magic of the gods was truly amazing.
