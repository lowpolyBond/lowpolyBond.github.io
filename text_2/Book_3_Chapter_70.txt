Rama and Lakshmana, two brave princes, were walking through a dark forest.  Suddenly, they saw a scary giant! This giant, named Kabandha, had a huge body and arms like tree trunks.

Kabandha said, "I'm very hungry!  You two will be my dinner!"

Lakshmana, even though he was scared, said to Rama, "Brother, this giant is mean!  Let's fight him! We can't let him eat us like animals!"

Rama and Lakshmana were quick!  They swung their swords.  *Swish!*  *Swish!*  They chopped off Kabandha's giant arms!

Kabandha screamed, a loud, scary sound like thunder. He fell to the ground, hurt and bleeding.  He weakly asked, "Who are you?"

Lakshmana answered, "I'm Lakshmana, and this is my brother Rama.  We're looking for Rama's wife, Sita, who was taken away by a wicked giant."

Kabandha was surprised! He remembered an old prophecy. He said, "You have helped me! Cutting off my arms broke a terrible curse!  I used to be a powerful being, but I was punished for being mean.  Thank you for freeing me!"  He then told Rama and Lakshmana all about the wicked giant who took Sita and how to find her.
