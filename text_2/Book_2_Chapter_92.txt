Prince Bharata had a fun night at the wise man's house.  In the morning, he wanted to see his brother Rama.

He bowed politely to the wise man, who was doing a special fire ceremony.  "Prince," the wise man asked, "Did you have a good night?  Was everything alright?"

Bharata bowed again. "Yes, thank you! Everyone in my army was happy. We slept well and ate delicious food.  We're ready to go see my brother.  Can you tell me how to get to Rama's house?"

The wise man smiled. "Go ten miles. You'll see a mountain called Cittrakuta, with lots of rocks.  North of that mountain, is the Mandakini River.  Follow the river, and you'll find Rama and his brother Lakshmana in a small hut on the mountain."  He pointed. "Take the right path, past the river. It'll lead you right to Rama."

Bharata's mothers came to say goodbye to the wise man.  Kaushalya and Sumitra were sad, but Kaikeyi, who had made Rama go away, looked ashamed.  Bharata told the wise man how sad his family was. He explained that Kaikeyi was his mother, but she was the reason Rama was gone.  Bharata was very upset.

The wise man said, "Don't blame Kaikeyi.  Rama going to the forest will do good things.  It will help many people."

Bharata thanked the wise man and got ready to leave.  His army was huge! There were horses, elephants with beautiful decorations, and shiny chariots.  Bharata rode in a special palanquin that sparkled like the sun.  The whole army marched through the forest, a giant, shining wave of people and animals.  Bharata was on his way to see his brother.
