Hanuman, the super-strong monkey, got ready to jump across the huge ocean!  It was four hundred miles wide!  The other monkeys cheered. They were so happy and excited!  Even the gods were amazed!

Hanuman grew HUGE!  He wagged his tail and showed off his muscles. He looked like a lion getting ready to roar! His mouth opened wide, like a fiery furnace!

Then Hanuman bowed to the older monkeys. "I am the son of the wind god," he said. "I'm super strong! I could run around Mount Meru a thousand times without stopping! I could even make the whole ocean overflow! I could reach the sun and come back before it sets!  I can jump higher than the stars! I'll cross the ocean and find Sita!"

The other monkeys were amazed! Jambavan, a wise old monkey, said, "Hanuman, you're our hero! We'll wait for you!"

Hanuman climbed Mount Mahendra, a giant mountain.  The mountain shook as he climbed!  Even the birds and animals were scared!  Hanuman was so strong!

Hanuman stood at the top. He was ready to jump. He was already thinking about reaching Lanka, where Sita was being held!  He was going to save her! The end.
