Rama's brother, Bharata, was very sad.  He spoke to Rama, saying, "What good is being king if I'm not a good person?  Our family has a rule: the older brother must be king. Rama, please come back home to Ayodhya with me!  Be our king!"

Bharata explained, "Kings aren't just people; they're like gods because they do what's right and good.  While you were in the forest, our father, King Dasaratha, died of sadness. He missed you so much!  Shatrughna and I already did the special ceremony for our father, but you need to do it too, Rama.  A son's ceremony helps their father go to heaven peacefully.  You were your father's favorite, and he died because he missed you so much!"
