Bharata, hearing these words of Rama, replied: “What will the discharge of royal duties avail me, who am destitute of all virtue? O Great One, according to the tradition of our line, the younger brother may not be king while the elder lives, therefore, O Raghava, return with me to the auspicious city of Ayodhya and for the sake of our family, cause thyself to be installed as king. Some may consider the king a man, but I hold him to be a god, since his conduct differs from others, being inspired by duty and divine grace. When I was at the home of my maternal uncle and you exiled to the forest, King Dasaratha, adored by the good, the performer of spiritual sacrifices, departed to heaven. As soon as you, with Sita and Lakshmana, hadst left the capital, the king overwhelmed by sorrow and affliction, passed away. O Chief of Men, offer the traditional libations for your father; Shatrughna and I have already carried out this ritual. O Prince, it is said that the water and rice offered by a beloved son, grants imperishable bliss to one departed. O Raghava, you wast indeed the beloved of your royal father; through grief on your account and the desire to see you, your sire, his mind unceasingly fixed on you, overcome by sorrow, departed to heaven.”
