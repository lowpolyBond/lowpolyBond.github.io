Rama and his family were leaving their home in Ayodhya.  Rama said goodbye to the city. He loved Ayodhya, and he promised to return.  He hugged his people and told them to go home.  They were all very sad to see him go.  They cried and cried.  Rama was sad too, but he knew he had to leave.  He told his driver to go quickly so he wouldn't see the people crying.

Rama traveled in his chariot. He saw many happy villages and towns. People were kind and good. There were beautiful gardens, lots of animals, and everyone sang religious songs.  He saw the amazing river Ganga. It was so beautiful!  The water was clear and cool.  There were holy men and magical creatures near the river.  The river was sparkling and full of life, like a happy, playful woman.

Rama and his friends stopped to rest under a big tree near the river.  A kind man named Guha, who was the king of the boatmen, welcomed them. Guha offered Rama and his friends a big feast. But Rama was living simply, so he only accepted grass for his horses.  Guha was happy to help.

That night, Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita slept under the tree. Guha and Sumantra stayed awake, watching over them. Rama slept peacefully, even though he was sad to be away from his home.
