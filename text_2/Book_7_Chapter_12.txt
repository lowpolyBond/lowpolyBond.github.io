Once upon a time, a powerful demon king named Ravana, with his brother, decided to find wives for themselves and their sister, Shurpanakha.  They gave Shurpanakha to another demon king.

That same night, Ravana went hunting. He saw Maya, a magic-using man, walking in the forest with a beautiful young woman.

"Who are you?" roared Ravana.  "And who is this lovely girl with you?"

Maya explained, "My name is Maya.  I used to live in a beautiful golden city with my wife, Hema, but the gods took her away.  Years later, I built a new city, but I was still sad.  Now, I'm looking for a husband for my daughter, Mandodari."

Ravana, whose real name was Dashagriva (Ten-headed), said politely, "I'm from a powerful family!  My father was a very wise and good sage."

Maya was so impressed that he happily gave his daughter, Mandodari, to marry Ravana! He even gave Ravana a special magic spear.  

Ravana then found wives for his brothers too. One brother married Vajravala, and the other married Sarama.  Sarama got her name because her mother once cried, "Don't overflow!" to a big lake when Sarama was a baby.

The demons all lived happily with their new wives.  Then, Mandodari gave birth to a baby boy who roared like thunder!  Ravana named him Meghanada (Thunder-sound), and he grew up to be a very powerful demon.
