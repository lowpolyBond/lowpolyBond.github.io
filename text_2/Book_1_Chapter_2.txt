Once upon a time, a very wise man named Valmiki was talking to his friend Bharadvaja.  They had heard a wonderful story from Narada, a traveling storyteller, and were amazed!  Narada then flew away to the heavens.

Valmiki and Bharadvaja went to a beautiful river.  Valmiki said, "Bharadvaja, this water is so clear and clean! Go get my special robe from our home, I want to take a bath." Bharadvaja quickly got the robe.

Valmiki bathed in the river, and then walked in the forest.  He saw two beautiful birds, called Krauncha birds, playing together.  Suddenly, a hunter shot one of the birds!  The other bird cried sadly.

Valmiki felt very sorry for the bird. He was angry at the hunter and said, "Hunter, you were mean! Because of this, you will not be happy."

Valmiki thought, "Those were strange words!  They sounded like a poem!" He told Bharadvaja, "I think I just wrote a poem!"  Bharadvaja was happy for his teacher.

Valmiki bathed again and went home.  He prayed, and suddenly, a very important god, Brahma, appeared! Brahma told Valmiki, "Your poem was amazing!  Write a long poem about Rama, a very good king. Your story will be famous for as long as the world exists!"

Brahma disappeared, and Valmiki and Bharadvaja were very excited!  Valmiki decided to write the whole story of Rama, a wonderful and exciting tale. And that's how the Ramayana, a very long and famous story, began!
