A dark storm came.  Rain fell, but it wasn't water! It was blood! Khara's horses stumbled.  The sun looked scary â€“ dark and red like burning coals.  A big vulture landed on his flag.

Animals screamed.  Jackals howled terribly.  More dark clouds came, like giant elephants. They rained blood, making everything dark and spooky. It got dark early, like twilight.  Scary birds and animals blocked Khara's way.

Even though it wasn't nighttime, the sun was dim.  Stars appeared!  The flowers and fruit fell off the trees.  The earth shook!  Parrots cried out in fear.  

Khara's arm twitched. His voice went away.  He saw all this, but he didn't stop.  He laughed!  "These scary things are nothing compared to me!" he shouted.  "I can even shoot down stars! I'll defeat Rama and Lakshmana, and my sister will drink their blood! I've never lost a battle before!"

Khara's army cheered.  They were ready to fight.

Good people, like wise saints and gods, watched. They prayed that Rama, just like the god Vishnu, would win the battle. They wanted Rama to be safe.

Then Khara, with his twelve strongest fighters, rushed towards Rama and Lakshmana.  Their army charged like planets rushing toward the sun!
