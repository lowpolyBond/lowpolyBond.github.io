Prince Rama was kind and gentle.  The king asked him to leave the palace and live in the forest for fourteen years.  Rama said, "I don't need an army or riches in the forest.  I only need simple clothes, a spade to dig for food, and baskets."

Queen Kaikeyi, who had asked the king to send Rama away, gave Rama bark clothes to wear. Rama took off his fancy clothes and put on the bark clothes.  His brother Lakshmana did the same.

Princess Sita, Rama's wife, was sad. She had beautiful silk clothes, but she was given bark clothes too. She didn't know how to wear them!  Rama helped her put them on.

Many people cried. They begged Rama not to take Sita to the forest. They said, "Sita is too precious for the forest!  Let her stay here!"

But Sita wanted to go with Rama.  She loved him very much and wouldn't leave him.

The wise teacher, Vasishtha, was upset with Queen Kaikeyi. He said, "You only asked for Rama to leave! Sita doesn't have to go! She should wear beautiful clothes and travel in a royal carriage."

But Sita didn't change her mind. She wanted to wear simple clothes like Rama and go with him to the forest.  Even though everyone wanted her to stay, Sita decided to follow her husband.  She loved him too much to leave him alone.
