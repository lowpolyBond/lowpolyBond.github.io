Long ago, a powerful being named Death came to visit Rama, a great king. Death wasn't scary, though! He was actually sent by Brahma, the creator of the universe.  Brahma is like a super, super grandpa to everyone.

Death told Rama, "Brahma says it's time for you to come home! You've done a wonderful job protecting the world. You've been here for a long, long time, helping everyone."

Brahma had given Rama a special job a long time ago. He helped create the world and protect it.  He explained Rama had even helped create huge snakes and powerful beings. Now it was time for Rama to return to live with the gods again.

Brahma said, "Rama, you've helped everyone.  If you come back, the gods will be very happy!"

Rama smiled. He was happy to hear from Brahma. Rama said, "I came to help the world, and I did my best. I'm ready to go back to the gods. Thank you for coming to tell me!"

Then Rama, with a happy heart, prepared to return to his home amongst the gods.
