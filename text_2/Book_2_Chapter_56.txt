One morning, Rama woke up. He gently woke his brother Lakshmana.  "Lakshmana," he said, "listen to all the beautiful birds singing! It's time for us to travel to Cittrakuta!"

Lakshmana woke up and they all went to the Yamuna River to wash and pray. Then, they walked through a forest with pretty orange flowers.  Rama pointed to the flowers and trees.  "Sita, look at these beautiful blossoms! And Lakshmana, look at those huge honeycombs!"  He described the pretty birds and the flowers covering the ground.  "Cittrakuta is a wonderful mountain with lots of birds and elephants.  We'll find a nice place to live there."

They walked and talked until they reached Cittrakuta.  It was a lovely place, full of trees, fruits, and clear pools of water.  "This is perfect, Lakshmana," Rama said. "Itâ€™s peaceful, and there are wise people living here in the forest too!"

They went to meet a wise man named Valmiki. Valmiki welcomed them warmly. Rama told Valmiki why they were living in the forest. Then Rama said to Lakshmana, "Let's build a hut here!"

Lakshmana quickly gathered wood and built a strong hut.  "It's finished!" he said proudly. Rama said, "Let's offer a special meal to bless our new home. Lakshmana, please hunt a deer."

Lakshmana hunted a deer and cooked it.  Then Rama prayed to the gods and offered the deer meat as a gift.  He also prayed for peace and happiness in their new home.

Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana moved into their cozy leaf hut.  They lived happily in the forest, surrounded by trees, animals, and birds. They loved their peaceful new home on Mount Cittrakuta, near the Malati River. They hardly thought about their old home anymore.
