After King Amshuman died, his people chose a new king, a good man named Dilipa.  Dilipa's dad, Amshuman, had been a great king!  He went to live high in the mountains and spent many, many years praying.

Dilipa was sad because his uncles hadn't been able to bring the sacred Ganga River down to earth. He wanted to do it for them. He thought about it every day!  Dilipa wished for a son to help.  Then, he had a baby boy named Bhagiratha!

Dilipa ruled for a very long time, but he still worried about his family.  Then he died, and Bhagiratha became king. Bhagiratha was a good king, too, but he wanted a son.  He wanted to bring the Ganga River down to help his ancestors.

So, Bhagiratha went to a special place and prayed very hard.  He stood in five fires! He only ate once a month! He did this for a whole thousand years!

Finally, a powerful god named Brahma saw Bhagiratha.  Brahma said, "You've prayed very hard!  Ask for anything you want!"

Bhagiratha said, "Please help me bring the Ganga River down. I want to help my family, and I need a son!"

Brahma smiled.  "You've asked for a big wish. The Ganga is very powerful! Only Lord Shiva can help with that."  Then Brahma went away.  Bhagiratha's big wish would take more work, but it would come true!
