Shurpanakha, the mean demoness, complained to her brother Khara.  Khara was furious!  He yelled, "That Rama! He's as good as dead! I'll kill him and his brother today! Don't cry, sister!"

Shurpanakha was happy. She praised her big, strong brother.

Khara then told his best friend, Dushana, "Get my army ready!  Fourteen THOUSAND demons!  They’re strong and mean! They love to fight!  Get my awesome chariot too – it’s shiny and gold!"

Dushana quickly got the chariot. It was huge and beautiful, like a mountain of gold!  It had amazing horses.

Khara climbed onto his chariot.  He looked down at his army and shouted, "Attack!"

The fourteen thousand demons charged! They had all sorts of weapons – swords, axes, spears, and even thunderbolts!  They looked scary!

Khara followed his army, roaring like a stormy cloud. He wanted to kill Rama so badly! He urged his charioteer to go faster and faster.  They were ready for a big fight!
