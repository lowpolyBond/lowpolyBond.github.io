Ravana was a very bad guy.  After a mean thing happened, he flew around in his chariot. He saw King Marutta doing a special ceremony with the gods.

The gods were scared of Ravana. To hide, they turned into animals! Indra became a peacock, Dharmaraja a crow, Kuvera a chameleon, and Varuna a swan.  The other gods hid too.

Ravana went to the ceremony. He was rude and bossy.  He told King Marutta, "Fight me, or give up!"

King Marutta asked, "Who are you?"

Ravana laughed. "I'm Ravana! I'm so strong, nobody knows me?" He bragged about beating his brother.

King Marutta said, "You may be strong, but it's wrong to brag about hurting your brother!  I'll fight you!"

But a wise man stopped him. He said, "Don't fight!  If you stop the ceremony, bad things will happen."  King Marutta listened and finished the ceremony.

Ravana thought he won. He even ate some of the wise people there!  Then he flew away.

The gods changed back into themselves.  Indra gave the peacock beautiful colours and said it would never be afraid of snakes.  He said its beautiful tail would show when it rained.

Dharmaraja gave the crow a special gift – it wouldn’t get sick easily and would live a long time.

Varuna gave the swan beautiful white feathers.

Kuvera gave the chameleon a shiny golden head.

The gods went home, happy their ceremony was finished, even though Ravana was mean.
