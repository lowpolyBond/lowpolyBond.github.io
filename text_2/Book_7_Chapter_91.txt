King Kakutstha told his brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, "We're going to have a HUGE party! It's called an Ashvamedha sacrifice."

He told Lakshmana, "Go get all the wise people – the Brahmins – and tell them to come.  We need them to help."

Lakshmana, who was super fast, ran and got all the wise people.  They bowed to Rama, who was very handsome and kind. They were happy to help.

Rama explained what the Ashvamedha sacrifice was all about.  Everyone agreed it was a very important and good thing to do.

King Kakutstha was pleased. He told Lakshmana, "Tell Sugriva and his monkey friends to come to the party!  And tell Bibishana and his Rakshasa friends to come too! Let's invite everyone!"

He added, "We need to invite ALL the kings, and all the wise people from faraway lands.  We need musicians, dancers, and jugglers too! Let's have a big celebration by the Gaumati River. We need lots of food – rice, beans, chickpeas, oil, and spices!  We need lots of gold and silver too! We need to build lots of tents for everyone!"

He told Lakshmana, "Tell Bharata to bring all the gold and silver.  Let the cooks, dancers, and merchants come too!  Everyone should have lots of food, drinks, and nice clothes!"


Bharata, Shatrughna, Sugriva and his monkeys, Bibishana and his Rakshasas, and many, many others all went to the party. It was going to be the best party ever!
