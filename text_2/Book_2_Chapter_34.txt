Once upon a time, there was a handsome prince named Rama. He was kind and strong, like a lion.  Rama told his friend Sumantra to tell his father, the King, that he was ready to leave.

Sumantra went to see the King.  The King was very, very sad. He looked as sad as a fire without flames. Sumantra bowed and said, “Your son, Rama, is here! He gave all his money to poor people and said goodbye to his friends. He’s ready to go to the forest.”

The King, who was very wise and good, said, "Sumantra, please ask all the queens to come. I want to see Rama with them."

Many queens came. They were all crying because Rama was leaving. The King then asked Sumantra to bring Rama, his brother Lakshmana, and his wife Sita.

When Rama came, the King was so happy to see him!  He stood up to hug Rama, but he was so sad that he fainted! Rama and Lakshmana quickly helped him.  The whole palace was filled with crying women.  They all shouted, "Rama! Rama!"

Rama told his father, "I'm going to the forest for fourteen years. Lakshmana and Sita are coming with me. Please don't be sad."

The King said, "Rama, my dear son, Queen Kaikeyi tricked me!  You should take the kingdom, but I know you’ll do what is right."

Rama said, "Father, I will go to the forest.  I will be true to my word.  Please let my brother Bharata rule the kingdom instead."

The King was heartbroken. He hugged Rama and fainted again!  Everyone was crying, except Queen Kaikeyi. Even Sumantra fainted from sadness.  The whole palace was filled with sadness.  But Rama, brave and kind, was ready for his journey to the forest.
