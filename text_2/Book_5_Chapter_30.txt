Hanuman, the brave monkey, saw Sita.  She was beautiful, like a princess from a magical garden.  Hanuman had a lot to think about!

He found Sita!  Millions of monkeys were looking for her, but *he* found her.  He was a secret spy, learning about Ravana's army. He knew Ravana was strong, but he needed to help Sita. Sita was very sad because she missed her husband, Rama.  Hanuman wanted to comfort her.

But it was tricky!  If he talked to Sita in front of Ravana's guards, they would catch him.  If he didn't talk to her, Sita might give up and die. If he went back to Rama without talking to Sita, Rama would be very angry.  Hanuman worried about all the dangers! What if he scared Sita by looking like a monkey? What if the guards caught him and hurt Sita?  What if he couldn't get back across the ocean?

Hanuman thought hard.  Then he had an idea! He would talk about Rama. Sita loved Rama very much. If Hanuman talked about Rama, Sita wouldn't be scared.

So Hanuman spoke to Sita in a soft voice. He said Rama's name, and told Sita how good and brave Rama was.  He used kind words, and Sita listened.  Hanuman was ready to do anything to help Sita.
