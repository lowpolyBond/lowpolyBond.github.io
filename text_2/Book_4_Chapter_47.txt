Once upon a time, a brave monkey king named Sugriva wanted to find Sita, a princess who was missing.  He asked his monkey friends to help.

Lots of monkeys went searching!  They looked everywhere: in lakes, rivers, fields, and even cities.  They climbed mountains and walked through thick forests.  They searched all day long.  When night came, they slept under trees filled with yummy fruit.

A whole month went by! The monkeys were sad. They didnâ€™t find Sita.  One by one, they came back to Sugriva.  Vinata searched the east, Shatabali searched the north, and Sushena searched the west.  None of them found Sita.

Finally, Sushena came to Sugriva and Rama. He bowed down and said, "We looked everywhere, my king! We searched mountains, forests, and even the seashore. We fought scary animals! But we couldn't find Sita."

Then Sushena said something important: "Only Hanuman, the strong and brave son of the wind god, can find Sita. He's already gone to look for her!"
