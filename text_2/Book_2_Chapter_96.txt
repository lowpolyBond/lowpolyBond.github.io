Rama and Sita were enjoying a nice meal by the river.  Rama gave Sita some delicious roasted meat.  Suddenly, they saw a big cloud of dust!

"Lakshmana!" Rama called. "What's that?"

The dust was from a huge army marching towards them!  Elephants, horses, and soldiers were all running around in a big mess.  Even the birds were scared!

Lakshmana quickly climbed a tall tree to see. "It's a huge army!" he shouted down.  "Lots of elephants, horses, and soldiers!"

"Who are they?" Rama asked.

Lakshmana looked closer.  "It's Bharata's army!" he yelled. "He's probably here to fight us and take the kingdom!"  Lakshmana was very angry. He wanted to fight right away!

"Wait," Rama said. "Let's find out for sure."

Lakshmana saw a big white flag on one of the chariots.  It had a pomegranate on it.  That was Bharata's flag!

Lakshmana was furious.  "Bharata wants to hurt you, Rama!  He wants the kingdom for himself! I'll kill him! I'll kill Kaikeyi and Manthara too!  I'll win the war!"  He was so angry, he wanted to fight immediately!  He wanted to make sure Bharata and his army would never hurt Rama and Sita again.
