Prince Rama rode in his chariot.  He saw his happy friends! The city was bright white, like a fluffy cloud.  Flags waved everywhere.  It smelled wonderful, like sweet incense. Lots and lots of people were there.  There were tall, beautiful buildings.

Rama drove down the streets.  They smelled amazing! There were piles of sandalwood burning.  He saw pretty silks and wool. There were shiny pearls and sparkly jewels!  There were food stalls and shops selling everything.  The streets were decorated beautifully, like a magical path in heaven! People put out yummy things like milk, rice, and sweet treats.

People cheered, "Prince Rama! Rule like your grandpa and great-grandpa! We'll be happy, just like in the good old days!"  They loved him so much!  They just wanted Rama to be king.

Everyone watched Rama.  If they *didn't* see him, they felt sad. Rama was kind to everyone, rich and poor, young and old.  Everyone loved him.

Rama passed pretty temples and gardens. He bowed respectfully. Then he saw the palace! It was huge and white, like a cloud! The towers were tall and pointy, like snowy mountains.  It was even more beautiful than any other palace in the world!

Rama got out of his chariot. He walked through three big gates guarded by strong archers. Then he went through more gates and left his friends behind. He went to see his father, the king.

Everyone waited. They were so excited to see Rama become king! They waited like the ocean waits for the bright full moon!
