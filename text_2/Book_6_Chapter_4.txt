Rama and his friends were ready to rescue Sita!  Hanuman, the brave monkey, had just told Rama all about Lanka, the scary island where the evil Ravana kept Sita.

Rama said, "We'll go to Lanka and defeat Ravana!  Sugriva, let's leave now! The sun is high, and it's a good time to start."  Rama felt very sure he would win. He even said his eyelid was twitching, a sign of good luck!

Rama gave clever orders for his monkey army.  "Nila," he said, "lead a big group ahead to check the path. Make sure it's safe.  Ravana's demons might try to make the path dangerous by destroying food and water."

Rama picked strong monkey leaders.  Gaja, Gavaya, and Gavaksha were strong like bulls. Rishabha was a great jumper, and Gandhamadana was strong like an elephant.  Hanuman would carry Rama, and Angada would carry Lakshmana. Jambavan and his bear friends would protect the back of the army.

Sugriva gave the orders, and the monkeys were so excited!  They leaped and shouted, swinging from trees, showing off how strong they were. "We will defeat Ravana!" they roared.

Rishabha, Nila, and Kumuda cleared the path for the army.  Rama, Lakshmana, and Sugriva were in the middle, surrounded by many brave monkeys.  Shatabali was so strong, he could protect the whole army by himself!

Lakshmana looked up at the sky. "Brother," he said, "everything looks good! The wind is blowing in our favor, the birds are singing, and the stars are shining brightly.  We will win!"

The monkey army marched south, raising so much dust that the sun was hidden! They crossed rivers and mountains, ate tasty fruits, and played along the way.  They were so happy to help Rama save Sita!

They finally reached the sea.  Rama said, "Sugriva, we've reached the ocean. It's too big to cross easily. Let's rest and think of a plan."

The monkeys set up camp.  They looked out at the huge ocean. It was full of scary sharks and waves that crashed loudly.  The ocean looked so big and wild! They knew it would be a big challenge to cross it, but they were determined to help Rama rescue Sita.
