Hanuman and the monkey army were fighting a big, scary battle.  Rama heard all the loud noises.  He told Jambavan, the wise bear king, "Jambavan, it sounds like Hanuman is in trouble! Go help him and his army!"

Jambavan and his bear soldiers rushed to the battle.  But they saw Hanuman coming back, sad and alone.  The other monkeys had given up. Hanuman stopped the bears.  He was very upset. He told Rama, "Indrajit, Ravana's son, killed Sita! She was crying, and I couldn't stop him."

Rama was so heartbroken he fell to the ground.  All the monkey leaders ran to help him. They poured cool, flower-scented water on him.

Lakshmana, Rama's brother, held him close.  Lakshmana was worried. He said, "Rama, good things don't always happen to good people.  It seems like being good doesn't always protect you.  Maybe being strong is more important than being good." Lakshmana also said,  "Maybe what's really important is being brave and protecting what you love."

Lakshmana was angry about Sita. He wanted to fight Ravana. He told Rama, "Rama, you are strong and brave! You are the best! I will defeat Indrajit and Ravana!"

Rama stood up, ready to fight.  He knew he had to save Sita.
