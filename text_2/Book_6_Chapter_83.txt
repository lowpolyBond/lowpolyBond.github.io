In battle's tumult, fierce and grand,
Between demons and monkeys' band,
Rama to Jambavan did say,
"O excellent one! Make no delay!

The rattling arms, a dreadful sound,
By Hanuman, in feat renowned,
I'm sure, O lord of bears so bold,
Go help him now, let's not withhold."

Jambavan, with his forces strong,
Responded to Rama's call, ere long.
To the western gate, they made their way,
Where Hanuman in the midst did sway.

Jambavan beheld Hanuman's might,
Leading monkeys in the perilous fight,
But when he saw the bear brigade,
Like a dark cloud, they were arrayed.

Hanuman, in retreat, did sway,
Seeing the bears come to join the fray,
Then to Rama, with sorrow, he spoke,
Of Sita's fate, his heart did choke.

"While we fought, Indrajit, so vile,
Killed Sita, caused our hearts to pile,
With grief and sadness, O Rama dear,
I bring this news, let it be clear."

Rama, upon hearing this woeful tale,
Fell to the ground, like a tree frail,
Monkeys gathered around in haste,
With water and scents, his strength to taste.

Lakshmana, in sorrow, took Rama's side,
His ailing brother, he did chide,
"Virtue can't shield from life's cruel blows,
In this world where fortune ebbs and flows.

Righteousness, it seems, is but a sham,
For Ravana's deeds bring no damnation's slam,
While you, in virtue, have faced such plight,
The fruits of both seem out of sight.

If virtue's path were truly sure,
No evil could your heart endure,
So, it seems, in this fateful dance,
Virtue and vice switch roles by chance.

If unrighteousness can thrive and bloom,
While virtue's path leads to your doom,
Then virtue, I fear, is but a shade,
In the realm where destinies are laid.

Or, perhaps, it's not about the act,
But the rituals prescribed, in fact,
For if one kills by sacred rite,
It's the ritual's fruit, not the doer's plight.

O Rama, virtue's path is unclear,
In times of joy or times of fear,
It may not be real, as it seems,
But I speak this to calm your dreams.

If virtue's weak, surrendering to might,
Then, perhaps, it's time to see the light,
Let virtue play a lesser role,
And might befriend your noble soul.

Remember, truth has its own cost,
Our father's lies, though they were lost,
Yet, you accepted his royal decree,
Is truth the path it claims to be?

Even Indra, lord of heavens high,
Performed a sacrifice, don't deny,
Killing a sage, a sinful act,
Yet, his throne remained intact.

O Rama, virtue's power, it's true,
Is mighty when combined with strength's hue,
So, let's embrace both, side by side,
In this world where fate and fortune ride.

Virtue's roots, you may have clipped away,
With your recent choice, come what may,
But wealth, my brother, has its worth,
It brings joy, it's not a curse from birth.

Prosperity and kin, they stand by gold,
In riches, a man's story is told,
A virtuous soul, when wealth is near,
Faces no trouble, has naught to fear.

But the penniless, seeking wealth in vain,
Turn to sinful deeds, bear life's pain,
Friendship and kin, they fade from sight,
Only wealth makes a man's life bright.

O king, from riches, all blessings flow,
Delight, pride, control, and woe,
Wealth gives power, and wisdom's grace,
A life of comfort, in wealth's embrace.

Sita, your beloved, was stolen away,
In your exile, a demon's prey,
Today, through my might, we shall restore,
What Indrajit stole, we'll settle the score.

So, rise, O Rama, the strong and wise,
Let not sorrow cloud your eyes,
With discipline and soul so great,
Together, we'll rewrite our fate.

Let not wealth or virtue confound,
For both have their limits, I expound,
In this world of change and strife,
We'll find the balance for a better life."
