Long ago, a king named Bhagiratha wanted to help his ancestors.  His great-great-grandfather, King Sagara, had sixty thousand sons!  They had been turned to ash a long time ago, and nobody could give them a proper goodbye.

Bhagiratha prayed and prayed.  He asked the magical river Ganga to come down from the sky and wash away the ashes.  The river listened!  It flowed down, and washed over the ashes.

Suddenly, a magical being named Brahma appeared! He said, "King Bhagiratha, you did it! Your ancestors are now in heaven. The Ganga will always be remembered because of you.  It will even be called the Bhagirathi river!"

Brahma told Bhagiratha to do the special goodbye ceremonies for his ancestors.  He said, "You're a great king!  You've done something nobody else could!" Then Brahma went back to the sky.

Bhagiratha did the ceremonies. He was so happy! He went back to his kingdom, and everyone was joyful to have him back.  They were all happy and safe.

This is the story of how the Ganga river came to Earth, Rama. It's a very special story.  If you listen carefully, it will bring you good luck, happiness, and a long life. And if you tell it to others, it will help them too!  Now, it's time for evening prayers.
