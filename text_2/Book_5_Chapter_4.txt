Super-strong Hanuman, the best monkey ever, went to Lanka, a sparkly city that could change its shape!  He jumped right over the big wall, sneaking in at night.  He was there to help King Rama.

Hanuman walked down the pretty streets.  Flowers were everywhere!  He could hear music and people laughing.  The city was full of amazing houses with shiny diamond windows â€“ they looked like a sky full of clouds!

He saw all kinds of people: women singing beautiful songs, guards with swords and clubs, and even some really strange-looking spies!  Some were tiny, some were huge, some had only one eye!  There were so many soldiers guarding the king's palace.

Hanuman saw lots of cool weapons too: swords, spears, bows and arrows! Some soldiers were all dressed up in fancy clothes and jewels.  Others were plain.  He saw lots and lots of elephants too, big as clouds!


Finally, Hanuman reached the King Ravana's palace. It was HUGE, made of gold, with sparkling gems everywhere! It smelled amazing, like sweet perfume.  Hanuman had found his way inside!  He was ready for his next mission to find Sita, Rama's wife!
