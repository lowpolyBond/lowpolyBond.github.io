Rama, a strong and brave prince, arrived at Lanka with loud trumpets and drums.  Ravana, the powerful king of Lanka, heard the noise. He paused, then spoke to his advisors.

Ravana boomed, "I've heard about this Rama!  They say he's very brave, and he even crossed the ocean! But you all are quiet now!  Why aren't you scared?"

Malyavan, a wise advisor, answered Ravana. "King," he said, "a good king knows when to fight and when to make peace. Rama is very strong, and even the gods want him to win.  We should give Sita back to him. That's the reason for this fight."

Malyavan explained, "There are two paths: a good path and a bad path.  Ravana, you have chosen the bad path.  You've been hurting people and being mean. Now, bad things are happening to you."

Malyavan described scary signs:  dark clouds, animals crying, and strange things happening in the city.  "These are warnings!" he said.  "Rama is very powerful, maybe even a god in disguise!  He built a bridge across the ocean!  Make peace with him, King Ravana, it's the best thing for you!"

After Malyavan finished speaking, he looked at Ravana, knowing what Ravana was thinking, and was silent.
