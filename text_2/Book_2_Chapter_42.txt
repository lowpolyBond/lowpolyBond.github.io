King Dasaratha loved his son Rama very much.  He watched Rama's chariot go away.  He kept watching until he could no longer see the dust from the chariot's wheels.  Then, he was so sad he fell to the ground!

Queen Kaushalya and Queen Kaikeyi helped him up.  King Dasaratha was very angry with Queen Kaikeyi.  She had sent Rama away. He said, "You are not my wife anymore!  You sent my son away!"

Queen Kaushalya helped the king into his chariot. He was so sad! He felt like he had hurt someone very badly. He missed Rama terribly.  He thought about Rama sleeping on the hard ground instead of his soft bed. He imagined Sita, Rama's wife, walking in the forest, her feet hurting.

"Kaikeyi," he cried, "you got what you wanted! Now you rule, but I can't live without my son!"

The king went back to the city.  It was quiet and empty. Everyone was sad because Rama was gone.  The king felt like the sun hiding behind a cloud.

The king was heartbroken. He wanted to see Queen Kaushalya, Rama's mother.  He went to her room.  But even there, he was sad.  The palace felt empty without Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita. It was like the sky without the moon.

That night, King Dasaratha couldn't sleep. He said to Queen Kaushalya, "I can only see Rama.  Please touch me, my queen."  They both cried, missing Rama very much.
