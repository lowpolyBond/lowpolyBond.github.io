Once upon a time, Sita was very sad.  A mean king named Ravana had captured her.  But a kind giantess named Sarama came to help. Sarama was super fast and could fly really high, even faster than the wind!

Sita asked Sarama to secretly fly to Rama, Sita's husband, and bring back news.  Sarama said, "I can fly anywhere! I'll find out what Ravana is planning and come right back!"

Sarama flew to Ravana's palace and secretly listened.  Ravana was talking to his friends.  Some of them wanted to let Sita go.  Ravana's own mother even asked him to! She said, "Rama is so strong! He's amazing! Let Sita go home."

But Ravana was greedy. He was like a person who wouldn't let go of their favorite toy! He wouldn't let Sita go until he was defeated in a battle.

Sarama flew back to Sita and told her everything.  "Ravana won't let you go unless Rama defeats him in a big fight!" she said.

Just then, BOOM!  Sita and Sarama heard a huge noise.  It was Rama's army!  The monkeys were coming to rescue Sita!  The sound made Ravana's army very scared. They knew they might lose!
