Once upon a time, a very sad Sita was talking to a powerful monkey named Hanuman. Hanuman was Rama's messenger.  He said, "Dear Sita, Rama sent me! He's safe and he wants to know if you're okay.  Lakshmana, Rama's best friend, misses you very much too!"

Sita was so happy to hear this news! She talked with Hanuman for a long time.  But then, she started to worry.  She thought, "Maybe this monkey is Ravana in disguise!  Ravana is very sneaky!"  Sita felt scared and fell to the ground.

Hanuman bowed down to Sita.  Sita was still afraid and whispered, "If you're Ravana pretending to be someone else, that's very bad! You tricked me before!"

Hanuman said, "I'm not Ravana! I'm Hanuman, Rama's friend's helper. I swam across the ocean to get here! Rama is brave and kind.  He was tricked by Ravana into letting you be taken away. He's very sad and wants to rescue you.  Lakshmana and Sugriva, Rama's monkey friend, also send their love."

Hanuman told Sita all about Rama's strength and goodness. He told her Rama was going to defeat Ravana.  He explained how he, Hanuman, had even visited Ravana's city!

Sita finally believed him. She was so relieved to hear such good news! She knew that soon, she would see Rama again.
