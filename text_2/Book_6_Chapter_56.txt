Note from Griffith:

In Canto LVI Akampan sees that the Rákshases are worsted, and fights with
redoubled rage and vigour. The Vánars fall fast under his “nets of
arrows.” Hanumán comes to the rescue. He throws mountain peaks at the
giant which are dexterously stopped with flights of arrows; and at last
beats him down and kills him with a tree.
