Akampana, a powerful titan, saw the monkey warriors fighting bravely.  He was very angry!  He yelled at his driver, "Go, go fast! Those monkeys are winning! They’re using trees and rocks as weapons! I'll stop them!"

Akampana zoomed toward the battle in his chariot. He threw lots of sharp darts at the monkeys.  The monkeys were confused and couldn't fight back.

Hanuman, the strongest monkey, saw his friends hurt. He rushed to help!  Other brave monkeys joined him.  They felt strong with Hanuman leading them.

Akampana was like a giant! He rained arrows down on Hanuman. But Hanuman stood strong as a rock! He laughed, jumped, and roared, shaking the ground! He was too strong to look at, like a big fire.

Hanuman ran out of weapons.  He grabbed a HUGE rock and threw it at Akampana! Akampana broke the rock with his darts.

Hanuman was even angrier! He pulled up a giant tree – as big as a mountain! He swung it around and smashed through everything – trees, elephants, chariots, and soldiers!

The titans were scared!  They ran away! Akampana, though, fought back. He shot many arrows into Hanuman.  Hanuman looked like a tree covered in leaves, but he was still strong!

He pulled up another tree!  He hit Akampana so hard that Akampana fell down, dead.

All the titans ran back to their city, Lanka, very scared! They dropped their weapons and bumped into each other as they ran.

The monkeys cheered for Hanuman! They all praised him for being so brave. Hanuman was as famous as the great god Vishnu! Even Rama, Lakshmana, Sugriva, and Vibhishana were very proud of him.
