Guha saw Bharata's HUGE army by the river.  He was worried!  "My friends!" he said, "That's a scary army! Bharata is here for trouble. Maybe he wants to hurt me, or even worse, hurt Rama!" Rama was kind and good, but he was exiled – sent away from his home.

Guha loved Rama. "We need to protect him!" he shouted. "Get your armor! Guard the riverbanks!  Put guards on five hundred boats!  Keep watch!"  He wanted to make sure Rama was safe.

Guha brought gifts of fish, meat, and honey to meet Bharata. Sumantra, Bharata's wise advisor, saw Guha coming. "That's Guha!" he said. "He's the river king. He knows this land and he's Rama's friend. Let's talk to him!"

Bharata said, "Yes, invite Guha to meet me."

Guha went to Bharata. "This land is yours," Guha said. "I'm sorry I don't have a better welcome.  Please, stay at my home tonight! I have food for your army – fruits, roots, and meat. Tomorrow you can travel on."  Guha was being very kind and helpful.
