Once upon a time, there was a very good man named Vishravas. He was a wise man who loved to pray and study.  He married a beautiful woman, and they had a baby boy!

Everyone was so happy. Vishravas’s father, Paulastya, loved his grandson very much. He thought, "My grandson should be called Vaishravana, because he looks just like his father!"

Vaishravana grew up to be a kind and strong young man. He loved to pray and spend time alone in the forest.  He prayed for a thousand years! He didn't even eat much. He just drank water and breathed.

One day, the great god Brahma came to see Vaishravana. Brahma was so impressed! He said, "You have been so good and kind. I will grant you a wish!"

Vaishravana said, "I want to help protect the world!"

Brahma smiled. "You shall be one of the four Guardians of the World!" he said.  He gave Vaishravana a magical flying chariot called Pushpaka, as shiny as the sun!

But Vaishravana needed a home.  His father said, "There's a beautiful empty city on a mountain called Lanka. It's by the ocean.  It was made for some scary monsters, but they’re all gone now."

So, Vaishravana went to Lanka. He became the King of Lanka!  He ruled kindly, and everyone was happy.  He often visited his parents in his magical flying chariot, with beautiful dancers and singers. He was the Lord of Wealth, a protector of the world, and a very good king!
