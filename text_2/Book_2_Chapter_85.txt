Prince Bharata met Guha, a ferryman.  Bharata explained, "My brother Rama is in the forest. I'm going to bring him home."

Guha was worried.  He asked, "Are you going to hurt him?"

Bharata said, "Never! Rama is like my father to me. I love him very much!"

Guha was happy. He said, "You are a good prince! You're leaving your kingdom to get Rama. Everyone will remember you for this!"

Guha's men helped Bharata cross the river.  As the sun went down, Bharata rested in his tent.

But Bharata was very sad.  He missed Rama terribly. He felt so much sorrow, it was like a burning fire inside him. He cried and worried all night.

Guha and his friends came to comfort Bharata. They told him to be brave and that he would soon see Rama again.
