Rama was very, very sad.  His wife, Sita, was missing!  He looked at Lakshmana, his brother, and said, "Lakshmana, please go to the Godaveri River. Maybe Sita went there to pick flowers."

Lakshmana hurried to the river. He looked everywhere, but he couldn't find Sita.  He called her name, but no one answered.  He went back to Rama and said, "I couldn't find her, Rama. Where could she be?"

Rama was heartbroken. He ran to the river and shouted, "Sita! Where are you?"  But the river and the forest animals wouldn't tell him what happened. They were too scared of the bad guy, Ravana, who had taken Sita.

Rama was losing hope.  He said to Lakshmana, "The river won't help us. What will I say to Sita's parents? They'll be so angry!"  He remembered how Sita had helped him when he lived in the forest.  He missed her terribly.

Rama looked at some deer. They seemed to be trying to tell him something. He asked them, "Where is Sita?" The deer looked south and cried out.

Lakshmana understood!  "Brother," he said, "the deer are pointing south! Let's go that way!"

They followed the deer.  Rama saw some flowers on the ground. "These are Sita's flowers!" he cried.  He gave them to her before.

Rama talked to a big mountain. "Mountain," he shouted, "did you see Sita?" The mountain was too afraid of Ravana to answer.  Rama got angry. "If you don't tell me, I will destroy you!" he roared.

Then, Rama saw something shocking: footprints!  Sita's footprints and the footprints of a giant! There were also broken things – a bow, arrows, and even parts of a chariot. There was blood on the ground too.

Rama realized what happened.  A giant, Ravana, had taken Sita!  Rama was furious. He saw Sita’s jewelry scattered all around. He was so angry that he wanted to destroy everything – the mountains, the rivers, even the whole world!  He wanted to find Sita, no matter what! He picked up his bow and arrow, ready to fight the giant. He vowed to find Sita and get revenge for what happened.
