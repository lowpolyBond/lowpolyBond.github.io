In the battlefield fierce, both valiant and bold,
Stood Vibhishaṇ, watching the story unfold.
Lakshmana and Indrajit, in combat they sway,
Like rutting elephants, in the heat of the day.

Vibhishaṇ, his bow in his hand held so high,
Released sharpened arrows, towards the sky they did fly.
Demons they tore, like thunderbolts' strike,
As mountains they cleaved, in that deadly hike.

Surrounded by demons, like tuskers they stand,
Monkeys in the fray, a determined band.
Vibhishaṇ inspired, with words of the wise,
"Together we'll conquer, let victory arise.

Prahasta is fallen, Nikumbha as well,
Kumbhakarna, Dhumraksha, in battle they fell.
Jambumali, Mahamali, all met their doom,
Ravana's proud forces now face certain gloom.

Now face this lone demon, Ravana's last hope,
With him gone, we'll sever the evil's tight rope.
Why stand idle, let action begin,
Destroy this dark force, let the light come in."

The monkeys rejoiced, their tails they did lash,
In Vibhishaṇ's words, they found renewed flash.
With roars of triumph, like peacocks they cried,
As the demons they fought, side by side.

Jambavan, the mighty, tore trees from their roots,
With strength and with fury, he crushed the brute.
The demons surrounded, their weapons in hand,
Struck at Jambavan, on the bloodied sand.

Indrajit, undaunted, his aim to fulfil,
With arrows like serpents, launched at his will.
Lakshmana, his target, arrows did dodge,
As they fought in the dark, a relentless deluge.

The sky turned to night, with arrows ablaze,
A deadly exchange, in a darkened haze.
Their hands moved so swiftly, their bows a blur,
In this fierce confrontation, no defeat would occur.

A network of arrows, covered the sky,
As Lakshmana and Indrajit, let their arrows fly.
Light as a feather, their hands never stilled,
In this battle of heroes, their destinies fulfilled.

Surrounded by darkness, as day turned to night,
Their arrows in flight, a deadly, swift fight.
The earth trembled under the weight of their might,
As they battled on, in the pale moonlight.

But Vibhishaṇ watched, wise and aware,
For Lakshmana's weariness, he had a care.
He joined in the combat, his bow held high,
To aid in the battle, as the stars filled the sky.
