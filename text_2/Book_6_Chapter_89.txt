Rama's brave brother, Lakshmana, was fighting Indrajit, a powerful demon.  Lakshmana shot many arrows.  The arrows flew so fast!  Indrajit looked scared.

Bibishana, a good demon who helped Rama, saw Indrajit's fear. He told Lakshmana, "Indrajit is about to lose! Hurry!"

Lakshmana shot more arrows. They were sharp like snakes! Indrajit was dizzy.  But Indrajit was strong! He jumped up, his eyes angry.

Indrajit yelled, "You and your brother were beaten before!  Remember? You can't win!" He shot seven arrows at Lakshmana and ten at Hanuman, another monkey friend.  He shot one hundred arrows at Bibishana.

Lakshmana just laughed.  "That's all you've got?" he said.  He shot many more arrows!  Indrajit's shiny golden armor broke into pieces!

Indrajit fought back hard. He shot a thousand arrows, and Lakshmana's armor broke too!  They fought and fought!  Arrows flew everywhere! Blood poured from their cuts.

They kept fighting and fighting for a long, long time.  They were very, very tired.  It was like a big storm of arrows!  They looked like trees covered in flowers, but the flowers were arrows!

Bibishana helped Lakshmana, giving him a break to rest. The two brave warriors fought a mighty battle, but their fight is a story for another day!
