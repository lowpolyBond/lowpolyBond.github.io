Once upon a time, in a faraway kingdom, lived a wicked woman named Manthara.  She was jealous of Prince Rama, the kind and brave older brother of Prince Bharata.  When Queen Kaikeyi was very happy about Rama becoming king, Manthara whispered nasty things.

"Don't be fooled!" she hissed. "Rama will be king, but then Bharata, your son, will be left with nothing!  He'll be sad and alone.  Rama is clever and might even hurt Bharata!"

Manthara lied a lot. She said that Rama would be mean to Bharata.  She said that Bharata would be a servant to Rama's mother, Queen Kaushalya.  She even said that Bharata might die!

Queen Kaikeyi loved Rama and thought he was wonderful. "Rama is good and kind," she said. "He deserves to be king, and he'll always protect Bharata."

But Manthara kept whispering, making Queen Kaikeyi afraid.  She said Rama would become king and get rid of Bharata.  She planted bad thoughts in the queen's heart.  She said Bharata needed to be protected, and the only way was to make sure Rama didn't become king.

Manthara tricked the queen into asking the king for two wishes. One was that Rama be sent far away to the forest, and the other was that Bharata, her son, become king.  Poor Queen Kaikeyi believed Manthara's lies. She made a terrible decision because of Manthara's wicked words.  And that's how Rama, the good prince, went to live in the forest.
