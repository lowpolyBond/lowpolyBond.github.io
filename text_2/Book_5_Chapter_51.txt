Once upon a time, a brave monkey named Hanuman met the scary, ten-headed king Ravana.  Hanuman wasn't afraid! He had a message from his king, Sugriva.

"Greetings, Ravana!" Hanuman said. "Sugriva sends his best wishes.  He wants you to know something important.  King Dasaratha, a good and kind king, had a son named Rama. Rama, his wife Sita, and his brother Lakshmana went into the forest.  Sita disappeared!  Rama and Lakshmana are looking for her."

Hanuman explained how Rama helped Sugriva become king of the monkeys.  To do this, Rama fought and defeated a powerful monkey named Bali. Now, Sugriva's monkeys are searching everywhere for Sita.  Hanuman himself had flown across a huge ocean!  He found Sita!

"I saw Sita in your palace!" Hanuman told Ravana. "It's not right to keep someone else's wife.  Rama is very strong and brave.  No one can beat him! Please, give Sita back to Rama. It's the right thing to do."

Hanuman warned Ravana that keeping Sita was very dangerous.  "Rama is like the powerful god Vishnu! Even the strongest gods couldn't defeat him!"

Ravana was angry! He didn't want to give Sita back.  He ordered his guards to kill Hanuman!  But Hanuman was a very brave monkey.  This was just the beginning of a great adventure to rescue Sita!
