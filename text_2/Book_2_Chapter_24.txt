Rama's mother, Queen Kaushalya, was very sad.  Rama had to go live in the forest.  She cried. "Rama, my dear son," she said, "you've never been hungry or cold. How will you live on fruits and roots?  I'll miss you so much!  It's not fair!"

Rama loved his mother. He said, "Mother, I must obey my father, even though it's hard.  Please stay with my father. He needs you."

Queen Kaushalya was still very sad.  "But I want to go with you!" she cried.

Rama explained, "Mother, a wife should always take care of her husband. You must stay with my father. My brother Bharata will also take good care of you."

He promised to come back after fourteen years.  He told her to be kind, to pray, and to take care of his father.  He said, "Mother, please be strong.  I will return."

Queen Kaushalya knew she couldn't stop him. She hugged him tight, her eyes full of tears. "Go, my son," she whispered. "Come back safely."  She gave him a blessing, hoping he'd come home soon.
