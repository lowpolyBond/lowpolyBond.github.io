Once upon a time, a giant bird named Jatayu saw the mean ten-headed king, Ravana, kidnapping a princess named Sita.  Jatayu was brave! He flew up and fought Ravana in the sky.  They were like two huge flying mountains battling!

Ravana threw lots of sharp arrows at Jatayu.  Jatayu was strong and didn't fall.  He scratched Ravana with his sharp claws!  Ravana got angry. He shot more arrows. Jatayu got hurt but he still fought bravely. He broke Ravana's bow!

Ravana got a new bow and shot more arrows. Jatayu was covered in arrows, like a bird in a nest! But he flapped his wings and broke free. He even broke Ravana's shield and knocked down his chariot!

Ravana's chariot crashed! Everyone cheered for Jatayu! But Ravana was still strong.  He was tired and old, so Ravana picked up Sita and flew away.

Jatayu was very hurt, but he still wanted to stop Ravana. He told Ravana, "You are taking the princess who belongs to Prince Rama!  This is very bad!  Rama is powerful and will come for his princess!"

Jatayu attacked Ravana. He pecked and scratched him. Ravana fought back and hurt Jatayu badly.  He cut off Jatayu's wings and legs. Poor Jatayu fell to the ground.

Sita was very sad to see Jatayu hurt.  She hugged the brave bird.  Ravana, even though he won the fight, flew away with Sita, leaving the injured Jatayu behind.  Jatayu was a true hero, even though he lost the battle.
