The brave monkey generals woke up on Mount Suvela.  They looked at Lanka.  Wow!  It was HUGE!  The island was so beautiful!

Everywhere were amazing flowers and trees!  There were Champakas, Ashokas, and so many more kinds of trees – too many to name!  The trees were full of blossoms, and sweet-smelling fruit.  Bees buzzed everywhere.  It smelled wonderful!  The monkeys could change shapes, so they went to explore.  They heard cuckoos singing and saw lots of pretty birds.

Some monkeys went to the city. They were loud and strong!  They stomped the ground, making a big cloud of dust.  The animals – deer, elephants, even bears and lions – were scared and ran away.

Lanka's city was on a giant mountain, Trikuta.  The mountain was so tall, it seemed to touch the sky! The city was huge – ten leagues wide and twenty leagues long!  It had shiny gold and silver walls, and big gates like fluffy white clouds.

The city was amazing! There were beautiful palaces and temples, like a magical place in the sky. There was even a giant building with a thousand pillars!  It was guarded by strong giants. The city was full of parks, flowers, and singing birds. It was like a magical place!

Rama and Lakshmana, with their army, looked at Lanka. It was so big, strong, and full of treasures! They knew it would be a hard place to fight, but they were ready for a challenge!
