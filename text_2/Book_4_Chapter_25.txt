Rama, Lakshmana, and the monkey friends were very sad about Bali's death.  Rama told Sugriva, Tara, and Angada, "Don't cry so much!  It's important to do what needs to be done now.  We all must accept that death happens. Time moves on, and we must too."

Lakshmana told Sugriva and Angada to prepare for Bali's funeral.  "Gather lots of wood and sandalwood," he said. "Angada, get flowers, beautiful clothes, and other things we need. Tara, find a beautiful palanquin—a fancy carrying chair—to take Bali to his final resting place."

Tara quickly found a gorgeous palanquin! It was like a tiny palace, all decorated and shining.  Rama and Lakshmana helped Sugriva and Angada carefully place Bali inside.

The monkey leaders carried the palanquin, throwing jewels everywhere as they went.  Everyone showed Bali great honor.  His wives followed, crying, "Our hero! Our hero!"  Tara cried the most.

They reached a sandy place near a river. The monkeys built a big fire. Tara held Bali’s head and cried, "My dear one, why don't you look at us? You even smile in death!  Rama's arrow took you away.  We're all so sad!"

Then, with heavy hearts, Angada and Sugriva set Bali’s body on the fire. Rama and Lakshmana helped with the funeral too. They all performed the special rituals.  Afterward, everyone was very, very sad, but they knew they had honored Bali properly.
