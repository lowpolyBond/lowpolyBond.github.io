Rama looked at his brother Lakshmana. Lakshmana was very angry with their stepmother, Kaikeyi. He was breathing hard, like a big elephant!

Rama spoke kindly to Lakshmana.  "Brother," he said, "don't be angry. Be patient. Forget about the coronation. We're going to the forest!"

Rama explained, "Mother Kaikeyi is worried. She thinks you'll force me to become king.  I don't want to upset her, or our father.  If I don't go to the forest, it will make our father very sad.  So, I'm choosing to go."

"If I leave for the forest," Rama continued, "Kaikeyi will be happy. She'll give the kingdom to her son, Bharata. She wants me to go, so I will. Becoming king wasn't meant to be for me. This is what's supposed to happen."

Rama said, "It's all because of fate. Even the wisest people can't always understand why things happen.  Good things and bad things, happy times and sad times – they're all part of life."

"Let's use this water," Rama said, pointing to the water meant for his coronation, "for a different kind of ceremony – a ceremony to start our life in the forest. From now on, we'll do everything ourselves."

"Don't be sad, Lakshmana," Rama said.  "Being king and living in the forest – it's not really that different. And don't blame Kaikeyi. Fate made her say those things."  

Then Rama and Lakshmana prepared to leave for the forest.
