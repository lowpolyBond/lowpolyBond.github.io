King Bali, the strongest monkey king, was hurt really badly!  A sharp arrow from Rama hit him.  Big rocks and trees fell on him too. He was so hurt he passed out.

Bali's wife, Tara, heard the sad news. She rushed out of her cave with her son, Angada.  But when the other monkeys saw Rama with his bow, they ran away scared!

Tara was very upset, but she stopped the monkeys.  "You're Bali's friends!" she shouted.  "Don't run!  Rama shot one arrow, and Bali is hurt, but you must be brave!  Bali's brother hurt him a long time ago, and now he has to rest."

The monkeys said, "Bali is gone! We need a new king. Angada should be king, or weâ€™ll go hide!"

Tara was heartbroken. "My son and the kingdom mean nothing if Bali dies!" she cried. "I need to go to the great hero who hurt my husband."

Tara rushed to Bali. She saw her brave husband, hurt so bad.  He was like a great mountain brought down, or like a ruined temple! Rama, his brother, and Sugriva were nearby. Tara fell to the ground, crying.

Her sad cries made Sugriva and Angada feel very sorry for her.
