Sita, a princess, was held captive by the mean giant Ravana.  Some of Ravana's mean friends heard Sita say she hoped her husband, Rama, would come and save her. They ran to tell Ravana.

These mean giants were scary! They shouted at Sita, "We will eat you!"  But Sita didn't give up hope.

An older, wiser giant woman, Trijata, stopped them.  "Don't hurt Sita!" she said. "Last night, I had a scary dream! I saw Rama coming to rescue her!"

The other giant women were scared too, and they begged Trijata to tell them her dream.

Trijata said, "I saw Rama and his brother Lakshmana in a beautiful chariot pulled by swans!  I saw Sita on a snowy mountain, waiting for Rama. Then, I saw Rama and Lakshmana on a big elephant, going to get Sita!"

She continued, "I saw Rama in a chariot pulled by oxen, coming to save Sita!  Then, I saw the bad giant Ravana falling down, weak and scared!  He looked silly and dirty!"

"I saw Ravana's brothers, Kumbhakarna and Indrajit, looking sad and silly too. But Ravana's good brother Bibishana looked happy and safe. I saw Lanka, Ravana's city, falling apart!"

Trijata finished, "Rama will win! He'll save Sita and defeat all the bad giants! Be nice to Sita! She's going home!"

Sita was happy to hear about this dream.  She smiled and said, "If this dream comes true, I'll protect you all!"
