Once upon a time, a powerful wizard named Vishvamitra wanted to help King Trishanku go to heaven while still alive!  That's very hard to do.  He asked other wise people to help with a big magic ceremony.

They were a little scared of Vishvamitra. He was very powerful, and they knew he'd be angry if they refused. So they helped.  They did lots and lots of special rituals.

Vishvamitra tried to call the gods to the ceremony, but they didn't come! He got very, very angry.  He used his magic!  He shouted, "King Trishanku, go to heaven NOW!"  And *whoosh* â€“ Trishanku went up to heaven!

But the other gods in heaven were mad!  They said, "Trishanku doesn't belong here!  He's not supposed to be here!"  They pushed him back down!  Trishanku was scared and yelled, "Help me, Vishvamitra!"

Vishvamitra was furious!  He was so angry that he made his own heaven!  He made new stars and planets! He even made a whole new group of gods!

The real gods and the other wise people were surprised. They went to Vishvamitra and said, "Please, he's not worthy of heaven."

Vishvamitra said, "I promised he'd go to heaven!  My new heaven will stay as long as the old one does.  And Trishanku will stay there, hanging upside down among the stars."

And that's what happened.  Trishanku was stuck hanging upside down in Vishvamitra's new part of the sky, among the stars.  Everyone went home, amazed by Vishvamitra's amazing magic.  And that's the story of how King Trishanku got his own special place in the sky!
