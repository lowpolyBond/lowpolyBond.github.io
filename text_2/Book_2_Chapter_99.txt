Bharata was excited! He showed his brother, Shatrughna, where Rama's home was.  "Let's get Mother and Vasishtha here quickly!" he said, and hurried off.  Sumantra followed Shatrughna, who was also eager to see Rama.

Bharata found a little hut with a leafy roof.  There was wood and flowers nearby, and Rama and Lakshmana had tied special grass and cloth to the trees to mark their path.  He saw lots of dried animal dung – for fuel in the winter!

"This is it!" Bharata told his friends. "This is where Bharadvaja said Rama lived.  The Mandakini River is close by! Look – Lakshmana marked the trees so he could find his way back at night.  Those elephant tracks... and look at the smoke from the holy fire! There he is, Rama, the best person ever!"

Bharata reached the river. "Rama, our wonderful prince, lives here in the forest! I'm so sad! Because of me, he's here, far from everything happy.  I'll beg him to forgive me!"

Bharata saw Rama's hut.  It was cozy, covered with leaves and branches.  Beautiful bows and arrows hung nearby, shining brightly. There were swords and shields, too, and deer skins.  It was safe and strong.

Inside, Bharata saw Rama! He was sitting near a special place, looking like a bright light.  Rama's hair was long and curly, like flames.  He wore simple clothes made of bark and animal skin.  He was with Sita and Lakshmana.

Bharata was so sad and happy to see his brother! Tears filled his eyes.  He wanted to run to Rama, but he was so overcome with emotion he fell down, unable to speak. He could only cry, "My brother! My dear brother!"

Shatrughna cried too and hugged Rama's feet. Rama hugged them both, and cried with them.  Then Sumantra and Guha came, and everyone was so happy to see the brothers together. Even the forest animals were happy!
