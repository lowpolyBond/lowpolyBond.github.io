Sugriva, the monkey king, was very scared!  He saw Rama and Lakshmana, two strong warriors with big swords.  They looked so strong that Sugriva wanted to hide. He jumped around, nervous as a kitten.

Sugriva whispered to his friends, "I think Bali, my mean brother, sent these warriors! They're hiding in our secret place."

Sugriva's friends were scared too. They all scrambled up a mountain, leaping from rock to rock, making the ground shake!  They were so fast, they scared all the deer, cats, and tigers!

Then, Hanuman, a very clever monkey, spoke to Sugriva. "Don't be afraid!" he said. "Bali isn't here!  You're just too worried, my friend. You're usually so smart!"

But Sugriva was still worried. "Those warriors look like gods! They must be Bali's spies!" he said. "Kings have lots of friends, and I don't trust anyone."

Sugriva had a plan. "Hanuman," he said, "go talk to the warriors. Pretend you're a regular monkey. Be nice to them, and find out why they're here.  See if they're telling the truth."

Hanuman, a brave monkey, agreed.  "Yes, my king!" he said.  He was ready to meet Rama and Lakshmana.
