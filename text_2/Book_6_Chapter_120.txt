Rama was very sad.  He heard everyone crying.  He felt their pain. Tears came to his eyes.

Then, wow!  Lots of important gods came to see him!  There was Indra, the king of the gods, and Yama, the god of death.  Brahma, the creator of the world, came too! They all zoomed in on their shiny chariots. They wanted to help Rama.

Indra, the king of the gods, said, "Rama, you're so strong and wise!  Why are you so upset about Sita?  You're not just a normal person! You're a super-powerful god!" He told Rama all about his amazing powers and past lives.

Rama said, "But I feel like a normal man. I'm just Rama, the son of Dasaratha. I don't understand all this."

Brahma, the creator, smiled.  He explained, "Rama, you are Narayana, a great and powerful god! You are the hero who saved the world many times! You're the strongest, wisest, kindest god there is!  You came to Earth to defeat Ravana.  Sita is actually Lakshmi, the goddess of fortune!"

Brahma told Rama he was like the sun, the moon, and the stars â€“ he was everywhere! He was in all living things.  He was the world itself!

Brahma said, "You did a great job defeating Ravana! Now, it's time to go back to heaven!"

Rama was amazed.  He learned he was a powerful god all along! He felt happy and strong.  He knew he had done something wonderful.  He had saved Sita and defeated a terrible enemy.  And he was a powerful god, too.
