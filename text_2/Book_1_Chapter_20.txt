King Dasharatha woke up.  He looked at his son, Rama. Rama was only fifteen years old!  "Rama is too young to fight the scary demons," the King said.  "I have a big army! I'll fight the demons myself!"

King Dasharatha's army was strong and brave.  His soldiers were very good with their swords and bows.  "Please, don't ask Rama to go," the King begged the wise man, Vishvamitra. "He's too young to fight such powerful demons.  He doesn't know how to fight in a war."

Vishvamitra explained, "King, these demons are very, very strong!  They are led by Ravana, a powerful king.  He's even stronger than most gods! Two of his strongest demons, Marica and Subahu, are stopping your important ceremony."

King Dasharatha was worried.  "Even my army can't beat Ravana," he said. "How can my little Rama possibly fight him?  I won't let my son go!"

Vishvamitra was angry. The King's words made him very mad.  He was like a fire that was burning brighter and brighter.  The King wouldn't let his son, Rama, help!
