A giant bird fell to the ground.  It had been hurt by Ravana, a very bad king.  Sita, a beautiful princess, saw this and cried.  "Oh, Rama! Oh, Lakshmana!" she shouted.  "This bird tried to help me, but now it's hurt because of me!  Ravana is chasing me! Please help!"

Sita was scared. She was all alone. Ravana, who looked like death itself, grabbed her hair and pulled her into the air.  Everything went dark and quiet.  Even the sun seemed sad.  Good people everywhere were very upset.  They knew Ravana was doing something terrible.

Sita, dressed in a beautiful yellow sari, looked like a bright light against Ravana's dark skin.  As he flew, petals from her hair fell like a golden rain. Her jewelry, sparkling like stars, fell to the ground.

Animals and birds watched Sita being carried away.  They cried and felt very sad. Even the mountains and rivers seemed to weep. The sun became weak and dim.

Sita was very scared and sad.  She kept calling for Rama and Lakshmana.  Her face was pale.  She missed her home and family. Ravana took her away, but this would lead to his own downfall.
