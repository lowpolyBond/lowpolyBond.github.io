Bharata was furious with his stepmother, Kaikeyi.  "You're cruel and wicked!" he shouted. "You sent Rama away and now my father is dead!  You've ruined our family!  Because of you, I'm king, but I'm ashamed! You're not my mother, you're my enemy!"

He said Kaikeyi had done something as bad as killing a holy person.  "You should go away and leave! You don't deserve to be here!" he cried. "You hurt my mother, Queen Kaushalya, and my other mother, Queen Sumitra.  Rama was so good, and you banished him! Because of you, I've lost my father and my brothers!"

Bharata was so upset, he fell to the ground.  He cried and sobbed like a baby who had lost his toy.

Long ago, there was a magical cow named Kamadhenu.  She was so kind, and the gods loved her.  One day, she saw her sons working hard in the fields.  They were tired and hot.  Kamadhenu felt so sad for them that she started to cry.

Indra, the king of the gods, saw Kamadhenu crying.  He asked her why she was so sad. Kamadhenu said, "My sons are suffering.  Nothing is more precious to a mother than her children."

Indra understood. He knew how much a mother loves her son.  He thought about Queen Kaushalya, Rama's mother, and how heartbroken she must be.

Bharata continued to yell at Kaikeyi, "You made Queen Kaushalya lose her son. You’ll never be happy! I will take care of my brother, Rama. I’ll bring him home! Then I'll go live in the forest myself. You should die or go away.  Only when Rama returns will I be at peace!"  Then, heartbroken and angry, Bharata collapsed to the ground.
