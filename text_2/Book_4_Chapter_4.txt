Hanuman, a powerful monkey, heard Lakshmana speak kindly.  He knew Rama was a good king, and he was happy to help.  Hanuman thought, "Sugriva, the monkey king, will get his kingdom back with Rama's help!"

Then, Hanuman asked Rama and Lakshmana, "Why are you in this scary forest?"

Lakshmana told Hanuman their story.  "Our father, King Dasaratha, was a great king.  Rama, my brother, was the best. But he was sent away to live in the forest.  Rama's wife, Sita, was taken away by a powerful demon.  We don't know who took her.  Someone told us Sugriva could help us find her."

Lakshmana explained that Rama, even though a prince, was kind and helped everyone.  He said, "Rama is brave and good, but he needs help." Lakshmana's voice was sad.

Hanuman said, "Sugriva is sad too!  His own brother took his kingdom and wife. Sugriva will help you!"

Hanuman said, "Let's go find Sugriva!"

Lakshmana smiled. "This monkey is good and honest," he told Rama.

Hanuman, strong and quick, picked up Rama and Lakshmana.  He leaped and bounced across the mountains, taking them to Sugriva. He was so happy to help!
