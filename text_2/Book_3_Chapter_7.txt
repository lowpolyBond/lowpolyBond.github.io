Rama, Sita, Lakshmana, and some wise men were traveling. They walked a long way, crossing many rivers.  They saw a huge mountain! It was as big as the biggest mountain ever!

They walked into a forest filled with amazing trees and flowers.  They found a little house, all decorated with pretty flowers and leaves.  A very old, wise man named Sutikshna lived there.  His hair was long and messy, and he sat quietly.

Rama said hello.  He was very polite. He told Sutikshna his name.

Sutikshna was so happy to see Rama! He gave Rama a big hug! He said, "Welcome!  I've been waiting for you! I heard you were living in the forest because you had to leave your home." He told Rama that a very important god had told him about Rama and how amazing he was.  He gave Rama all his good luck and blessings.

Rama said, "Thank you! But I'm here because I had to leave my home, even though I could rule the whole world!"  He said another wise man had told him to help everyone.

Sutikshna said, "This is a wonderful place to live! There are lots of fruits and berries.  Beautiful deer live here, too."

Lakshmana said, "But I have my bow and arrows! I wouldn't want to hurt any of the deer!"

Rama and Lakshmana decided to stay for the night.  Sutikshna gave them some food to eat. Then Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana slept soundly in the hermitage.
