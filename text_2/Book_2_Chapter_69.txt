That night, Prince Bharata had a very bad dream.  When he woke up, he was very sad. His friends tried to cheer him up. They told jokes, played music, and danced.

But Bharata couldn't smile.  He said, "I had a terrible dream! I saw my father, the king, looking very unhappy. He was falling down a mountain into a big pile of cow dung!  He was covered in oil and eating messy food.

In my dream, the sea dried up, the moon fell down, and the world went dark. The elephants' tusks broke, and a big fire went out. The ground cracked, trees lost their leaves, and mountains smoked. I saw the king sitting on an iron chair, wearing dark clothes, and people making fun of him.  He was in a cart pulled by donkeys! And a scary monster laughed at him!

This dream means something bad will happen.  It could be me, Rama, Lakshmana, or even my father who will die.  Dreams about donkey carts mean someone will die soon.  I'm so scared! My heart hurts. I can hardly breathe."  Bharata was very worried about his father and his family.
