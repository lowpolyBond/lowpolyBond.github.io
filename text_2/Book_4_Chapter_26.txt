Sugriva, the monkey king, was very sad.  His clothes were wet from crying.  He and his friends were around Rama, a brave prince. Sugriva bowed low, just like wise people bow to a great teacher.

Hanuman, a strong monkey who looked like a golden mountain, spoke to Rama.  "Please, great Rama," he said, "help Sugriva get his kingdom back!  Let him be king again! After a nice bath, he'll give you lots of gifts."  Hanuman also showed Rama a big cave in the mountain, where they could all stay.

Rama was kind, but he said, "Hanuman, I can't go to cities for fourteen years. Sugriva should go back and be king now!"

Rama then told Sugriva, "Make your nephew, Angada, your heir. He's brave and strong, just like your brother. It's the rainy season, so wait to fight.  We'll fight Ravana later.  Live in this cave with us for now."

Sugriva went back to Kishkindha, his amazing city inside a mountain.  Lots and lots of monkeys cheered for him!  They made him king!

They gave him a beautiful throne, yummy food, and pretty things.  They poured special water over him to make him officially the king, just like they did for other great kings long ago.

Sugriva made Angada his heir. Everyone was happy!  The monkeys shouted and celebrated.  Sugriva then told Rama that he was king again. He went to live with his wife, Ruma, and was very happy in his kingdom.
