Rama, the brave prince, was getting ready for a big, important ceremony called the Ashvamedha Sacrifice.  He had a special horse, with black spots.  He gave the horse to Lakshmana to look after,  and then Rama went to the Naimisha Woods with his army.

The woods were beautiful! Rama was so happy to be there.  Many kings came to visit Rama and give him gifts. Rama was very kind. He gave everyone lots of food, drinks, and all sorts of good things.  Bharata and Shatrughna helped Rama.  Even the friendly monkeys and giants helped out!  They all made sure everyone was happy and comfortable.

Lakshmana kept a close eye on the special horse. Rama made sure everything was perfect for the sacrifice. He told everyone, "Ask for anything you want, and you shall have it!"  

Monkeys and giants gave out yummy sweets and treats until everyone had enough.  They gave out gold, jewels, and beautiful clothes. No one was hungry or sad! Everyone was happy and full.

The wise old people said they'd never seen such a generous sacrifice before!  Even the gods couldn't have done something so amazing.  Monkeys and giants kept giving away things – clothes, rice, silver, and gold!

Rama’s sacrifice lasted for a whole year!  Even after all that time, Rama still had lots of treasures left.  It was the best sacrifice ever!
