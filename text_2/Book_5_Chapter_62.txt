Hanuman told the monkey troop, "Go get honey! I'll scare away anyone who bothers you!"

Angada, a strong monkey prince, cheered, "Yes! Let's get honey!  We'll do what Hanuman says, even if it's a bit naughty!"

All the monkeys shouted, "Great idea!"  They rushed into the honey forest like a river! They pushed away the guards who tried to stop them.  They were happy because Hanuman had found Sita.

The monkeys ate lots of honey and fruit. They were so happy, some threw honeycombs at each other!  Some fell asleep from eating too much.  Others sang, roared like lions, or even cried!  It was a big party!

The forest guards ran to their boss, Dadhimukha.  "Those monkeys, led by Hanuman, wrecked the honey forest!" they cried.

Dadhimukha was angry. He told his guards, "Go back and stop them! I'll come too!"

The guards went back, but the monkeys, led by Hanuman, fought them again. Angada, even though he was Dadhimukha's nephew, was very drunk on honey and accidentally hurt Dadhimukha badly.

Poor Dadhimukha was hurt. He went to Sugriva, the monkey king, to tell him what happened.  He was very sad and worried.

Dadhimukha went to see Sugriva, Rama, and Lakshmana. He bowed down and told them what Angada had done.  He was very upset because the honey forest was very special to Sugriva.  Dadhimukha hoped Sugriva would punish the naughty monkeys.
