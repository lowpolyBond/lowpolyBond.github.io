In ancient times of monkeys bold and grand,
In Madhuvana, honey-rich land,
Hanuman, mighty 'mongst them all, did stand,
And thus to fellow monkeys, made his command:

"Cherish the honey with a cool mind, dear kin,
I'll guard your path from the foes within."

His words they heard, those monkeys brave,
Angada, noble, their hearts did crave,
Though Hanuman's words, some thought untimely,
They obliged their friend in their hearts so kindly.

With reverence they answered, "Good, good!" they cried,
To Angada, their chief, they all complied.
To Madhuvana, they rushed with glee,
Like a river's rush to a waiting tree.

For Hanuman had seen Sita fair,
And they had heard, her fate to share.
With Angada's nod, they stormed the gate,
Took honey and fruits, their joy innate.

Upon the guards, they fiercely leapt,
And honey-vessels in their arms, they kept.
Some threw the honey away in cheer,
While others in their arms, it did appear.

Intoxicated, they played and laughed,
Some to each other, jokes they chaffed.
Yellow as honey, their fur did gleam,
Inebriated by honey's sweet dream.

Some held branches under the trees' tall shade,
While others lay down on leaves they'd laid.
Some slept on the ground, lost in a trance,
Others stumbled about in their drunken dance.

Some roared like lions, wild and free,
Others whistled like birds in a tree.
Intoxicated monkeys, in their mirth,
Lay on the ground, spreading joy and girth.

The honey-keepers, in fear they fled,
As the monkeys' might filled them with dread.
Knees dragged, tossed in the air they soared,
To Dadhimukha's ears, their fate implored.

"Destruction in Madhuvana," they cried,
"By Hanuman's permit, we were defied.
Our knees they dragged, tossed in the air,
These monkeys so bold, beyond compare."

Dadhimukha, the grove's protector, so fierce,
Heard the news and his anger did pierce.
"Come, let's stop these arrogant fools,
With our might, we'll enforce the rules."

To Madhuvana, Dadhimukha did speed,
Monkeys followed, their strength indeed.
With trees, rocks, and mountains to wield,
They went to the place where their kin revealed.

The guards, in thousands, charged ahead,
Monkeys in trees, on ground, they'd tread.
Seeing Dadhimukha, anger in his eyes,
Hanuman and others toward him did rise.

Angada, enraged, his arms he swung,
At Dadhimukha, his kin among,
Blinded by arrogance, he showed no grace,
And brought his uncle down in that very place.

Dadhimukha, the mighty, bloodied and sore,
Battered and broken, but he rose once more.
He scolded the monkeys, intoxicated and high,
With stern words, their behavior did decry.

Somehow released, Dadhimukha did retreat,
To a solitary spot, his defeat to greet.
He spoke to his messengers with despair,
"Stay here, we'll tell our lord, if he'll dare."

"We'll go to Sugriva, so thick-necked and strong,
Tell him the misdeeds that have gone wrong.
He'll punish Angada, make the monkeys pay,
For this Madhuvana, in danger, they stay."

"Their lifespan shortened by honey's delight,
Sugriva can punish them with all his might.
They disobeyed his royal command,
Deserve punishment, I'm sure you understand."

Their wrath, fueled by impatience, grew,
To punish these monkeys, they were eager to do.
With garden-guards, Dadhimukha took flight,
Back to Kishkindha, where Sugriva's light.

Descending from the sky, he appeared before their sight,
Dadhimukha, mighty, his heart heavy with the fight.
Before Sugriva, with a bowed head he knelt,
Seeking justice for the misdeeds they had smelt.
