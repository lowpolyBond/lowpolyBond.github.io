Long ago, in a kingdom far away, lived King Dasaratha. He wanted sons very badly!  A wise man, Sage Sanatkumara, told him a story.

The story said that King Dasaratha would become friends with another king, King Lomapada.  King Lomapada had a special friend, a wise man named Rishyasringa.  This wise man could help King Dasaratha have sons!

King Dasaratha went to see King Lomapada. He asked nicely if Rishyasringa could come and help him. King Lomapada said, "Yes!"  Rishyasringa, and his wife Princess Shanta, went with King Dasaratha back to his kingdom.

It was a long journey through forests and rivers!  When they arrived, everyone was so happy!  The people of Ayodhya cheered. They were excited to meet the wise man and his wife.

King Dasaratha treated Rishyasringa and Princess Shanta like honored guests.  The queens welcomed Princess Shanta warmly.  They lived in the palace and were very happy.

Because of Rishyasringaâ€™s help, King Dasaratha soon had a special ceremony. And guess what?  He had four amazing sons!  The story of Sage Sanatkumara came true!
