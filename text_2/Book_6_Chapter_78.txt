In fiery rage, Ravana's heart did blaze,
When news of fallen demons reached his ear.
Both Nikumbha and Kumbha met their end,
Their deaths invoking wrath, despair, and fear.

He turned to Makaraksha, son of Khara bold,
With orders to the battlefield he flew.
"I charge you now, my son," Ravana spoke,
"Go forth, kill Rama, Lakshmana, and their crew."

With dutiful resolve, Makaraksha vowed,
To carry out his king's command with pride.
He summoned chariot, army to his side,
And swore to slay the heroes, far and wide.

With regal stride, he circled his chariot,
Assembled demons ready for the fray.
"Prepare for battle," Makaraksha cried,
"For Ravana's will, we shall not be led astray."

With tusks and tawny eyes, their forms transformed,
These demons, fierce and strong, to war did swarm.
They marched like elephants, a roaring storm,
Their might and terror causing hearts to warm.

The chariot's whip fell from the charioteer's grasp,
The flag-staff dropped, portending doom and fear.
The horses, eyes awash with tears, did gasp,
As dust-storms marked the demon's path, clear.

But heedless of the omens in the air,
These demons, valiant, marched with dauntless flair.
With swords and maces raised, they showed no care,
And charged to face the heroes, bold and rare.

Makaraksha thundered, "I lead the way,
Today, Rama, Lakshmana, shall not survive!
With arrows keen, their lives I will repay,
And end this battle, for their end has arrived!"
