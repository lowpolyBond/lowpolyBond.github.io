King Ravana was furious!  His friends, Nikumbha and Kumbha, had been killed. He roared like a volcano!  He called his son, Maharaksha, a very strong and brave warrior.

"My son," Ravana yelled, "go kill Rama and Lakshmana! Kill all their friends in the forest!"

Maharaksha, proud and strong, said, "Yes, Father!" He bowed to Ravana and left.

He told his army to get ready.  "Bring my chariot!" he commanded.  "Gather the troops!"

Soon, Maharaksha was in his chariot.  He told his army, "We're going to fight Rama and Lakshmana! I will defeat them! I will crush the monkeys! We will win!"

His army was HUGE!  They were giants, strong and scary. They had sharp claws and roared like elephants.  They banged drums and blew horns, making a terrible noise.

Suddenly, something strange happened! Maharaksha's chariot driver dropped his whip! The chariot flag fell down! The horses stumbled and cried. A big dust storm blew up!

Even though these things were scary, Maharaksha and his army didn't stop. They were brave, and they marched forward to fight Rama and Lakshmana.  They shouted, "Here we come!"  They were ready for battle!
