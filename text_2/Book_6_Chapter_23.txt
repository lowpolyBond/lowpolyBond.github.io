Rama, Lakshmana's older brother, saw scary signs. He knew what they meant!  He hugged Lakshmana and said, "Lakshmana, look! This place has lots of water and yummy fruits. Let's get our army ready to fight!  I see a big danger coming.  It could destroy the world!"

Rama explained, "See that huge dust storm? The ground is shaking! Mountains are trembling! Trees are falling!  The clouds look like scary monsters, and it's raining blood! The sky is dark and red.  The sun is scary, and it's even falling fire!  Animals are scared and crying!  The moon is dark and spooky. It looks like the end of the world!  Even the sun looks sick and weak.  There's so much dust, we can't see the stars!  Birds of prey are falling from the sky, and jackals are howling!"

He pointed to the battlefield, "Monkeys and demons are throwing rocks and spears!  It's a terrible mess!  We have to attack Ravana's city NOW!"

Rama grabbed his bow and arrow. He was ready to fight!  All the brave monkeys, led by Sugriva and Vibhishana, shouted, "Let's fight!"  They were so excited to help Rama, and Rama was very happy to see them so brave.  They all marched towards Ravana's city, Lanka!
