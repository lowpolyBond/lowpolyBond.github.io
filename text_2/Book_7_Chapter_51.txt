Lakshmana asked the driver, "What did the wise man say?"

The driver said, "A long time ago, a very powerful holy man named Durvasa visited King Dasaratha.  King Dasaratha was very respectful. He asked Durvasa, 'How long will my family rule? How long will Rama live?  And my other sons? And Rama's sons?'"

Durvasa told a story. "A long time ago, the gods and demons fought.  The demons hid with the wife of a powerful holy man named Bhrigu. The gods were angry!  A god cut off Bhrigu's wife's head.  Bhrigu was very sad and angry. He cursed Vishnu, a very powerful god, saying, 'Because you killed my wife, you must be born as a human and be away from your wife for a long time!'"

"Bhrigu felt bad later and asked Vishnu to forgive him. Vishnu said, 'Okay, I will follow your curse, to help the world.' That's why Vishnu became your son, Rama!" the driver explained. "Rama will rule Ayodhya for a very, very long time. He'll be happy and make his people happy.  He'll rule for eleven thousand years! Then he'll go to heaven. He'll have two sons with Sita."

The driver finished, "That's what Durvasa said.  Everything he said will happen. Don't worry about Rama or Sita, Lakshmana."

Lakshmana said, "That's wonderful news!"

The sun went down. Lakshmana and the driver stopped by the Keshini River to rest.
