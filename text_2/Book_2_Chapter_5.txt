King Dasaratha told his son, Rama, he was going to be the next king!  He asked the wise teacher, Vasishtha, to tell Rama and his wife, Sita, to have a special day of fasting.  It was like getting ready for a big party!

Vasishtha rode in his chariot to Rama's palace.  Rama was so happy to see him! They talked, and Vasishtha explained that Rama would be king the next day.  He asked Rama and Sita to fast that night.

Rama bowed to Vasishtha, and the wise teacher went home. Rama talked with his friends, and then he and Sita went to bed. The palace was full of happy people! It was like a beautiful garden full of birds!

Outside, the streets were crowded! Everyone was excited for Ramaâ€™s coronation.  It was so busy, it was hard to walk!  The city was decorated with flowers and flags.  Everyone was waiting for the big day!

Vasishtha went back to the palace, avoiding the crowds.  He told King Dasaratha that everything was ready. The king was very happy.  He left the big room, just like a lion going back to its cave.  He went to his own special room to rest.
