A very clever monkey talked to Sita.  He told her a story about a great king named Dasaratha.  King Dasaratha was kind and brave, like a real hero. His son, Rama, was even braver. Rama was super strong and a wonderful archer.

One day, Rama, his wife Sita, and his brother had to go live in the forest. While they were there, Rama fought lots of scary giants!  

A bad king named Ravana heard about Rama.  He was very jealous.  Ravana tricked Sita. He used magic to make a deer look very pretty.  Rama went to chase the deer, and Ravana quickly took Sita away!

Rama looked everywhere for Sita. He made friends with a monkey named Sugriva.  Together, they helped many monkeys search for Sita.  This clever monkey was one of them!  He had even flown across a huge ocean to find her!

The monkey told Sita all about Rama. He told her how handsome and good Rama was. Sita was so happy to hear news of her husband! She looked all around, and there he was! The monkey, who looked like the sun, pointed the way to Rama's rescue.
