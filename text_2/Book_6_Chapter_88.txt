Indrajit, Ravana's son, was very angry. He yelled at Vibhishana and jumped into his chariot.  His chariot was shiny and pulled by black horses. He held his bow and arrows, looking fierce and scary.

Then, Lakshmana, shining brightly on Hanuman's back, appeared. Indrajit shouted, "Look at my power!  My arrows will rain down on you! They'll tear you apart! I'll send you all to the land of the dead!" He boasted about winning a past battle.

Lakshmana answered, "It's easy to brag, but it's harder to do it!  You hide, that's not fair! Show me your strength!"

Indrajit shot his arrows. They hissed like snakes and hit Lakshmana. Lakshmana was hurt, but he didn't give up.  Indrajit yelled again, "I'll kill you, Lakshmana!  Rama will see his brother dead!"

Lakshmana said, "Stop boasting! Show me your skill, don't just talk about it!"

Lakshmana then shot his own arrows, hitting Indrajit hard in the chest.  Indrajit shot back, and they fought a big battle! They were both strong and brave.  They shot so many arrows, it was like a storm of arrows!  It was a fierce battle between two amazing warriors.
