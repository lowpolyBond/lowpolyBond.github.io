As Vibhishaṇ's words stoked Indrajit's ire,
He rushed forth in fury, eyes burning like fire.
A chariot adorned, black horses in stride,
With a massive swift bow and arrows at his side.

A formidable foe, both valiant and skilled,
Indrajit spoke with might, his purpose revealed:
"Behold my prowess, face my lethal rain,
Arrows shall fall like thunder, a deadly bane.

Today you shall meet your doom in this fray,
By my arrows, you'll be cast away.
Let jackals and vultures descend in a swarm,
When your lifeless bodies meet this grave harm.

Recall that first night when my arrows flew,
Both you and your brother in slumber they slew.
Today, once again, my might shall declare,
As I pierce you with arrows, your life to snare.

Witness my power, my arrows like thunderbolts,
Swift as the wind, no one escapes their jolts.
My strength will prevail, your doom is nigh,
For Rama to witness, your end by my sky."

Lakshmana, undaunted, with courage proclaimed,
"Empty words won't deter, our honor untamed.
Deeds speak louder than speech, let actions show,
In this battlefield, your might we'll know.

Your path of invisibility, we've heard before,
But thieves and the wicked that pathway explore.
True warriors fight with honor and might,
Not with boasts and threats, but a valiant fight.

Arise, O demon, show your strength in strife,
Or cease your empty words, reclaim your life.
If I remain untouched by your feeble art,
Consider your victory just an empty chart."

With a swift and fierce volley, arrows took flight,
Lakshmana and Indrajit, locked in a fight.
Steel against steel, in this battle so dire,
Both warriors clashed like two flames of fire.

Arrows like serpents, venomous in flight,
Struck both champions, fierce was the fight.
With blood on their bodies, and senses awry,
They fought on, unyielding, aiming for the sky.

Two heroes locked in a relentless dance,
Piercing each other, with every chance.
As arrows flew fast, with a deafening sound,
They stood their ground, on the battlefield's ground.

Bloodied and battered, but resolute still,
They fought on, with unwavering will.
No fatigue in their eyes, no thought of retreat,
Only the sound of clashing arrows and feet.

The battlefield echoed, the sky roared in rage,
As they continued this martial engage.
A clash of titans, a battle of might,
Two warriors vying, refusing the night.

And as the battle raged on, relentless and long,
Vibhishaṇ observed, wise and strong.
For Lakshmana's weariness, he sought to allay,
And joined the fierce combat, to aid in the fray.
