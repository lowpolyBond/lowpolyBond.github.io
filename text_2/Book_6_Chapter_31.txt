King Ravana's spies told him that Rama and his army were nearby.  Ravana was worried! He called a meeting with his advisors.  They talked about what to do.  Then Ravana went to see Sita.

He took a powerful magician named Vidyujjihva with him.  Ravana told Vidyujjihva, "Use your magic to trick Sita! Make a fake Rama's head and bow and arrow!"

Vidyujjihva did as he was told.  Ravana was pleased and gave him nice clothes.  He went to the Ashoka Grove where Sita was sad and alone.

Ravana pretended that Rama was dead.  He showed Sita a fake head and bow.  He lied, "Rama is dead!  His army was defeated!  Now you are mine!"

Ravana made up a story about a big battle at night.  He said his army had killed all of Ramaâ€™s friends.  Hanuman, Sugriva, and many others were supposedly dead.  He showed Sita the fake head and bow as proof.

Ravana told Sita, "Rama is dead!  Become my queen!"  He was mean and cruel.  He wanted Sita to be his wife.
