Hanuman, the mighty monkey, had already defeated the guards of Ravana's garden.  He looked at the temple. "I've destroyed the garden," he thought, "but not the temple.  I'll destroy it now!"

Hanuman jumped up to the huge temple.  It was as tall as a mountain! He shone brightly, like the rising sun.  He started to break apart the amazing temple.  He was so strong, he made the whole island of Lanka shake!  His loud roars scared the birds and the temple guards. They fell to the ground, too scared to move.

Hanuman shouted, "Victory to Rama and Lakshmana! Victory to King Sugriva! I am Hanuman, Rama's servant!  I'm so strong, not even a thousand Ravanas could stop me! I'll destroy Lanka, then I'll go home!"

Hanuman roared again. The sound frightened everyone.  A hundred guards rushed at him with swords, axes, and spears. They attacked him, but Hanuman was too powerful!

He got angry.  He ripped a huge, golden pillar from the temple.  He swung it around so fast, it caught fire! The temple was burning!  He defeated many guards easily. It was like a god defeating evil spirits!

Hanuman stood in the air and shouted, "Thousands of strong monkeys are coming!  They're as strong as elephants, or even stronger! They'll destroy Lanka and Ravana!  No one will be safe!"
