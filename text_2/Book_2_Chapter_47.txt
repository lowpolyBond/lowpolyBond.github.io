The sun came up, but Rama was gone!  The people of Ayodhya woke up and couldn't find him.  They were very sad.  They looked everywhere, their eyes filled with tears.  They couldn't find any clues about where he went.

"Oh, no!" they cried. "We slept too long!  We'll never see Rama's kind face again!  He's gone to the forest, and left us behind!  What will we do without him? We might as well die!"  Some even wanted to build a fire and die together.  They were too sad to go home without him.  What would they tell everyone else? They couldn't bear the thought of telling people they'd left Rama alone.

They followed the marks of his chariot wheels, hoping to find him. But the marks disappeared. They were so heartbroken, they fell to the ground.  They had to go back home without him.

When they returned to Ayodhya, the city felt empty and sad. It was like a river without water, or the sky without a moon.  The people didn't even recognize their own family members! They were too sad to notice anything else.  They went home with heavy hearts, missing Rama terribly.
