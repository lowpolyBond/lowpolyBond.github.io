King Bali was relaxing with his wives when he heard a loud, angry yell.  It was his brother, Sugriva!  Bali got so angry that he looked scary, like the sun when it's covered. His eyes flashed, and he stomped so hard the ground shook!

Then, his wife Tara hugged him.  She was worried.  "My brave husband," she said, "your anger is like a rushing river!  Don't rush to fight Sugriva right now. Wait until morning."

Tara was very clever.  She explained, "Sugriva yelled like that before, and you beat him.  But this time, something feels different.  I think Sugriva has friends to help him."

"A young prince told me," Tara whispered, "that Sugriva made friends with two amazing princes, Rama and Lakshmana!  They are super strong and brave. Rama is like a superhero; everyone loves him.  He's incredibly powerful and kind."

"Bali," Tara continued, "don't fight Rama!  Make friends with him instead.  Be kind to Sugriva, too. He's your brother.  Give him gifts.  Bring him back home. Itâ€™s much better to have him as a friend than an enemy!"

Tara gave Bali the best advice, but he was too angry to listen. He rushed off to fight, and sadly, he didn't listen to his clever wife.
