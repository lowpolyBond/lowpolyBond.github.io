One day, after autumn ended and winter arrived, Rama went to the beautiful Godavari River to wash.  His brother Lakshmana, carrying a water pot, walked behind him with Sita.

Lakshmana said, "Brother, winter is here!  It's cold! The ground is frosty, and the water isn't nice to drink anymore.  People offer food to the gods, and everyone is busy. Kings are getting ready for battles. The sun is weak now, like a faded picture.  The Himavat mountains are covered in snow!  The nights are long and freezing; even the stars are hidden. The moon is dim, not bright like usual."

He continued, "The wind is icy.  The fields are sparkly with frost.  Birds are calling. The rice plants are heavy with grain. The sun is weak, but it gets warmer at midday.  Even elephants are afraid of the freezing water! Birds won't go in the river. The trees look sleepy, covered in mist.  The water in the rocks tastes sweet now, but the lotuses are frozen and dead.  Bharata, our brother, is doing a very hard thing.  He's living simply because he misses you so much. He's very cold and sad.  He's bathing in the Sarayu River right now.  Bharata is so good and kind, always thinking of you, Rama."

Lakshmana then said something surprising: "It's said that people look like their mothers, not their fathers.  If that's true, how could Mother Kaikeyi be so unkind?"

Rama replied, "Lakshmana, we shouldn't speak badly of our mother.  Let's talk about Bharata. I remember his kind words. I miss Bharata and Shatrughna so much! I wish we could be together again."

Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana washed in the Godavari River. They prayed to the gods and the sun, feeling clean and peaceful. They looked beautiful together, like a picture from a storybook.
