Once upon a time, a wise holy man named Narada went to see the god of death, Yama. Narada had important news.  He told Yama that a powerful demon king, Ravana (also called Dashagriva), was coming to attack him!

Just then, BOOM! Ravana arrived in his amazing flying chariot, the Pushpaka. It was bright and shiny like the sun!  Ravana saw many spirits in Yama's place. Some were happy, because they had been good.  Others were sad and hurting, because they had been bad.  Some were even burning in hot sand!

Ravana, being powerful and mean, freed all the spirits who were suffering.  This made Yama's soldiers very angry! They attacked Ravana's chariot with swords and spears.  The chariot was broken, but it magically fixed itself!

The battle was HUGE!  Ravana's army and Yama's army fought hard. They threw rocks, trees, and arrows at each other.  Ravana was hurt, but he was brave. He jumped out of his chariot and fought even harder!

Ravana was so strong! He fought against thousands of Yama's soldiers all by himself!  Finally, he used a super-powerful arrow.  It was so fiery and bright, it burned many of Yama's soldiers to ashes!  The whole place shook from the roar of the battle!
