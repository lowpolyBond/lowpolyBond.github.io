King Sugriva had a great plan. He knew just the monkey to help: Hanuman! Hanuman was super strong and brave.

Sugriva told Hanuman, "Hanuman, you're the best! You can go anywhere â€“ up in the sky, down in the sea, even to the magical places!  You're as fast and strong as your dad, the Wind God!  There's no one like you! Find Sita!"

Rama, the king, thought, "Hanuman is the perfect monkey for this job! He's already proven himself." Rama felt happy and sure that Hanuman would succeed.  Rama gave Hanuman a ring with his name on it.  "Give this to Sita," Rama said. "She'll know you're my messenger."  He added, "Your strength and Sugriva's plan make me think you'll succeed!"

Hanuman bowed to Rama. He took the ring and put it on his forehead. Then, with lots of other monkeys, he set off. He looked like the moon shining brightly in the night sky.

Rama said to Hanuman, "My strong friend, I trust you!  Bring Sita back to me!"  And off Hanuman went on his big adventure!
