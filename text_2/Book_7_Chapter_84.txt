Rama talked to Bharata, his brother.  Then Lakshmana spoke to Bharata, too.  He said, "Bharata, you should do a special ceremony called the Ashvamedha sacrifice. It washes away all bad deeds!"

Lakshmana told a story.  "Long ago, a powerful god named Indra did something wrong.  To become good again, he did the Ashvamedha sacrifice.  Another story is about a giant named Vritra. He was HUGE!  He was kind and ruled his land well.  Everything grew beautifully, without even needing to be planted!

But Vritra decided to do a very, very hard thing. He wanted to be super holy, so he did a super tough fast. He was so holy that he even scared the other gods!

Indra, the king of the gods, was really worried. Vritra was becoming so powerful that Indra knew he couldn't win!  So, Indra went to Vishnu, a very powerful god, for help.  Indra said, "Vritra is too strong!  He’s scared us all! Please, Vishnu, you’re the only one strong enough to defeat him!"  Vishnu helped, and Indra won.  The story shows how powerful this sacrifice is!"
