Once upon a time, the mean king Ravana kidnapped Princess Sita.  He carried her away in the sky.  Sita was very sad and scared. She didn't see anyone to help her.  Then, she saw five monkeys on a mountain!

She dropped her pretty gold cloak and jewels for them.  She hoped they would tell Rama, her husband, where she was.  Ravana was too busy to notice. The monkeys saw Sita crying.

Ravana flew across rivers, forests, and mountains. Even the ocean was scared as he zoomed by!  Some magical beings in the sky shouted, "Ravana's in trouble!" But Ravana didn't care. He was happy, even though he was carrying his own doom, like a poisonous snake!

He took Sita to his palace in Lanka.  He told his scary guards, "No one can look at Sita without my permission! Give her whatever she wants! Anyone who's mean to her will die!"

Ravana then spoke to eight super-strong, scary demons.  He said, "Go to Janasthana!  Rama killed my friends there, Khara and Dushana.  I want revenge! Watch Rama, and tell me everything he does.  Kill him if you can!"

The demons promised to help and secretly went to Janasthana.  Ravana was so happy he got Sita, he didn't think about the trouble he was in.  He didn't realize that taking Sita was a very bad idea!
