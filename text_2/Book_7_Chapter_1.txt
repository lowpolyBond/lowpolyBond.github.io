After Rama won the big battle and got his kingdom back, lots and lots of wise people came to see him.  They came from all over the land!  Some came from the east, some from the south, some from the west, and some from the north.  They were all super smart and knew lots about the ancient stories and songs.

These wise people, called sages, were led by a very important sage named Agastya.  They all looked like they were glowing! Agastya politely told the palace guard, "Tell Prince Rama that we are here!"

The guard quickly went to tell Rama. Rama, who was as bright as the moon, said, "Please show them in with lots of respect!"

The sages came in, and Rama stood up to greet them. He gave them gifts and comfy seats made of soft grass and animal skins.

Then, the sages praised Rama for winning the big battle.  They said, "Rama, you defeated the terrible Ravana and all his mean friends! You fought Kumbhakarna, the giant, and even Indrajit, who was super strong!"

Rama was surprised. He said, "But I beat lots of other strong guys too! Why are you only praising me for defeating Indrajit? How was he so special?"

The sages explained that Indrajit was even stronger than his dad, Ravana!  He had magic powers from a special wish he'd been given. That's why they were so impressed Rama beat him.  Rama was amazed to hear how powerful Indrajit really was!
