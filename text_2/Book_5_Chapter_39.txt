Sita gave Hanuman a special jewel.  "Rama will know this," she said. "He'll remember me, my mother, and his father, King Dasaratha."  She asked Hanuman to help her. "Please, help Rama save me!"

Hanuman bowed.  He was ready to go. But Sita, crying, said, "Tell Rama I miss him! Tell Lakshmana, Sugriva, and all the monkeys I hope they are well.  Tell him to hurry and save me before it's too late!  When Rama hears my message, he'll be even braver!"

Hanuman said, "I will!" He promised Sita that Rama, with his monkey and bear friends, would come soon.  "No one can stop Rama!" he said.  "He's the strongest!"

But Sita worried.  "Hanuman," she said, "how will Rama cross the big ocean? Only Garuda, you, and the wind god can do that!"

Hanuman smiled.  "Don't worry! Sugriva, Rama's friend, has a big army of super-strong monkeys. They are faster than the wind! Some are even stronger than me!  They can even fly! They will reach Lanka easily, and carry me on his back.  Rama and Lakshmana will come, defeat Ravana, and bring you home!"

Hanuman said, "Stay here one more day. Seeing me will make you feel a little better.  I'll leave tomorrow. You'll see Rama very soon. He'll be as brave as ever!"

Hanuman wanted to comfort Sita. "Rama and Lakshmana will soon arrive," he said. "You'll see thousands of monkeys fighting. They are very strong!  Don't worry, beautiful Sita, you will soon be reunited with Rama!"  Then Hanuman left to find Rama.
