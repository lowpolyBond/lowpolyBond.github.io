Note from Griffith:

I omit two Cantos of dialogue. Sítá tells Hanumán again to convey her
message to Ráma and bid him hasten to rescue her. Hanumán replies as
before that there is no one on earth equal to Ráma, who will soon come and
destroy Rávaṇ. There is not a new idea in the two Cantos: all is
reiteration.
