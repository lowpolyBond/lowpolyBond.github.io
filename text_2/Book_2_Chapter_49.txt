Prince Rama was on a long journey.  He had promised his dad he would go.  He traveled all night!  When the sun came up, he kept going.  Soon, he was leaving his kingdom.

He rode his fast horses past fields of crops and beautiful forests.  He heard people talking sadly. They said, "King Dasaratha is a bad king.  His wife, Kaikeyi, is very mean! She sent Prince Rama away!  Poor Sita, she'll have to live in the forest. Rama is so kind and good. Why would his father do this?"

Rama felt sad, but he kept going. He crossed a river called Vedasruti. Then he crossed another river, the Gaumati.  Lots of cows were grazing there!  His horses splashed through the water. Next, he crossed the Syandika River.  He heard peacocks and ducks calling. Rama showed Sita the land that belonged to their family long ago – it was a big, beautiful place.

Rama talked to his driver, Sumantra. He said, "Oh, Sumantra, I wish I could be back home soon, playing in the woods with my parents. I like hunting in the forest.  It’s something kings do. I’ll hunt after I’ve finished my time in the forest."

Rama kept talking to Sumantra kindly. He was determined to keep his promise and go where he was sent.
