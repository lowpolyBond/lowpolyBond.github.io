Once upon a time, a woman named Diti was expecting a baby.  But something went wrong!  The baby was split into seven parts!  Diti was very sad.  She talked to a powerful god named Indra.  She said, "It's my fault, Indra.  Please don't be angry.  My seven babies will be special.  They will be the wind gods!"

Indra, who had a thousand eyes, agreed.  He said, "Your sons will be amazing! They'll be called Maruts, and they'll protect the world." Diti and Indra were happy again and went to heaven.

Rama, this is a special place, the Tapovana forest.  This is where Indra helped his mother a long time ago. A long, long time ago, a good king named Vishala built a big city here.  His son was Hemacandra, and his son was Sucandra, and so on and so on!  Many good kings ruled this city after Vishala.

Now, a strong king named Pramati ruled Vishala.  One day, a wise and powerful man named Vishvamitra came to visit.  King Pramati was so happy! He welcomed Vishvamitra with gifts and kind words.  He said, “It’s an honor to have you in my kingdom!”

Rama, let’s stay here tonight. Tomorrow, we’ll go see King Janaka.
