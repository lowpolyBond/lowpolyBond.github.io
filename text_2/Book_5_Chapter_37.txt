Hanuman told Sita that Rama was very sad and missed her terribly.  He said that everyone has to die someday, but Rama was trying his best to save her.

Sita was worried.  "Hanuman," she said, "Ravana said I have to die soon!  His brother, Vibhishana, begged him to let me go, but Ravana wouldn't.  Even a wise giant warned Ravana that Rama would defeat him, but Ravana didn't listen.  Please tell Rama to hurry! I only have a few months left."

Sita told Hanuman about Rama's amazing strength and bravery.  "Heâ€™s like the sun," she said, "shining brightly and powerful enough to defeat anyone!"

Hanuman said, "I can bring you back to Rama right now! Hop on my back!"

Sita was surprised. "But you're so small! How can you carry me across the ocean?"

Hanuman then grew HUGE!  He became as big as a mountain!  "I can even uproot Lanka!" he boomed.

But Sita was still worried. "What if the giants see you and attack? What if I fall into the ocean? It's too dangerous!" she said.  "It's best if Rama comes with you to defeat Ravana." Sita knew that Rama was the only one who could truly save her, and she wouldn't want to put Hanuman in danger.  She also knew that Rama's safety and the safety of everyone else depended on her rescue.  She was completely devoted to Rama and only wanted to be reunited with him.

Sita asked Hanuman to bring Rama, Lakshmana, and Sugriva to rescue her instead. She wanted to be reunited with her beloved Rama, and she trusted that only he could bring her back safely.
