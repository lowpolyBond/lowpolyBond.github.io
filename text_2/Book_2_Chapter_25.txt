Once upon a time, Queen Kaushalya was sad because her son, Prince Rama, had to leave home.  She held back her tears, took a sip of water, and prayed for Rama's safety.

She said, "My dear Rama, please go.  Be brave and always do what's right. May the gods, the wise people who taught you, and all the good things in the world protect you! May your kindness to your father, mother, and everyone keep you safe. May the grass, trees, animals, and even the mountains keep you safe! May all the good gods, like Brahma and Indra, bless you!"

She prayed for Rama's safety everywhere â€“ in the forest, on the land, in the sky, even from scary things like monsters and snakes! She prayed that he'd always find food and that his journey would be easy.  She asked the sun, moon, and stars to watch over him.  She even asked the fire, wind, and even the gods she hadn't mentioned to keep him safe.

Then, Queen Kaushalya asked wise priests to pray for Rama.  They did a special ceremony with fire, flowers, and good smells.  They gave Rama blessings, just like when a god defeats a bad guy.  She gave the priests lots of yummy food.

She told Rama, "May you be as lucky as the great heroes of old!  My heart will be full of joy when you come back, my dear son, and become king!"  She hugged Rama tightly and kissed his head.

With tears in her eyes, the Queen hugged Rama again and again and walked around him, looking at his face.  Rama touched her feet to show his respect, and then he went to see his wife, Sita.
