Sugriva thanked the monkeys for their help.  He sent them all home.  He felt like the mission to help Rama was almost finished!

Lakshmana, Rama's brother, kindly asked Sugriva, "Friend, let's leave Kishkindha now!"

Sugriva was happy. "Yes, let's go!" he said.

He said goodbye to his wife Tara and the other monkey ladies. Then he shouted, "Monkeys! Come here!"

Lots of monkeys came running.  Sugriva was as bright as the sun! He said, "Quickly, bring a palanquin!"

The monkeys rushed off and brought a beautiful palanquin.  Sugriva said, "Lakshmana, please get in."

Lakshmana and Sugriva rode in the shiny golden palanquin.  Many monkeys carried it.  A white cloth was over Sugriva's head, and monkeys fanned him with yak tails.  Music played as they went.

Soon, they arrived where Rama was. Sugriva and Lakshmana got out.  They bowed to Rama.  All the monkeys bowed too.  Rama saw the huge group of monkeys and smiled.

Rama lifted Sugriva up and hugged him. He said, "A good king takes care of his people and his work. He doesn't just sleep all day!  You must help me now, Sugriva."

Sugriva said, "Rama, I lost everything, but you helped me. I'll never forget that! My army is coming!  There are hundreds, thousands, even millions of monkeys, bears, and apes!  They're strong and brave.  They’ll help us fight Ravana and bring back Sita!"

Rama was very happy to hear Sugriva’s plan.  He felt hopeful and excited, just like a beautiful blue lotus in bloom!
