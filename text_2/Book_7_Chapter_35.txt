Once upon a time, Prince Rama was talking to a wise old sage. Rama said, "Hanuman is the strongest and bravest monkey I know! He crossed a huge ocean, destroyed a city, and even found Sita in the evil king Ravana's palace!  He's amazing!"

The sage smiled. "Rama, you're right. Hanuman is incredibly powerful. But when he was a little baby, something funny happened."

The sage told Rama this story:  Hanuman’s dad was the Wind God.  His mom, Anjana, was a beautiful monkey.  One day, little Hanuman was very hungry. He saw the sun and thought it was a big, juicy fruit!  He jumped up into the sky to grab it!

Wow!  Hanuman was so fast that he zoomed past the sun.  The gods, demons, and spirits were all amazed! Even the sun was surprised.  A mean demon named Rahu was also trying to grab the sun, but he got scared of Hanuman and ran away.  Then, Hanuman saw Rahu and thought *he* was a fruit!  He went after him!

Next, Hanuman saw Indra’s elephant, Airavata, and thought it was another fruit. He tried to grab it!  Indra, the king of the gods, was angry. He threw a thunderbolt, and BOOM!  Little Hanuman fell and hurt his jaw.

Hanuman's dad, the Wind God, was furious! He got so mad that he stopped the wind all over the world! Nobody could breathe!  Everyone was scared and sad. They went to the creator god, Prajapati, for help.

Prajapati went to find the Wind God and his baby.  They were all sorry for what happened.  The Wind God agreed to let the wind blow again. But because of the curse, Hanuman didn’t know how strong he really was until he grew up.

That's why Hanuman seemed so powerful to Rama—he finally learned how strong he truly was!  The sage finished his story.  Rama finally understood why Hanuman was so amazing, even if he was a little silly as a baby!
