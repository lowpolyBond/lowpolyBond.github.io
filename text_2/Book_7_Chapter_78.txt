Long ago, a kind king named Shveta ruled a kingdom.  He was a good king, and everyone loved him. After many years, Shveta felt old. He wanted to be a better person, so he went to a quiet forest to pray.  He left his brother Suratha to be king.

Shveta prayed very hard for a very, very long time, even longer than you can imagine!  His prayers were so good that he went to heaven! But in heaven, he was always hungry and thirsty.

He asked the great God Brahma, "Why am I hungry in heaven?" Brahma said, "Shveta, you prayed hard but didn't share your food with others. So, you must eat your own body."  

Shveta was sad.  He ate his own body, but it never went away!  He was still hungry! Then Brahma told him, "A powerful wise man named Agastya can help you. When he comes, he will save you."

Years passed.  Then, one day, Shveta met Rama, a very brave prince.  Shveta begged Rama, "Please help me! I'm so hungry! I'll give you anything!"  He gave Rama a beautiful, shiny jewel.  

As soon as Rama took the jewel, Shveta's body disappeared!  He was no longer hungry and happy to be in heaven. That's why Shveta gave Rama the special jewel.
