Rama had just gotten some super-powerful weapons from a wise old sage.  He was so happy!  He asked the sage, "How do I put these weapons away after I use them?"

The sage, very patiently, showed Rama exactly how.  Then he gave Rama even MORE amazing weapons!  He gave him so many, it's hard to remember them all – they had names like Satyavana, Satyakirti, and many more.  The sage said, "Rama, these weapons are yours. Use them wisely!"

Rama said, "Thank you!"

The sage then showed Rama the weapons. Some glowed like fire, some were smoky, and some looked like the sun and moon!  Little magical helpers lived inside the weapons.  They bowed to Rama and said, "We will help you whenever you need us!"

Rama said, "Thank you. Help me when I call you."  Then they went back to their homes.

Rama looked around. "What's that dark cloud near the mountain, Sage?" he asked.  It looked like a beautiful forest, with lots of deer and singing birds.  "Is this the scary forest we had to cross?"

The sage smiled.  "No, Rama. We're safe now. This is my home. But evil demons try to stop me from praying.  They kill good people!  I would be grateful for your help.”

Rama said, "Don't worry! I will protect you and fight those bad demons!"
