Bharata went to see his mother, Kaikeyi.  He hadn't seen her in a long time!  Kaikeyi was so happy to see him.  She hugged him and asked him about his grandfather and uncle.  Bharata told her about his trip. He said his journey was long, but everyone was well.

Bharata noticed something was wrong.  The palace wasn't as bright as usual.  He asked his mother where his father, the king, was.  Kaikeyi had sad news.  She told Bharata that his father had died.

Bharata was very upset. He cried and cried. He couldn't believe his father was gone. He said the palace felt empty without him.

Kaikeyi comforted him. She told him that good people don't stay sad for too long.  She then explained that his father, before he died, had sent his older brother, Rama, to live in the forest.  

Bharata was shocked! He asked why Rama was sent away. Kaikeyi finally told him the truth:  She had asked the king to make Bharata king, and send Rama away.  The king, to keep his promise to Kaikeyi, sent Rama away, and then died of sadness.  Now, Kaikeyi said, Bharata should be king.

Bharata was still very sad.  He wanted to find Rama and apologize. He wanted to be with his brother, who he loved very much. He decided to go find Rama in the forest.
