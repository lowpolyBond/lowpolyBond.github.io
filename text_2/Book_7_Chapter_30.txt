Once upon a time, Ravana's amazing son, Indrajit, won a big battle against the powerful god Indra!  The other gods were worried. They went to Ravana and asked him nicely to let Indra go.

They said, "Ravana, your son is so brave! He's almost as strong as you!  Please let Indra go.  We'll give you anything you want!"

Indrajit said, "Okay, I'll let Indra go, but I want something special â€“ immortality!"

The gods said, "No one can be immortal, not even the strongest being!"

Indrajit thought for a moment.  He loved to fight! He said, "Then I want a special chariot!  If I'm in that chariot, and I've done my prayers, nothing can hurt me. But if I forget my prayers, then I can die."

The gods agreed.  Indrajit let Indra go, and everyone went home.

Poor Indra was sad.  He felt terrible. Another god, Brahma, saw him and said, "Indra, you did something bad a long time ago.  You were very mean to a nice woman named Ahalya."

Brahma explained that Indra had been very naughty and a wise man cursed him for it.  Because of this curse, Indra lost the battle to Indrajit.

Brahma told Indra to pray to Vishnu, a very good god.  Indra did this, and everything was okay again! He went back to heaven.

Later, Rama and his friends heard this story. They were amazed at how strong Indrajit was!  Bibishana, a friend of Rama, said, "Yes, I remember that! I saw it happen!"  Rama said, "That's an incredible story!"  And that's how Indrajit became so famous.
