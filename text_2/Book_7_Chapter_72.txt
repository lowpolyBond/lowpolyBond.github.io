Prince Shatrughna couldn't sleep! He was thinking about Rama, the amazing hero.  He listened to beautiful music all night.

In the morning, he bowed to a wise holy man.  "I want to see Rama!" he said.  "May I leave?"

The holy man smiled and said, "Yes, go see your brother!"

Shatrughna jumped in his chariot.  He was so excited to see Rama!  He zoomed to Ayodhya, Rama's city.

Ayodhya was beautiful!  Shatrughna found Rama.  Rama was sitting with his friends, shining like the moon.

Shatrughna bowed low.  "I did everything you asked," he said. "I defeated Lavana!  But I've missed you for twelve years!  Please let me come home!"

Rama hugged him. "Don't be sad," Rama said. "Kings can't leave their kingdoms.  But come visit me often! Stay here for seven days, then go back to your own city."

Shatrughna was a little sad, but he said, "Okay."

He stayed with Rama for a week. Then, he said goodbye to Rama, Bharata, and Lakshmana.  Lakshmana and Bharata walked with him a long way as he went back home in his chariot.
