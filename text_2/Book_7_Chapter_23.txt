Once upon a time, the ten-headed demon king Ravana, a super strong warrior, fought a powerful god named Yama and won!  His friends were amazed to see him all bloody and hurt, but he said, "Don't worry, I won!"  They all hopped into his magic flying chariot, the Pushpaka.

Ravana zoomed down to the underwater city of the Nagas (snake people). He beat them too!  Then, he flew to another city, made of sparkly jewels, where strong giants lived.  He challenged them to a fight!  The giants fought Ravana for a whole year! Neither side could win.

Then, a really, really old and powerful god appeared. He told everyone, "Ravana can't be beaten by anyone!  You giants can't be beaten either! Why don't you become friends?"

So, Ravana and the giants became friends.  He stayed with them for a year, learning magic tricks.

Then Ravana went on an adventure to find the ocean king's city. He fought lots of soldiers and even killed his brother-in-law! Then, he saw a magical cow, Surabha, that gave endless milk!  He wanted to get to the ocean king's palace, but the king's army stopped him. Ravana fought them, and his friends easily beat the ocean king's army.  They sent a message to the ocean king: "Ravana is here! Fight him if you dare!"

Later, Ravana found a beautiful palace.  He sent his friend Prahasta to see who lived there. Prahasta found a scary man sitting in a fire!  The man was powerful and looked like the god of death.

Ravana wanted to fight this man, but he was scared! The man said, "I'm Bali, a super strong giant!  Want to fight?"

Bali told Ravana about an even more powerful god, Vishnu, who had defeated many powerful giants.  Bali showed Ravana a giant, magical disc.  Ravana tried to lift it, but he couldn't! He fell down, knocked out!

Bali explained that Vishnu was stronger than anyone.  He was everywhere, all the time.  Ravana, embarrassed, left.


Ravana flew to the sun and challenged him to a fight.  The sun's guards told Ravana, "The sun says, 'You win!'" So Ravana said he won and went away.

Next, he met the moon, who was busy partying with beautiful creatures.  A wise man told Ravana that the moon was celebrating a victory, and wasn't looking for a fight.  Then, the wise man told Ravana about another powerful king, Mandhata.

Ravana challenged Mandhata to a fight. They fought a super amazing battle.  They used magical weapons.  It was a really, really close fight. It was so powerful, that everyone got scared. But two wise men stopped them.  They became friends.

Ravana then went up, up, up to the sky. He flew past amazing places with swans and other magical creatures. He even visited the moon! But the moon's cold light was hurting him and his friends.  Another really old god, Brahma, told him to leave. Brahma gave Ravana a special magic chant that would help him from now on.

After that, Ravana went to a faraway island and found an incredibly powerful, giant being. They fought, but this being was way too strong. Ravana was defeated!  This being was Kapila. The giant being also showed Ravana a vision of the universe inside his body.  Ravana was surprised and went back to his friends.  The powerful being let Ravana live.

So, Ravana went on many adventures. He fought many strong warriors and gods, but in the end, he learned that there were others even more powerful than him!
