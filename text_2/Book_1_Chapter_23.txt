One morning, before the sun came up, a wise man named Vishvamitra woke Prince Rama.  "Rama," he said, "it's time to pray!"

Rama and his brother Lakshmana got up. They washed, prayed to the sun, and said special prayers.  Then they bowed to Vishvamitra and were ready to go.

They walked with Vishvamitra to where two rivers met.  There was a peaceful place with holy people who prayed a lot.

Rama and Lakshmana were happy.  "Wise man," they asked, "who lives here?"

Vishvamitra smiled. "Long ago," he said, "a man named Kama lived here. He tried to make Lord Shiva angry. Shiva was very upset and Kama turned to ash! Now he's called Ananga, which means 'without a body'.  This place belongs to Lord Shiva, and these holy people worship him."

"Tonight, we'll stay here," Vishvamitra said. "Tomorrow, we'll cross the river."  They all cleaned themselves, prayed, and then stayed in the holy place.

The holy people knew they were coming. They were so happy to welcome Vishvamitra, Rama, and Lakshmana.  They shared stories and talked about important things until bedtime.  Rama and Lakshmana had a wonderful night at Kama's old home.
