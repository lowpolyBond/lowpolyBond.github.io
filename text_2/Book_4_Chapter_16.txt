King Bali's beautiful wife, Tara, was worried.  Her husband, Bali, was about to fight his brother, Sugriva.  Bali told Tara not to worry.

"Sugriva is being rude," Bali said. "A brave monkey doesn't ignore insults! I'll teach him a lesson, but I won't kill him. He'll run away when he sees how strong I am!"

Tara hugged Bali tightly, said goodbye, and went back home.  She was very sad.

Bali was very angry! He stormed out of the city, like a big snake hissing. He wanted to find Sugriva and fight.

He found Sugriva, dressed in shiny armor, looking proud.  Bali got ready to fight.  "I'll knock you down with one punch!" he shouted.

Sugriva yelled back, "I'll smash your head!"  They started fighting!  They punched and kicked, and tore up trees to use as weapons.  It was a huge, messy fight!

Sugriva was getting tired. He was weaker than Bali.  He secretly asked for help.  Rama, a very strong and good man, saw Sugriva was losing.

Rama shot an arrow.  It flew like lightning!  The arrow hit Bali, and the strong king fell down. He was hurt very badly.

Bali was defeated. Rama's arrow was so powerful, it was like the end of the world! Bali fell to the ground, like a flag falling down.  The fight was over.
