Once upon a time, a mighty army of monkeys and bears gathered to fight a wicked king!  A wise monkey showed a brave warrior the amazing army.

First, there was Hanuman!  His huge tail was many colors – copper, yellow, black, and white! It was so long it almost touched the ground as he walked. Behind him marched thousands of other monkeys, ready to fight! They were all loyal to their king and ready for battle.

Next came the bears! So many, you couldn't count them all – like the sand on the beach!  They were big and strong, like dark clouds covering the land. Their leader, Dhumra, was very scary, but his younger brother, Jambavan, was even braver! Jambavan was super smart and had helped the gods win a big battle long ago.  The bears threw giant rocks like the gods themselves!

Then there was Rambha, a brave monkey leader who lived on a tall mountain.  He could jump really high, then stand still as a statue.  Samnadana, the grandpa of the monkeys, was so big, his body touched two faraway mountains! He was even stronger than the god Indra!

Another great monkey leader was Krathana. He was strong and never gave up.  He sat under a special tree, ready to attack!

Pramathin, another brave monkey, lived near a big river. He was as strong as the god Indra. He roared like thunder and made the ground shake! Thousands of monkeys followed him, ready to fight!

The Golangulas, a huge group of monkeys, were ready too! Their leader was Gavaksha.  They had helped build a bridge and were now ready to tear down the enemy's kingdom!

Kesharin lived on a shining mountain full of delicious fruit and honey.  He was ready to fight!

On a mountain of gold lived Shatabali and his monkey army. They were strong and brave, with teeth and claws like lions!  They were as scary as thunder!  They were ready to fight too!

Many other monkey leaders were there – Gaja, Gavaksha, Gavaya, Nala, and Nila, each with many, many soldiers! They were all as strong as mountains. They could even destroy mountains! All these amazing monkeys and bears were ready to fight for their friend, Rama!
