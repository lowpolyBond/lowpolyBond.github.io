Rama and Lakshmana were listening to a wise old man, Vishvamitra.  He told them amazing stories!  After one story, the princes asked about Ganga, the river that flows from the sky to the earth.  They wanted to know all about her.

Vishvamitra smiled.  He told them about Lord Shiva and his wife, Parvati.  They were gods, very powerful! They wanted a child, but for a long time, they didn't have one.

The other gods were worried.  They thought a child of Shiva and Parvati would be super strong and maybe even too powerful! So, they asked Shiva to do special exercises to keep his power inside.

Shiva agreed.  But he asked, "If my power gets too strong, what will happen to it?"

The other gods said, "Let it flow onto the earth."

So, Shiva's power flowed down, making a bright white mountain and a beautiful forest.  From this, a strong baby boy, Kartikeya, was born!

Everyone was happy, except Parvati.  She was angry because the other gods had stopped her from having a baby. She was very upset and cursed them, saying they wouldn't have children.  She even cursed the earth!

After that, Shiva and Parvati went to a high mountain in the Himalayas.  That's where Ganga, the other daughter of the Himalayas was born.  And that's how the great river Ganga came to be! Vishvamitra finished the story. Now, he would tell them about Ganga.
