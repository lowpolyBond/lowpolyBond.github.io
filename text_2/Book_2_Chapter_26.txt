Rama, a very good prince, was about to go into the forest. He said goodbye to his mother and walked through the busy streets. Everyone felt calm when they saw him.

Sita, Rama's wife, was very happy. She thought they were getting ready for a big party, a coronation!  She was praying to the gods and getting ready to see her husband.

Rama went to the palace.  It was full of people dressed in beautiful clothes. But Rama was dressed simply.

Sita was surprised!  She saw Rama looked sad and worried.  "Rama," she asked, "Why aren't you wearing your special crown? Where are the musicians? Why aren't the special elephants here?"  The coronation was supposed to happen today!

Rama explained, "My father made me promise to live in the forest for fourteen years.  My stepmother, Kaikeyi, asked for this as a gift.  I have to go now, Sita.  Please be good to my brother Bharata. He will be the king now.  Be kind to my mother and my other brothers."

Rama told Sita to be respectful to everyone, especially Bharata.  He said to dress simply, just like him, and to take care of his family. Then, with a sad heart, Rama went to the forest.  Sita was very upset, but she promised to do everything Rama asked.
