Long ago, Lord Vishnu, a very powerful god, decided to help everyone.  He became the son of King Dasaratha!  To help him, other gods changed into amazing monkeys!

Brahma, the creator god, told the other gods, “Become strong, magic-using monkeys! Be brave, smart, and as strong as Lord Vishnu!”  Some gods even became monkey moms and dads!

Indra, the king of the gods, made Bali a monkey.  The sun god made Sugriva. Other gods made lots of other strong monkey heroes like Nala, Nila, and Hanuman, who was super fast and strong, like a diamond eagle!

Thousands of amazing monkeys were born!  They were strong and brave, like their godly parents. They could climb mountains, break rocks, and even make the ocean splash!  They were super-duper strong!

Two monkey brothers, Sugriva and Bali, became the leaders of all the monkeys.  Hanuman, Nala, and Nila led groups of monkeys, too.  These monkeys were so strong, they could even fight lions and tigers!

Bali, the strongest of all, kept everyone safe. All these amazing monkeys were ready to help Lord Rama – they were ready for an adventure!
