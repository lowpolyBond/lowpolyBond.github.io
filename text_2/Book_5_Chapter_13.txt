Hanuman, the brave monkey, zoomed down from the sky like a flash of lightning! He'd searched and searched Ravana's palace for Sita, but she wasn't there.  He felt worried.

"I've looked everywhere!" he thought. "I've searched swamps, lakes, rivers, forests, and even the highest mountains!  Sampati, the vulture king, said Sita was in Ravana's palace, but she's not!  Did Ravana hurt her? Did she fall into the ocean? Did she die of sadness? I don't know!"

Hanuman was very scared. He thought, "If I go back to Rama without Sita, what will I say? Rama will be heartbroken!  Lakshmana, Bharata, and Shatrughna will be so sad they might die!  Sugriva and all the monkeys will be very upset too! Everyone will be so sad, they might all die!"

He thought, "Maybe I should just die myself! I could jump off a cliff or starve in the forest.  But then, if I'm alive, maybe I can still find Sita!"

Hanuman was so brave! He decided, "I will find Sita! I will defeat the terrible Ravana, or I will bring him to Rama!"

He spotted a big, beautiful Ashoka tree grove. "Maybe Sita is here," he thought.  He asked the gods for help and made himself tiny so Ravana wouldn't see him.

"Oh, when will I see Sita's beautiful face?" he wondered. "How will I find her in this huge palace?"

Hanuman knew he had to keep looking. He wouldn't give up until he found Sita and brought her back to Rama.
