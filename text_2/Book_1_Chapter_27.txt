Once upon a time, Prince Rama slept in the forest with the wise Vishvamitra.  In the morning, Vishvamitra smiled and said, "Rama, you're amazing! I want to give you some super-powerful weapons!"

He gave Rama lots of amazing weapons! There was a shining disc, a special spear, a magic mace, and many more.  Some weapons could make enemies very sleepy, others could make them very sad, and some were so strong they could defeat anyone!  He even gave Rama weapons that could control the wind and summon fire!

Vishvamitra gave Rama so many weapons that it took a long time to list them all:  a powerful club, a sharp sword, a magical arrow, and even a weapon that made people fall in love!

Vishvamitra then taught Rama secret magic words to use the weapons.  Amazingly, when Rama said the magic words, the spirits of the weapons appeared!  They bowed down and promised to obey Rama.

Rama thanked Vishvamitra, and then said, "Let's go on our adventure!"  And so they continued their journey.
