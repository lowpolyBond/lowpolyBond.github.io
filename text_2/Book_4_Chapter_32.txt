King Sugriva was worried.  Lakshmana, Rama's brother, was angry! Angada and the other monkeys had told him about it.

Sugriva said, "I didn't do anything wrong!  Maybe someone is trying to trick Lakshmana and make him angry at me." He asked his wise helpers, "Why is Lakshmana mad?  I'm not afraid of Rama or Lakshmana, but it's important to keep our friends happy.  Rama has helped me so much, and I feel bad that I haven't helped him enough in return."

Hanuman, the strong monkey, spoke up. "King Sugriva, Rama saved you! He fought a scary monster for you. Now, Rama is sad because his wife, Sita, is missing.  He sent Lakshmana to remind you to start searching for her."

Hanuman explained, "It's like autumn has arrived – the trees are blooming, the sky is clear – but you're too busy having fun to notice! Lakshmana came because you forgot to start looking for Sita. Rama is very upset, so Lakshmana might sound angry.  You should apologize to Lakshmana."

Hanuman continued, "It's important to always be truthful and helpful to your king.  Rama is incredibly strong.  It's better to apologize than to make him angrier.  Remember how much he's done for you?  Bow down to Lakshmana and promise to help find Sita. Please, don't upset Rama. He's as strong as all the gods!"

So, Sugriva listened to Hanuman's advice. He decided to apologize to Lakshmana and start looking for Sita right away.
