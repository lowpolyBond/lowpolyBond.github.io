King Dasaratha wanted a son, so he asked a very wise man named Rishyasringa for help.  Rishyasringa knew a special magic ritual! He performed a big fire ceremony with chants and prayers.

Lots of magical beings came – like beautiful singing creatures called gandharvas and powerful beings called siddhas.  After the ceremony, they all went to see the great god Brahma.

They were very upset!  A powerful demon named Ravana was being mean to everyone. He was bullying everyone, even the gods!  He was super strong and even controlled the sun and wind!  They begged Brahma to help them get rid of Ravana.

Brahma said, "I have a plan! Ravana is invincible to gods and magical beings, but he forgot to ask to be protected from humans. Only a human can defeat him!"

Everyone was happy!  Then, a very important god named Vishnu appeared.  He was very handsome and strong, carrying a shiny disc and a big club.

The gods asked Vishnu to be reborn as King Dasaratha’s son. They pleaded, "Please, Lord Vishnu, be reborn as a human to defeat Ravana!"  They were scared of the demon and his cruelty.

Vishnu agreed. He said, "Don't worry! I will defeat Ravana and his whole army. I will be born as four sons of King Dasaratha and rule the earth for a very long time."

The gods were overjoyed!  Everyone sang praises to Vishnu, begging him to get rid of the awful Ravana and bring peace back to the world.  Vishnu decided to become four princes, born to King Dasaratha, and so the story begins!
