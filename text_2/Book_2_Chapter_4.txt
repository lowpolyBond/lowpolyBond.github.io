King Dasaratha was a very old king. He loved his son, Rama, very much. He decided that Rama should be the next king.  He told his advisors, "Tomorrow, Rama will be crowned!"

The king sent for Rama.  Rama was surprised! He went to see his father.  The king hugged Rama and said, "My son, I'm old. You are a good and kind prince. You will be a great king. Tomorrow, you will become the king."

But the king was worried. He had some bad dreams. He told Rama, "Some stars say bad things might happen.  Let's have your coronation tomorrow, before anything bad happens."

The king told Rama to fast with his wife, Sita, that night.  Rama was happy. He went to tell Sita the good news.

He found Sita with his mother, Queen Kaushalya, and his brother, Lakshmana.  Everyone was excited! Queen Kaushalya cried happy tears. She had always wanted Rama to be king.

Rama told Lakshmana, "You are my best friend. We will rule the kingdom together."

Rama and Sita went home, ready to become the king and queen! They were very happy and excited for the next day.
