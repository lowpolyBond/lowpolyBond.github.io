Once upon a time, a powerful demon king named Ravana was traveling. He saw a beautiful young woman in the forest. She was a princess named Vedavati.  She wasn't wearing fancy clothes; she wore simple clothes and lived a quiet life, praying and being kind.

Ravana was amazed by her beauty. He asked her, "Why are you living like this? You're so pretty! Who is your husband?  Tell me everything!"

Vedavati told him her story.  "My father was a very wise and holy man," she said. "He wanted me to marry the great god Vishnu.  But a bad king, Shumbhu, killed my father.  My mother was so sad she died too. Now, I'm praying to Vishnu to fulfill my father's wish."

Ravana, who was very proud and powerful, laughed. "You want to marry Vishnu? He's nothing compared to me!  I'm the king of Lanka! Be my wife!"

Vedavati refused.  She said, "How could I ever marry anyone else but the great god Vishnu?"

Ravana was angry. He grabbed Vedavati's hair. Vedavati, very brave, used magic to turn her hand into a sword! She cut off her hair.  She was so mad, she created a big fire and jumped into it!

As she burned, beautiful flowers rained down.  This wasn't the end. Vedavati was reborn as a princess.  She was destined to marry Vishnu and help defeat the evil Ravana.  She would one day be reborn and help defeat the evil Ravana! This was her promise.  And that is how Vedavatiâ€™s story began.
