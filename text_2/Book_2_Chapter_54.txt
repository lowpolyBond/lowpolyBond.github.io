One sunny morning, after sleeping under a big banyan tree, Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita started walking.  They were going to where two big rivers, the Ganga and the Yamuna, meet.

The forest was beautiful!  Rama and Lakshmana saw amazing sights they'd never seen before.  They rested under pretty flowering trees.

As the sun began to set, Rama said, "Lakshmana, look!  Smoke is rising, like a giant flag!  That means we're near the home of a wise holy man, Bharadvaja!"

They heard the rivers rushing together.  They saw wood cutters working.  Soon, they reached Bharadvaja's home.  They stopped a little way away, to be respectful.

Rama went to see the wise man.  Bharadvaja was sitting with his students, praying. Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana bowed down.

Rama told Bharadvaja, "We are Rama and Lakshmana, sons of King Dasaratha.  This is my wife, Sita.  My father sent me to live in the forest, and Lakshmana came with me."

Bharadvaja welcomed them warmly. He gave them food and a place to sleep. He asked them how they were.  Bharadvaja said, "Rama, stay here! This is a peaceful place."

But Rama said, "Many people will come to see Sita and me. We need a quieter place."

Bharadvaja said, "Ten miles away is Cittrakuta mountain. Many holy people live there.  It's beautiful! Monkeys, bears, and even chimpanzees live there!"

Rama thought Cittrakuta sounded perfect.  Bharadvaja was very kind. He gave Rama and his family a good meal and a comfortable place to sleep.

The next morning, Rama thanked Bharadvaja.  They said goodbye.

Bharadvaja told them, "Cittrakuta is full of yummy fruits and honey!  Peacocks call, and elephants roam free.  It's a wonderful place to live!"

Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita were excited to go to Cittrakuta Mountain. They knew it would be a peaceful and happy place to live during their time in the forest.
