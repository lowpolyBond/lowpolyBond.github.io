Once upon a time, there was a very powerful wise man named Vishvamitra. He wanted to become a super-wise brahmarishi!  So, he went to a quiet place and sat still for a whole thousand years! He didn't talk, he didn't eat much, and he just thought very, very hard.

After a thousand years, he looked like a tree! But he was still not angry, even when people tried to bother him. Finally, he ate his first meal.  A trickster god, Indra, disguised as a poor man, asked for all his food. Vishvamitra gave it away, still not saying a word!

Vishvamitra kept practicing his super-hard thinking for another thousand years!  A smoky cloud came out of his head!  It scared everyone in the whole world!  The gods and goddesses were so scared they went to the great god Brahma for help!

They said, "Lord Brahma, Vishvamitra is so powerful, he might destroy the world! Please help him become a brahmarishi so he'll stop!"

Brahma went to Vishvamitra and said, "You've done an amazing job! You're a brahmarishi now!" Brahma also gave Vishvamitra special powers and magic words.

Vishvamitra wanted another wise man, Vasishtha, to agree that he was truly super-wise. The gods asked Vasishtha, and he said yes!

Vishvamitra was very happy. He helped people and did good deeds all over the land.

King Janaka was so happy to meet Vishvamitra and Rama and Lakshmana.  He heard the story of Vishvamitra's amazing journey.  It was getting late, so the King said goodnight and went home.

Vishvamitra, Rama, and Lakshmana went home too.  That's the story of how Vishvamitra became a super-wise brahmarishi!
