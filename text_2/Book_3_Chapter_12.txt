Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana went to a wise hermit's home in the forest.  Lakshmana, Rama's brother, talked to the hermit's student.  He said, "Rama, the prince, and Sita are here to see the wise hermit.  We came because our father, the king, told us to."

The student went to tell the wise hermit, Agastya.  Agastya was so happy! He said, "Wonderful! Bring Rama and Sita to me!"

The student found Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana. He said, "The hermit wants to see you!"  They went inside.  The hermit's home was full of friendly deer.  There were special places for praying to many gods.

Rama saw the wise hermit and bowed down. He was very respectful. Agastya was happy to see Rama.  He gave Rama a warm welcome.  He gave Rama food and a special seat.

Agastya said, "Itâ€™s an honor to have you here, Rama!  A wise hermit always welcomes guests."

Then Agastya gave Rama amazing gifts!  He gave him a powerful bow and arrows, a special dart, and a strong sword. These were gifts from the gods!  They were very special and powerful weapons.  

Agastya told Rama, "This bow and these weapons belonged to the mighty god Vishnu.  They will help you win any battle!"
