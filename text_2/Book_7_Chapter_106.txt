Rama looked sad and heartbroken.  His brother Lakshmana saw this and said, "Don't be sad because of me, Rama!  I should die to keep your promise.  It's important to always keep your word!"

Rama was very upset. He called his wise advisors and priests. He told them about the angry magic man, Durvasa, and the promise he made.  The advisors were quiet, but the wisest one, Vasishtha, said, "Rama, losing Lakshmana is terrible, but you must keep your promise.  If you don't, the whole world will be in danger!"

Everyone agreed. Rama sadly told Lakshmana, "To keep the world safe, I must send you away."

Lakshmana was very sad, but he left. He went to the Sarayu River and prayed. As he sat there peacefully, the gods showered him with flowers!  Suddenly, Lakshmana disappeared!  The powerful god Indra took him up to heaven! The gods were so happy to see him.  They knew Lakshmana was a part of the great god Vishnu!
