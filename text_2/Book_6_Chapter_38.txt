Rama and his brother Lakshmana were going to fight the bad king Ravana, who had stolen Rama's wife, Sita.  They asked their monkey friends, Sugriva and Bibishana, to come along.

"Let's climb Mount Suvela," Rama said.  "It's a big mountain, and from the top, we can see Ravana's island, Lanka!"  Rama was very angry because Ravana was mean and unfair.

So they all climbed the mountain.  Lakshmana carried his bow and arrows.  The monkeys were super fast, like the wind! They quickly reached the top.

From the mountain, they could see Lanka!  It was a beautiful city with tall walls and shiny gates. But there were lots of Ravana's dark soldiers guarding it.  The monkeys were ready to fight! They all shouted excitedly.

The sun started to set, and the moon came out.  Rama, Sugriva, Lakshmana, and Bibishana all rested on the mountain.  They were ready to rescue Sita!
