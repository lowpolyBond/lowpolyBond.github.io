Rama and Sugriva, the monkey king, became friends.  Sugriva wanted Rama's help to defeat his mean brother, Bali. To show how strong he was, Rama picked up his bow and arrow.  *Whoosh!*  The arrow flew so fast, it went through seven big trees, then into a mountain, and into the ground!  It zipped back to Rama in a flash!

Sugriva's eyes went wide! He was amazed.  He bowed down to Rama and begged for help. He said, "You're so strong, you could defeat anyone! Please help me!"

Rama smiled and said, "Let's go to Kishkindha, Bali's city. You challenge Bali first."

They snuck into the woods near Kishkindha. Sugriva roared a loud challenge to Bali.  Bali, hearing the roar, got super angry. He stormed out ready to fight.

The brothers fought!  It was a huge, noisy battle!  Rama watched, but he couldn't tell Sugriva from Bali. They looked so much alike!  He didn't want to shoot his arrow and accidentally hit Sugriva.

Bali beat up Sugriva, who ran away to hide.  Bali didn't follow.

Rama found Sugriva, who was sad and upset.  Sugriva asked, "Why didn't you help me?"

Rama explained, "You and Bali looked exactly the same! I couldn't tell you apart. I didn't want to hurt you by accident."

Rama had a plan. He asked Lakshmana to put pretty white flowers around Sugriva's neck. Now Rama would know who was who!

Sugriva felt much better. With Rama and Lakshmana by his side, Sugriva went back to fight Bali.  This time, Rama would help his friend!
