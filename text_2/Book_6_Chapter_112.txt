Bibishana saw his brother, Ravana, lying dead on the battlefield.  He was very sad.  He cried, "Oh, brave warrior! You were so strong and skilled!  How could this happen?  You, who always slept on a soft bed, now lie still on the hard ground!  My warnings went unheeded!  Prahasta, Indrajit, Kumbhakarna, and so many othersâ€¦all gone! The strongest among us are now gone!  It's like the sun has disappeared, and the world is dark!"

Rama, hearing Bibishana's sadness, said, "Don't cry. Ravana fought bravely, even though he lost.  Warriors sometimes die in battle. It's not a shame.  We shouldn't mourn for him.  Victory doesn't always go to one side.  Sometimes the strong are defeated.  This is the way of warriors."

Bibishana was still very sad.  He said, "Ravana was a great king. He was generous and powerful. He worshipped the gods and lived a good life.  May I give him a proper burial?"

Rama nodded.  "Yes," he said. "Our fight is over.  He was your brother, and now he is at peace. Let us give him a proper funeral, and send his soul to heaven."  Rama and Bibishana, though once enemies, together performed Ravana's funeral.
