King Janaka said some kind words.  Then, the wise Vishvamitra, who was there with Vasishtha, spoke.  He said, "King Janaka, the families of Rama and your family are both very important and wonderful! Rama and Sita are a perfect couple, just like Lakshmana and Urmila.  King Janaka, I have a request. Your brother, King Kushadvaja, has two beautiful daughters. I'd like them to marry Bharata and Shatrughna, Rama's brothers.  Dasaratha's four sons are handsome and strong, like gods! Please let your daughters marry them."

King Janaka was happy. He bowed to Vishvamitra and Vasishtha and said, "I'm honored by your request. My brother's daughters will marry Bharata and Shatrughna. All four princes will marry on the same day! Tomorrow is a lucky day."

Vasishtha agreed. King Janaka said, "It's your kindness that allows me to marry off my daughters.  My kingdom is now like part of King Dasaratha's kingdom. I speak the truth!"

King Dasaratha was very happy! He said, "My dear brothers, you have been very kind. May you be happy!  Excuse me, I need to get ready for the weddings."

King Dasaratha left. The next day, he gave away many, many cows as gifts.  He gave thousands of cows with golden horns to the priests, one set for each of his sons.  Each cow had a special golden bucket for its milk. He gave away four hundred thousand cows! He was very generous, like a god giving gifts.
