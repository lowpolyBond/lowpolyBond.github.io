Rama and Sita were living happily in the forest of Citrakuta.  One day, Rama noticed something was wrong. The holy men who lived there looked scared. They whispered to each other and looked worried.

Rama asked them, "What's wrong? Did I do something to upset you? Did my brother Lakshmana hurt you? Did Sita do anything wrong?"

A very old, thin holy man said, "No, Sita is wonderful.  It's the demons! They hate you, Rama!  They're hurting us."

He explained that Ravana's brother, Kara, was a mean, strong demon.  He was chasing the holy men away from their homes!  The demons were scaring them, throwing dirty things into their sacred places, and even killing some of them! They were ruining their ceremonies and putting out their sacred fires.

"Rama," the old man said, "The demons are too scary! We're going to a safer place called Tapovana.  You should come with us, because they want to hurt you too."

Rama wanted the holy men to stay, but they were too afraid. He walked with them a little way, then said goodbye.  Even though most of the holy men left, a few stayed with Rama because they trusted him. Rama stayed in his hermitage, even though it was dangerous.
