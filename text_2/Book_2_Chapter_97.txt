Rama and Lakshmana were in the forest.  Lakshmana was very angry! He wanted to fight!  Rama said, "Lakshmana, our brother Bharata is coming. He's coming to see us."

Rama explained, "Why would I fight my brother?  I would never take a kingdom by hurting my family. It would be like eating poisoned food! I only want the kingdom to help my brothers."  He touched his arms and said, "I promise, I only want to help Bharata and Shatrughna."

Rama said, "Maybe Bharata is sad because we left. Maybe he's upset with Mother. He's not here to fight. He's our brother!" Rama said Lakshmana was being mean to Bharata, just like he was being mean to Rama!  "How can brothers fight each other?" he asked. "If you want the kingdom, I'll ask Bharata to give it to you!"

Lakshmana felt very bad.  He was ashamed.  He said, "It sounds like Father is here!"

Rama said, "Yes! Maybe Father came to take us home! And maybe he wants to take Sita home too!"

Then they saw horses and elephants! A big army was coming.  Rama said, "It's Bharata's army! But I don't see Father's special umbrella. Let's go down from the tree, Lakshmana."

Lakshmana climbed down. Bharata told his soldiers to stay away from Rama's home.  His huge army stayed far away, showing respect for Rama. Bharata was a good and kind brother.
