Long ago, Rama, there was a huge, empty place, like a giant desert.  It was so big, you couldn't see the end of it! No animals or birds lived there.  A wise man went to live there all alone.  He found a beautiful place with yummy fruits and special trees.

In the middle was a big lake, full of pretty swans and birds.  The lake was covered with lovely flowers, and the water was super clear.  The wise man found a quiet place to stay near the lake.

One morning, he saw something strange in the lake: a shiny, beautiful body floating in the water.  He wondered, "What is that?"

Suddenly, a sparkly chariot pulled by super-fast swans zoomed into view!  A very handsome man was inside, with lots of beautiful dancing ladies. They sang and played music. The ladies even fanned the handsome man with pretty fans.

The man got out of the chariot and, surprise!, he ate the body in the lake! Then he cleaned himself and went back into his chariot.

The wise man was amazed! He asked the handsome man, "Who are you? Why did you eat that body?  That's not right!"

The handsome man smiled. He was a special being from the sky, and he told the wise man a secret story about why he ate the body.  The wise man was very interested to hear what it was!
