Hanuman, the monkey, saw Lanka burning.  The city was filled with smoke and scared giants. He felt very sad and worried.

He thought, "I burned down Lanka!  That was wrong!  Anger is bad.  It makes people do terrible things.  I might have hurt Sita!  If Sita is dead, I've failed Rama!"

Hanuman felt terrible.  He thought he should die. He wanted to jump into the fire or the ocean.  He felt ashamed to see Rama and his friends again. He thought he had made the whole world sad.

But then, Hanuman remembered some good things. He thought, "Maybe Sita is okay! Fire can't hurt someone so good and pure. Rama's power protected me, maybe it protected Sita too!"

He also remembered a magical mountain he saw in the ocean. It helped him, and maybe Sita's goodness helped her too.

Then, Hanuman heard some angels talking. They said, "Lanka is burning, but Sita is still alive!  It's a miracle!"

Hanuman was so happy! He knew Sita was safe.  He was relieved. He decided to see Sita one last time before leaving Lanka.
