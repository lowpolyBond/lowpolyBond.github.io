Lakshmana, a brave warrior, went to the monkey city of Kishkindha.  Angada had asked him to go, and Rama had told him to.

The big, strong monkeys guarding the city gates saw Lakshmana coming. They bowed low. They were scared of the angry warrior!

Kishkindha was a beautiful city! It sparkled with jewels and flowers.  Pretty temples and big houses were everywhere.  Monkeys, who could even change shape, lived there.  They wore fancy clothes and necklaces.

The city smelled wonderful!  It smelled of sweet flowers and special woods.  Lakshmana saw amazing homes, taller than the biggest mountains!  He even saw the homes of famous monkeys like Hanuman and Jambavan.  They were like sparkling white clouds!

Sugriva, the monkey king's palace, was on a high white rock. It looked like a palace in the sky!  The palace gates were made of gold and were guarded by strong monkeys with weapons.

Lakshmana went inside easily.  He walked through many courtyards and then saw Sugriva’s private rooms. They were filled with gold, silver, and beautiful women making flower garlands.  They were singing and playing music.  Everyone was happy and dressed in fancy clothes.

Lakshmana heard the jingling of the women’s jewelry.  He felt uncomfortable. He was very upset because he was there to help Rama, and he felt Sugriva wasn't taking it seriously enough. He pulled his bowstring, making a loud *twang!*

Sugriva, the monkey king, heard the bow. He was very afraid! He knew Angada had told him Lakshmana was coming.

Sugriva was worried. He asked his wife, Tara, "Why is Rama's brother so angry? Do you know why?"

Tara, Sugriva's beautiful wife, went to Lakshmana.  She was a little tipsy from drinking wine. She asked him kindly, "Why are you so angry, sir? What's wrong?"

Lakshmana explained.  He said Sugriva was having too much fun and had forgotten about helping Rama. He said Sugriva should be working, not partying.  He said Sugriva needed to remember his promise.

Tara understood. She said, "Please forgive Sugriva.  He’s a good monkey at heart, but he’s been enjoying himself too much. He’s already prepared many monkeys to help you!"

Tara invited Lakshmana inside.  There, Sugriva was sitting on his golden throne. He looked beautiful and majestic, surrounded by his wives.  He was happy to finally see Lakshmana and ready to do what he had promised.
