Ravana, a mean king, spoke very harshly to Sita.  Sita was scared, like a baby elephant seeing a big lion.

Ravana and his friends surrounded Sita. She felt very sad and alone, like a little girl lost in the woods.

Sita thought, "Wise people say we die when it's our time.  I'm still alive, even though I'm so unhappy.  My heart feels like it will break into a million pieces!  It's not my fault.  Ravana might kill me, but I'll never love him.  If Rama doesn't come soon, Ravana will hurt me badly.  Two months will pass quickly, and then I'll die.  It will be like a thief being punished."

Sita cried, "Rama! Lakshmana!  My mother!  I'm going to die!  Maybe Rama and Lakshmana are hurt.  That trick deer fooled me!  I sent them to catch it, and nowâ€¦ Oh, Rama, my wonderful Rama, you don't know I'm in danger! All my good deeds mean nothing if you're not here!  When you come back, you'll be happy with other princesses. But I, who loved you so much, will be gone. I wish I could kill myself, but I can't."

Sita was so sad she started to untie her hair. She wanted to hang herself.

Then, Sita looked at a tree branch. She thought of Rama, Lakshmana, and her family.  Suddenly, she felt a little better.  Good things seemed to be coming her way!
