Bharata was very sad.  His brother Rama had been sent away. Bharata brought his mothers home to Ayodhya.  He then talked to his wise teacher, Vasishtha, and the other elders.

"I want to go to Nandigrama," Bharata said. "I'll stay there and be sad because Rama is gone. Rama is the real king. I will wait for him to come back."

Vasishtha and the elders said, "Bharata, that's a good thing to do.  You love your brother very much."

Bharata told his driver, Sumantra, "Get the chariot!"  He, and his brother Shatrughna, got in.  Many people followed them to Nandigrama.  Bharata carried Rama's sandals on his head.  He loved his brother so much!

In Nandigrama, Bharata said, "Rama gave me the kingdom to look after.  These sandals will stand for him!" He put the sandals on the king's throne under a beautiful canopy.

Bharata told everyone, "These sandals are like Rama's feet.  We'll treat them like a king! I will keep the kingdom safe for Rama. When he comes back, I will give him the kingdom. I will be his servant. This will show everyone I am not ashamed of what happened."

Bharata lived simply in Nandigrama. He wore simple clothes and kept his hair messy.  He put Rama's sandals on the throne and treated them like a king.  He asked the sandals for advice before making any decisions.  He ruled the kingdom for his brother, waiting for Rama's return.
