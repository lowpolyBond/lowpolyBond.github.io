Rama and his brother Lakshmana were very sad.  They were looking for Sita, Rama's wife.  Lakshmana said, "Rama, let's search everywhere! We'll find her!"

They walked through a scary forest.  It was full of tall trees, dark caves, and scary animals.  Then, they saw something terrible!  A big, hurt bird lay on the ground.  It was Jatayu, a powerful bird-king.

Rama was angry. He thought a monster had hurt Sita.  But Jatayu, even though he was hurt, spoke!  He said, "Ravana, a ten-headed monster, took Sita away! I fought him, but I couldn't stop him."

Jatayu told Rama where Ravana went. Rama dropped his bow. He was so sad.  He hugged Jatayu and cried.  He felt terrible.  Losing Sita, being away from home, and now Jatayu dying â€“ it was all too much.  Rama held his friend, the dying bird-king, and wondered where Sita was. He was heartbroken.
