Nikumbha was very angry!  His brother had been killed by Sugriva, the monkey king. Nikumbha glared at Sugriva, ready to fight. He grabbed his HUGE mace. It was as big as a mountain!  It was shiny and scary, all decked out with gold and jewels.

Nikumbha roared and swung his super-powerful mace. It was so bright, it looked like lightning!  The wind howled, and the stars seemed to spin around!  Nikumbha was so strong and scary, nobody dared to move.

But Hanuman, a brave monkey, wasn't afraid!  Nikumbha swung his mace at Hanuman's chest.  *BOOM!*  The mace broke into pieces, but Hanuman didn't even flinch! He was as strong as a mountain!

Hanuman punched Nikumbha so hard, Nikumbha stumbled!  The people of Lanka cheered.  Hanuman punched him again and again! He was so strong, he lifted Nikumbha up in the air!  Then, with one final mighty punch, Hanuman knocked Nikumbha to the ground.  He grabbed Nikumbha's neck and ripped off his head!

Nikumbha screamed as he died.  Then, Rama's army and Hanuman's monkey army fought a big battle.  The monkeys cheered when Nikumbha was dead. The ground shook, and everyone was amazed by Hanumanâ€™s strength!
