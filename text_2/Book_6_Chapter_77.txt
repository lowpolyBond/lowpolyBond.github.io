In battle fierce, where courage burned like fire,
Nikumbha's wrath, a tempest to inspire.
His iron club, like Mandara, held high,
With gems and gold, it pierced the very sky.

His chest adorned with medals shining gold,
His arms with bracelets that the tales had told,
With club in hand, he roared with fearsome might,
A cloud of fury, bound for deadly flight.

He hurled the club, a sun in blinding glare,
Sky spun around, as if in wild despair.
But Hanuman, steadfast, faced the dire attack,
His chest unmoved, like mountains, strong and black.

The club, it shattered, meteors in the air,
Hanuman stood, unshaken, strong and fair.
With fist like thunderbolt, he struck his foe,
Armour split wide, like lightning's deadly glow.

Yet Nikumbha, undaunted, showed his power,
Lifted Hanuman high in that dread hour.
But Hanuman, fierce as tempest's gust,
Struck back, his foe's colossal form he thrust.

With both hands 'round his foe's strong neck, he pressed,
And twisted, turned, until his head found rest.
Nikumbha's roars were silenced, battle won,
By Hanuman, the mighty, he was undone.

As Nikumbha fell, a cheer from monkeys rang,
The earth rejoiced, the heavens with thunder sang.
In battle's heat, where heroes clashed with might,
The demons trembled, Rama stood in sight.
