Once upon a time, a wise man named Valmiki wanted to know all about Rama, a very brave and good prince.  He heard a story about Rama from a travelling storyteller named Narada.  Valmiki closed his eyes and thought very hard.  He used special magic to see Rama's whole life, like a movie in his mind!

He saw Rama's birth. He saw Rama being kind to everyone. He saw how strong and brave Rama was. He saw Rama help a wise man named Vishwamitra. He saw Rama win a contest by breaking a huge bow!  He saw Rama marry a beautiful princess named Sita.

Then, Valmiki saw some sad things.  Rama's stepmother tricked his father, the king, and Rama had to leave his home and go live in the forest with Sita and his brother Lakshmana.  His father was very sad and died.  Rama was very sad too.

In the forest, Rama and Sita faced many dangers.  A ten-headed monster named Ravana kidnapped Sita! Rama and his friends went on a big adventure to rescue her.

Valmiki saw Rama and his monkey friends fight Ravana's army. He saw the brave monkey Hanuman fly across the ocean to find Sita. Hanuman even set Ravana's city on fire!

Finally, Rama defeated Ravana and rescued Sita!  They all went back home to Ayodhya. Rama became king, and everyone was happy.

But Valmiki saw more. He saw everything that happened to Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana.  All of Rama's adventures and all the good things he did.  Then, Valmiki wrote a very long poem about Ramaâ€™s life, a poem that teaches us to be brave, kind, and true. That poem is called the Ramayana!
