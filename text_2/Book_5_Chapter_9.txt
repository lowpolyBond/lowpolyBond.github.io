Hanuman, the mighty monkey, was searching for Sita. He found a HUGE palace! It was so big, it took four miles to walk around it.  This was Ravana's palace, the king of the demons.  

The palace was guarded by soldiers and elephants with big tusks. Inside, many women lived. Some were wives of Ravana, others were princesses he had taken.  It was like a busy ocean full of fish and sharks.  The palace even had a flying car! It was called Pushpaka, made of gold and jewels. It shone like the sun!

Hanuman got on the Pushpaka. He smelled delicious food and drinks. The smells were so strong, they seemed to say, "Ravana is this way!"

He found a giant, sparkly room.  It was Ravana's favorite room! The floors were made of crystal and jewels.  Beautiful carpets covered the ground.  The room smelled wonderful.  It was decorated with flowers and looked so lovely, it felt like paradise.

Hanuman saw many women asleep. They were princesses and queens. They were wearing beautiful clothes and jewelry. They were all so lovely, they looked like stars in the sky.  Some were tangled in their own clothes and jewelry.  It was like a beautiful garden with lots of flowers!

Hanuman thought, "If Sita were here, Ravana would be lucky indeed, but Sita is much more beautiful and kind." He knew Sita was far better than all these women. Ravana had done a bad thing to take her away from Rama.
