Rama killed a magic deer.  This deer was actually a mean giant who could change shapes!  Rama hurried back to his home, worried about his wife, Sita, and his brother, Lakshmana.

He heard scary sounds.  Jackals were howling!  Rama thought, "Is Sita okay?  The giant deer tricked me.  Maybe the giants hurt Sita while I was gone!"

Rama felt scared.  He saw birds and animals looking frightened.  Then he saw Lakshmana, looking very sad.  Rama knew something was wrong.

Lakshmana looked pale.  Rama knew Lakshmana had left Sita all alone in the forest!  The forest was a dangerous place for Sita, because giants lived there.

Rama was very upset.  He held Lakshmana’s hand and said, "Lakshmana, you shouldn't have left Sita alone!  The giants might have hurt her!  I'm worried about her.  All these scary sounds…I think something bad happened to Sita."

Rama felt terrible. He thought maybe Sita was gone or even hurt. The giant deer had tricked him, and now he was afraid Sita was in danger.
