Hanuman, the super-strong monkey, finished his first job: destroying the demon's garden.  He thought, "What's next?  I'll burn down their city!"

He had a flaming tail, like a lightning bolt!  He zoomed across the rooftops of Lanka.  Whoosh!  He set fire to Prahasta's palace.  Whoosh! Maha-parshva's palace went up in flames.  He kept going, burning down more and more palaces!  He burned Indrajit's house, Jambumalin's, Sumali's, and many, many more!  Even Kumbhakarna's giant house went up in smoke!

Then, he burned the demons' treasure!  Finally, he reached the king's palace â€“ a huge, sparkly building!  He used his fiery tail to light it on fire.  The flames spread fast!  Gold, jewels, and pearls melted!  The palaces crumbled like sandcastles.

The demons screamed!  "It's the Fire God!" they shouted.  Some ran, some were trapped in the flames.  Babies cried.  Women cried.  The city was in chaos!

Hanuman, like a powerful wind, kept burning, burning, burning. The fire was HUGE, like the end of the world!  It was so bright and beautiful, but also scary.

The demons were terrified.  "Is it a god?  Is it a monster?" they wondered.

Hanuman watched his amazing work. He had burned the whole city!  He was very strong. He was very brave. He had helped Rama.

When the fire was out, the gods and goddesses were amazed.  They cheered for Hanuman!  He had done a great job!  He was a hero! After all his hard work, Hanuman went back to thinking about Rama. He had done what he was asked to do.
