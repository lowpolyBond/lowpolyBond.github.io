Eleven days later, Prince Bharata cleaned himself.  The next day, he gave away lots of treasures – jewels, gold, silver, beautiful clothes, and many other things – to the wise priests. He even gave away tons of white goats and cows, servants, chariots, and horses!

On the thirteenth day, Bharata was very, very sad. He went to see his father's ashes.  He cried, "Father! You left me! Rama, my brother, is in the forest, and now you're gone too! Where did you go? What about Mother Kaushalya?"  He cried so hard he fell to the ground.  Everyone tried to help him up.

Bharata's brother, Shatrughna, was also very sad. He cried, "Father, why did you leave us?  Who will give us nice food and gifts now?  The earth should crack open!  Rama is gone, and now you are too! I can't live without you both. I'll go to the forest and live alone."  Many people in the palace were so sad they also fell to the ground.

A wise priest, Vasishtha, helped Bharata up.  "Thirteen days have passed," he said gently. "Everyone gets hungry, thirsty, happy, sad, born, and dies.  It's part of life. Don't be so sad." Another wise man, Sumantra, helped Shatrughna.  He also explained that everyone dies someday.

Bharata and Shatrughna were still very sad, but they stood up tall.  Then, everyone helped them finish the ceremonies for their father.
