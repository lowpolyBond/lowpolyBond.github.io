Long ago, in the land of Lanka, lived a powerful king named Ravana.  He was very sad because his brother had died in battle.  One of his friends, Trishiras, said, "King Ravana, brave kings don't cry! You're strong enough to rule the whole world! You have amazing weapons – a spear, a bow, a chariot pulled by a thousand mules!  You can defeat Rama!"

Trishiras even offered to fight Rama himself!  Ravana's other sons, Devantaka, Narantaka, and Atikaya, were also ready to fight. They were super strong and brave warriors. They could fly, use magic, and had never lost a battle before!

Ravana was happy. He gave his sons shiny jewels and sent them off to battle, along with his brothers, Yuddhonmatta and Matta, to help.  Mahodara rode a big, strong elephant. Trishiras rode in a fancy chariot. Atikaya had a sparkly chariot too! Narantaka rode a super-fast white horse. Devantaka and Mahaparshva were strong and ready to fight, too.

The brothers looked like shining suns as they rode to battle on elephants, horses and chariots. They roared loudly, ready for a fight! The monkey army, led by Rama’s friends, saw them coming.  They were ready too!  They shouted back and got ready to throw rocks and trees.

The battle began! Monkeys and giants fought with rocks and trees.  They hit each other with swords and spears. Blood flew everywhere!  It was a huge, messy fight.  Monkeys fought in the air and on the ground.  Giants fought from elephants and chariots.

One giant, Narantaka, was especially strong. He was so fast he killed hundreds of monkeys! He was like a whirlwind on the battlefield.  The monkeys were scared.

But then, Sugriva, the monkey king, told his strongest warrior, Angada, to fight Narantaka. Angada was super strong, even stronger than Narantaka!

Angada didn't even need weapons! He used his bare hands and fought Narantaka.  He broke Narantaka’s spear and then smashed his horse!  Then Angada punched Narantaka so hard that he fell to the ground.

Everyone cheered! Angada had won! The monkeys were happy, and Rama was very proud of Angada’s bravery. The battle raged on, but Angada’s victory gave the monkeys new hope.
