Hanuman, the strong monkey, was happy to hear Sita's words. Sita, Rama's wife, was a kind and gentle woman.  She explained that she couldn't ride on Hanuman's back across the wide ocean. She said, "I can only touch Rama."

Hanuman understood. He told Sita, "I came to Lanka to find you and take you back to Rama.  It was very hard to get here! I talked to you like this because I wanted to help Rama."

Hanuman asked Sita for something to show Rama that he had really found her. Sita, sad but brave, told him a story:

"Tell Rama about the time we were near the Mandakini River," she said. "A crow kept pecking at me. I got angry and my clothes fell down! Rama laughed, and I was embarrassed.  The crow hurt me, and I fell asleep on Rama's chest.  When I woke up, the crow pecked me again!  Rama was so angry, he used a magical grass blade to chase the crow away!"

Sita continued, "Rama is so strong and brave. He can defeat anyone! Why doesn't he rescue me? I must have done something very wrong."

Hanuman comforted Sita. "Rama and Lakshmana are very sad because you're gone. They'll come and rescue you! They are powerful and will defeat the evil Ravana."

Sita then asked Hanuman to give a message to Rama and Lakshmana:  "Tell Rama I love him and I'm very sad. I'm not well and may not live much longer. Tell Lakshmana I'm waiting for him. Please hurry, and bring me home!"

Sita gave Hanuman a beautiful pearl from her forehead.  "Give this to Rama," she said.

Hanuman was so happy! He took the pearl and bowed to Sita. He felt like he could fly back to Rama right away! He knew he had to get back and help Rama rescue Sita.
