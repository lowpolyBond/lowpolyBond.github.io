Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana were living happily in a forest hut.  They had bathed in the beautiful Godavari River.  Every morning, Rama and Lakshmana prayed. They lived near wise holy men.  Rama was very handsome, like the moon shining brightly.

One day, a scary female demon named Shurpanakha came to their hut. She was Ravana's sister.  Shurpanakha thought Rama was incredibly handsome. She was very ugly, but she wanted to marry him!

Shurpanakha asked Rama, "Why are you here in the forest?  It's dangerous!"

Rama, very politely, explained, "I'm Rama, the son of King Dasaratha. This is my brother Lakshmana, and this is my wife, Sita. We're living here because my father asked us to."  Then Rama asked Shurpanakha, "Who are you?"

Shurpanakha said, "I'm Shurpanakha, a powerful demon! My brothers are Ravana, Kumbhakarna, and Vibhishana. I want to marry YOU, Rama!"

Shurpanakha was jealous of Sita.  She said, "Sita is ugly!  I'm much prettier. I'll eat Sita and Lakshmana, and then you and I can be together!"

Rama was very kind, but he didn't like Shurpanakha at all.  He politely said no, and that's when things got much more exciting...
