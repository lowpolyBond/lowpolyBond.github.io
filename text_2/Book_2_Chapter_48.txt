King Dasharatha had to send his son Rama away.  Everyone in the city was very sad.  They cried and cried.  They didn't want to eat or play.  

The homes were quiet.  No one smiled.  No one lit fires for cooking.  Even good news didn't make them happy.  Moms weren't happy to see their kids come home.  

The women told their husbands, "We need to follow Rama and Sita!  What good is our home without them?  They're good and kind. We'll serve Sita, and you can help Rama in the forest.  What's the point of living if we're not with them?"

They were angry at Kaikeyi, who made Rama leave.  They said, "Kaikeyi doesn't care about us! She's mean.  She took our king and sent Rama away."  They worried about what would happen to their kingdom without Rama's goodness.

The women cried so much!  It was dark and quiet in the city. No one prayed or sang. The shops were closed.  Ayodhya, their beautiful city, felt empty and sad, like a dark night with no stars. They missed Rama more than their own family. They loved him so much!
