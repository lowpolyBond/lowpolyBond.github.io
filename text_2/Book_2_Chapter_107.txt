Long ago, in a kingdom far away, lived Prince Rama. His stepmother, Queen Kaikeyi, made his father, King Dasaratha, promise two things: to send Rama away to live in the forest for fourteen years, and to make her son, Bharata, king.

Rama was sad, but he kept his father's promise.  He went to the forest with his wife, Sita, and his brother, Lakshmana.

Bharata was very upset. He visited Rama in the forest and begged him to come back and be king.  Rama explained that he had to keep his father's promise. He told Bharata it was important to be truthful and keep promises.

Rama said, "Bharata, you should be king.  You can make everyone happy.  I will be happy in the forest. It’s important to honor our father’s word."

Rama told Bharata a story about a king who showed his love for his father by being a good person.  He said having good sons who do good things is very important.

Rama asked Bharata to go back to the kingdom and be a good king. He said, "Bharata, you rule the people, I'll rule the forest.  Let’s honor our father's name by being good and kind."

Rama and Bharata hugged. Bharata went back to be king, and Rama continued his life in the forest with Sita and Lakshmana.  They all wanted to make their father proud.
