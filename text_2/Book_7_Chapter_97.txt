Rama had been sad. He had sent Sita away, even though he knew she was innocent.  A wise man named Valmiki talked to Rama. Valmiki said Sita was good and Rama should take her back.

Rama agreed! He said, "You are right! I made a mistake. I want Sita back. I'm sorry I sent her away. I also want to meet my twin sons, Kusha and Lava."

Then, amazing things happened!  All the gods came – Brahma, and many, many more!  They wanted to see Sita.  Even the wind felt wonderful, like a sweet smell in the air.

Sita came, wearing a pretty yellow dress. She bowed her head.  She said, “If I only ever loved Rama, please, Mother Earth, take me!”

Suddenly, a magical throne appeared! It was carried by giant, beautiful snakes!  Mother Earth herself came and hugged Sita. She helped Sita sit on the beautiful throne. Flowers rained down from the sky!  The gods cheered, “Sita is so good!”

The gods were very happy.  Everyone was amazed!  People on Earth, in the sky, even underground, celebrated! The whole world shook with joy! Rama and Sita were together again.  Everyone was so happy for them.
