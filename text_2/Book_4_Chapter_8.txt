Rama, the brave prince, and his brother Lakshmana met Sugriva, a monkey king.  Sugriva was so happy to have such powerful friends! He said, "With you, I can get my kingdom back!  Being your friend is an honor.  Friends always help each other, rich or poor, happy or sad."

Rama smiled and said, "That's true!  We'll help you."

The next day, Sugriva and Rama sat together under a beautiful tree. Hanuman, a strong monkey, brought a seat for Lakshmana.

Sugriva looked worried. He told Rama, "My brother, Bali, is very mean! He stole my kingdom and my wife!  I'm scared of him. Please help me!"

Rama said, "Don't worry!  I'll defeat Bali today! I have powerful arrows. You'll see Bali fall!"

Sugriva was so happy!  He cried, "You are my best friend, Rama! I've told you all my troubles, and I trust you completely."

Sugriva explained how cruel Bali was.  Bali had driven him away, taken his wife, and even tried to kill him.  Sugriva said, "Bali is my enemy. If he's gone, I'll be safe!"

Rama asked, "Tell me everything about your fight with Bali. I want to understand why you hate each other."

Sugriva felt much better knowing Rama was going to help. He was ready to tell Rama the whole story.
