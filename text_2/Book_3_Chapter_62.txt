Rama was very sad.  His beautiful wife, Sita, was missing! He missed her so much. He looked all around, calling her name.

"Sita," he whispered, "don't hide from me!  You're like a playful deer hiding in the bushes, but this isn't funny anymore.  Our home is empty without you!"

Rama was worried.  He thought maybe some mean giants had taken Sita away.  He even saw some sad deer, and he wondered if they knew what happened.

"Lakshmana," he said to his brother, "I'm scared.  What if something terrible happened to Sita?"

Rama felt terrible. He had promised to take Sita home. Now she was gone.  He imagined what people would say. They'd think he was a bad husband, a coward.  He wouldn't be able to face Sita's father, King Janaka.  The king would be very sad.

"I can't go back home without Sita," Rama cried. "I'd rather stay here in the forest.  Ayodhya wouldn't be home without her.  Lakshmana, you must go back.  Tell my brother Bharata to rule the kingdom.  Tell our mothers I love them.  And tell themâ€¦ tell them what happened to Sita and me."

Rama was heartbroken. Lakshmana was very scared, too. He didn't know what to do.  They were both so sad and lost without Sita.
