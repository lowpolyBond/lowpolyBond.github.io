Angada, the strong son of Bali, spoke up.  "Those two monkey brothers, the Ashvins' sons, are super strong!  They're so proud because a powerful god made them unable to die. They even drank magic juice that made them immortal! They could destroy Lanka all by themselves – its buildings, chariots, and elephants!  And *I* could destroy Lanka too, with all its giants and Ravana!  With a strong army, we could easily win!

Hanuman, the son of the wind god, already went to Lanka. He saw Sita, but he didn't bring her back.  We shouldn't tell Rama about our own strength. You are the bravest monkeys ever!  Hanuman is so strong, almost everyone who fights him loses!  All we need to do is defeat Ravana and his giants and bring Sita back to Rama and Lakshmana! We don’t need help from the other monkeys in Kishkindha. Let's go to Lanka, fight, and bring Sita home!"

Wise old Jambavan said, "Angada, you're very smart! But King Sugriva and Rama told us to explore the south. They didn’t tell us to bring Sita back.  Rama is a very proud king. He promised everyone he would rescue Sita himself.  We can't go against his wishes!  Showing off our strength won't help.  Let's go back to Rama, Lakshmana, and Sugriva and tell them what we found.  Your plan is good, Angada, but we need to do what Rama wants for success!"
