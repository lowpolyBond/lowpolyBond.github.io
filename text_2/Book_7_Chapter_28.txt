Once upon a time, a powerful demon named Ravana's son, Indrajit, was fighting the Gods.  He had a booming voice like thunder! He was super strong and brave.  He rode a cool chariot and fought like a wildfire, scaring all the Gods. They started to run away!

But the King of the Gods, Indra, told them, "Don't be scared! Fight back!"  Indra's son, Jayanta, joined the battle in his amazing chariot.  Then the Gods and the demons fought a great battle.

Indrajit threw lots of golden arrows at Jayanta's chariot driver. Jayanta got angry and attacked Indrajit's driver. Indrajit was furious! He threw all sorts of weapons—spears, swords, even huge rocks!  It got so dark and messy, no one could see!

Suddenly, a giant demon named Puloman grabbed Jayanta and disappeared into the sea!  The Gods were sad and scared and ran away.  Indrajit was happy, he shouted loudly and attacked the Gods again.

Indra was worried.  He called for his chariot.  Whoosh! It arrived with amazing speed.  Clouds and lightning appeared!  Music played, and magical dancers appeared too! Many other Gods joined Indra to fight.  

Ravana’s brother, Dashagriva, also came to fight on his special flying chariot, pulled by huge snakes!  He was very strong and fierce.  Another mean demon, Kumbhakama, joined the fight, too. He used everything—his teeth, feet, hands, anything he could find!

The Gods fought hard.  Many demons were hurt and fell.  The battlefield was covered in blood!  Dashagriva saw his army losing and jumped into the battle, even challenging Indra himself.

Indra pulled his powerful bow.  *Twang!*  His arrows flew like fire.  Dashagriva shot back!  It was a huge, dark, and chaotic battle, with arrows flying everywhere!
