Long ago, King Dasharatha felt very sad.  He couldn't sleep.  He was remembering something bad he did a long time ago.

He told Queen Kaushalya, "I did something wrong.  It's like planting a useless tree and hoping for yummy mangoes! I hurt someone a long time ago, and now I'm paying the price."

He explained what happened.  One rainy day, he went hunting.  He heard a sound in the dark. Thinking it was an elephant, he shot an arrow.  But it wasn't an elephant!  It was a young man, getting water for his parents.

The young man cried out, "Who did this? I haven't hurt anyone! My poor parents need me!" He told the king how old and weak his parents were, and how they depended on him.

The king felt terrible. He went to the young man, who was hurt and bleeding.  The young man looked angry but told the king, “I am not a Brahmin, so it’s not as bad as killing a Brahmin.”  Even so, he was still very hurt.  The young man died in the king's arms.

The king was so, so sorry. He knew he had done a very bad thing. He had hurt the young man and made his parents sad.  He said that it was like he'd eaten poison and now he was sick. He realized his mistake and he was sad about it.  He knew this was why he was so unhappy.
