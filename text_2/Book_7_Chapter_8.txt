Once upon a time, a powerful demon named Malyavan was fighting a great battle.  He had a huge army, but a strong god named Padmanabha (also called Narayana) was defeating them.

Malyavanâ€™s army was wiped out!  Malyavan stopped running, like the ocean when it hits the beach.  He was furious! His eyes were red with anger, and he trembled.  He shouted at Padmanabha, "You're cheating!  You're killing soldiers who are running away! That's not fair! If you're so strong, fight me fairly!"

Padmanabha said, "I promised the gods I would protect them from you! Your destruction is more important than my own life! I will defeat you!"

Malyavan threw his spear.  It hit Padmanabha, but Padmanabha pulled it out and threw it right back!  The spear flew like a shooting star and hit Malyavan hard! Malyavan was hurt, but he kept fighting. He hit Padmanabha with his club, but Padmanabha was too strong.  Malyavan ran away a little bit. Everyone cheered, "Great fight!"

Then Malyavan fought Padmanabha's friend Garuda. Garuda was like a giant bird. He blew Malyavan away with his powerful wings, like the wind blowing leaves!

Malyavan's boss, Sumali, saw this.  He was scared, so he and all the other demons ran away back to Lanka, their home.

Padmanabha was so strong, he defeated all the demons! They were so afraid of him that they hid underground.  Only Sumali and a few others stayed behind.  Padmanabha was a very, very powerful god, who always helps good people and defeats bad guys!  That's how it was in those days.  Now, let's hear about the even stronger demon king, Ravana...
