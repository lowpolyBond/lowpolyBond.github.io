Deep in the forest lived Guha. He saw Rama's brother, Lakshmana, keeping watch over Rama and Sita who were sleeping.  Guha wanted to help.

"Lakshmana," Guha said, "sleep on a soft bed!  You deserve rest. We'll watch Rama."  Guha loved Rama very much.  "We'll protect him," he promised.

But Lakshmana said, "How can I sleep on a soft bed when Rama and Sita sleep on the hard ground?  I can't be comfortable if they aren't." He was worried about his family back home. "My father, and mother will be so sad," he said.  "My father might even die."

Lakshmana missed his home, a beautiful city with tall buildings and lots of happy people.  He wondered if they would ever return.

Guha helped Lakshmana and Rama that night.  When the sun came up, Guha helped them cross the river. Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita looked strong and brave, with their hair all matted together.  They looked like brave elephants, walking away!
