Once upon a time, a wise man named Vishvamitra asked Prince Rama for help.  Rama was super strong and brave.

“Wise man,” Rama said, “this Taraka is super strong!  They say yakshinis aren't that powerful. How is she so strong?”

Vishvamitra explained, “Long ago, a kind yaksha named Suketu wanted a child. He prayed so hard that the great god Brahma gave him a daughter, Taraka.  Brahma made her as strong as a thousand elephants! But he didn't give Suketu a son.”

“Taraka grew up beautiful. She married Sunda, and they had a son named Marica.  But Marica was cursed and became a scary rakshasa (demon)!” Vishvamitra continued.  "Then, another wise man, Agastya, was angry with Sunda and cursed him to die.  Taraka wanted revenge on Agastya.  Agastya was so mad at Taraka, he cursed her to become a terrible, ugly demon too!  Now she's scaring everyone and destroying the land."

Vishvamitra looked at Rama. "Rama, you must defeat Taraka! It’s your job to protect everyone. Even if it's hard, you must do it.  Many great heroes have fought evil women before.  Taraka is evil. You must stop her!”

Rama knew what he had to do.  He was ready to fight the terrible Taraka to save everyone.
