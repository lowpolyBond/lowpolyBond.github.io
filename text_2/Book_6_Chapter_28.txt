A bird named Shuka told King Ravana about Rama's army.  He said, "Look at those strong monkeys! They're as big as trees! They can change shapes, just like magic!  There are millions of them!"

Shuka pointed out two super-strong monkeys, Mainda and Dvivida.  "They're so brave, they even drank magic water that makes them almost immortal!" he said.

Then he talked about Hanuman, a very strong monkey.  "Hanuman is so strong, he tried to eat the sun when he was little!  He jumped really, really high, but the sun is too far away. He's the one who found Sita and even set fire to your city, Lanka, before!"

Shuka described Rama, the brave king who wanted to rescue Sita. "Rama is like a warrior god," Shuka explained.  "He's very brave and always does what's right.  His brother Lakshmana is just as strong and fights right beside him."

Next, he pointed to Vibhishana, Ravana's brother. "He's now helping Rama and wants to fight you!"

Finally, Shuka talked about Sugriva, the monkey king.  "Sugriva has a HUGE army!  Millions and millions of monkeys are with him. They're ready to fight!"

Shuka warned Ravana, "This army is powerful, King Ravana. You need to be ready for a big battle!"
