Rama sent his helper to find his brothers: Lakshmana, Bharata, and Shatrughna.  He told the helper to hurry!

First, the helper went to Lakshmana.  He bowed and said, "The King wants to see you, quickly!" Lakshmana said, "Okay!" and zoomed to the palace in his chariot.

Next, the helper went to Bharata. He bowed and said, "The King wants to see you!" Bharata jumped up and ran.

Then, the helper went to Shatrughna.  He bowed and said, "The King wants to see you! Lakshmana and Bharata are already on their way." Shatrughna got up and hurried to see Rama.

The helper went back to Rama.  He bowed and said, "Your brothers are here!"

Rama was very sad.  His eyes were full of tears. He looked very unhappy.  He told the helper, "Bring them to me quickly! They are my whole world!"

The brothers came, all dressed in white. They bowed down to Rama. Rama looked so sad, like a dark moon or a cloudy sun.  He hugged them tight and cried.

He said, "You are my everything! You helped me become king!"  His brothers were worried and wondered what he would say next.
