Princess Sita was flying high in the air!  A scary giant, Ravana, was carrying her away.  She was very scared and cried, "You bad man! Why did you take me? I'm all alone!"

Ravana had tricked Sita's husband, Rama, into leaving her. He had changed into a deer to lure Rama away. Then, he even killed a friend who tried to protect Sita!

Sita shouted, "You didn't even fight me fairly!  You're a coward! Everyone will know what you did!  You're going to be punished!"

Sita was brave. She warned Ravana, "My husband Rama and his brother Lakshmana are very strong. They will find you and defeat you!  They're much stronger than you are! You'll be sorry!"

She continued, "Even if Rama never finds me, I would rather die than live with you! You're making a big mistake.  You'll face terrible things â€“ scary forests, a river of blood, and sharp, deadly trees!"

Ravana ignored Sita.  He flew away with her, even though she kept shouting and struggling.  Sita was very upset, but she wouldn't give up. She knew Rama would save her.
