Rama asked a wise man, "How did Ravana's brothers become so strong?"

The wise man, Agastya, said, "They did very hard things!  Kumbhakarna, the biggest and strongest, was super tough.  In the summer, he stood in five fires! In the rainy season, he stood in a special pose.  And in the winter, he sat in freezing water! He did this for two thousand years!"

"Bibhishana, the good brother, was amazing too! He stood on one leg for five thousand years!  Then he stood facing the sun for another five thousand years, thinking good thoughts.  The gods were so happy, they showered him with flowers!"

"Ravana, the ten-headed king, did something even harder. Every thousand years, he gave one of his heads to the fire god!  After nine thousand years, he only had one head left.  He wanted to give that one away too!"

Ravana asked the great god Brahma for a gift. He asked for immortality â€“ to live forever.  But Brahma said, "I can't give you that!"

Ravana then asked, "Please don't let me die from any animal, spirit, or god!"

Brahma said, "Okay."  He also made all of Ravana's heads grow back!  And he gave Ravana another special gift: he could change into anything he wanted!

Then Brahma spoke to Bibhishana. He said, "You did a great job! What gift do you want?"

Bibhishana said, "I just want to always be good and do the right thing. And I want to be able to use powerful magic!"

Brahma smiled and said, "You shall have it! You will live forever!"

The gods didn't want to give Kumbhakarna a gift. They were scared of him!  So they tricked him. They whispered into his mouth so he asked to sleep for a very, very long time!

After that, the three brothers went home, happy and powerful.
