Once upon a time, a wise and powerful magician named Vishvamitra went to see King Dasaratha.  He said, "King, you're a great and good king!  But I have a problem.  Two mean, magic-using monsters, Marica and Subahu, keep ruining my important ceremonies!"

Vishvamitra explained that these monsters were very strong and always stopped his magical ceremonies.  He couldn't fight them himself because he was busy with his magical work.  "But," he said, "your son, Rama, is very brave and strong.  He could defeat these monsters!"

Vishvamitra promised to teach Rama amazing things.  He said, "Rama is the only one who can defeat these monsters. With my help, Rama will become very famous!"

The king loved his son Rama very much.  He was worried about sending him away.  But Vishvamitra said, "Don't worry, King! Rama will be safe with me.  Just let him come with me for ten days, and I promise to bring him back safe."

The king was sad. He loved Rama very much.  He thought and thought, and he felt very upset. The kind words of Vishvamitra made the King worry and he fainted from worry!
