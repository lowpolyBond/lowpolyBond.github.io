Rama was talking to his brother Lakshmana.  Lakshmana said, "Rama, you told a story about a king and a wise man.  Why couldn't King Nimi forgive the wise man?"

Rama answered, "Lakshmana, people don't always forgive! Let me tell you about King Yayati. He had two wives. He loved one more than the other.  One wife's name was Sharmishtha, and the other was Devayani."

"Sharmishtha had a son named Puru, and Devayani had a son named Yadu.  Yayati loved Puru best because he was Sharmishtha's son. Yadu was very sad. He told his mother, 'Mom, the king doesn't treat you well. It's awful! I can't stand it!'"

Yadu was so upset, he wanted to die! Devayani, his mother, was very angry. She went to her father, a powerful wise man named Shukra.

Devayani told her father, "My husband ignores me!  I can't live like this!"

Shukra was furious! He cursed King Yayati. He said, "Yayati, you will become very old and weak!"

Then Shukra made Devayani feel better and went home.  See, Lakshmana?  Sometimes people don't forgive, and terrible things happen!
