Hanuman, the brave monkey, returned from his long journey to Lanka.  He had found Sita, Rama's wife!  The other monkeys were so happy to see him.  Jambavan, a wise old monkey, asked Hanuman, "Tell us everything! How did you find Sita? How is she?  What is the evil Ravana doing?"

Hanuman, excited, told his story.  "I jumped from a mountain," he said. "A mountain with wings, Mainaka, helped me! He told me about Rama and asked me to help him."

Then, Hanuman met Surasa, a giant snake-lady.  "You're my lunch!" she said. But Hanuman tricked her! He changed his size so quickly she couldn't eat him.  Surasa was impressed and let him go.

Next, a scary demon grabbed him!  But Hanuman was even stronger! He beat the demon and continued on.  Lanka, Ravana's city, looked like a big, scary fortress.

Hanuman snuck into Lanka!  He finally found Sita in a beautiful garden, sad and alone.  She was guarded by mean women.  Ravana came to see Sita. He was very mean and threatened her.  Sita was brave and stood up to him!

Hanuman watched from a tree, hiding.  He felt very sad for Sita.  Then, he decided to talk to her.  He told her that Rama had sent him. He gave Sita Rama's ring. Sita was so happy! She gave Hanuman a beautiful jewel to take back to Rama.

Sita asked Hanuman to tell Rama to come quickly and save her. Hanuman, furious, got really big and strong! He destroyed Ravana's beautiful garden! Then, he fought lots and lots of Ravana's soldiers. He defeated them all!  

Even Ravana's son, Indrajit, couldn't stop Hanuman.  Finally, Indrajit caught Hanuman and took him to Ravana.  But Hanuman told Ravana about Rama and the monkey army.  Ravana, very angry, ordered his soldiers to set Hanuman's tail on fire.

But Hanuman was clever! He escaped!  With his burning tail, he set fire to a big part of Lanka! He was sure Sita was safe.  He jumped back to the monkeys, his heart full of hope. He had done everything Rama asked!  Now, it was time for Rama to come and rescue Sita!
