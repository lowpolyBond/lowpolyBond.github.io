King Indra had a plan. He wanted to trick the wise and powerful Sage Vishvamitra! He asked a beautiful nymph named Rambha to distract the Sage.  "Rambha," Indra said, "make the Sage forget his important work!"

Rambha was scared.  "But King Indra," she said, "the Sage is very angry! He might curse me!"

Indra said, "Don't worry! I'll help."

Indra made a plan.  In springtime, he and the god of love would hide near Rambha.  Rambha would sing a pretty song, and a cuckoo would sing too.  This would distract the Sage.

Rambha, dressed in her finest clothes, went to the Sage.  She sang beautifully.  The cuckoo sang a sweet song.

The Sage heard the songs. He saw Rambha. He remembered a time long ago when he was tempted. He knew it was Indra's trick! He was furious!

"Rambha!" he shouted, "You tried to trick me!  You will become a rock for ten thousand years!"

Suddenly, Rambha turned into stone! Indra and the god of love ran away.

The Sage was sad. He had lost his progress because he got angry. He decided to make up for it. "I will stand perfectly still for a thousand years," he said. "I will not eat, I will not speak. I will only think good thoughts."  He wanted to be very, very wise.
