One night, the sky was bright and clear.  Hanuman saw the moon shining.  But Sugriva, the monkey king, was having a party!  He’d won back his throne and was busy enjoying himself with his wives, Ruma and Tara. He was having so much fun, he forgot all about his work and his friends. He left his helpers to run the kingdom.

Hanuman, a very clever and kind monkey, saw this. He knew Sugriva had promised to help Rama find his wife, Sita.  Hanuman went to Sugriva and spoke softly but firmly.

"King Sugriva," Hanuman said, "you've gotten your throne back!  Now it's time to help your friends.  That's the right thing to do! Helping your friends makes you even stronger and more powerful.  You should care about your friends as much as you care about your kingdom and your riches."

Hanuman continued, "If you don't help Rama, you'll fail.  Rama is waiting for you to keep your promise.  He’s a great friend and helped you win back your throne.  He even risked his own life for you!  Even if he hadn't helped you, it would be right to help him now.  Rama is so strong, he can defeat even the gods and monsters! He's just waiting for your army to help find Sita."

Hanuman added, "We monkeys are ready!  We'll search everywhere, even under the sea and in the sky!  We have millions of strong monkeys ready to help!"

Sugriva finally understood.  He knew Hanuman was right.  He decided to act quickly.  He told Nila, a brave monkey general, to gather the army.  

"Gather every monkey soldier!" Sugriva commanded. "Anyone who doesn't come within fifteen days will be punished!  Angada, you go find the strongest soldiers.  Do it quickly!"

Sugriva knew he had to keep his promise to Rama.  He went back to his palace, ready to help find Sita.
