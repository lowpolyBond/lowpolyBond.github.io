Rama was very, very sad.  His heart ached. He cried and cried.  His brother Lakshmana saw this.  He held Rama's feet and said, "Brother, don't be so sad."

Lakshmana said, "Our father, King Dasaratha, was a good king. He did many good things, and that's why he got you.  Even great kings and gods have sad times.  Remember Yayati? Even he had bad luck! Even Vasishtha, our father's priest, lost many sons.  The Earth itself shakes sometimes!  Even the sun and moon get dark. Even the gods have problems. You are strong and brave, Rama! Don't let sadness win."

"Even if Sita is gone," Lakshmana continued, "you shouldn't give up.  Great people don't give up easily.  Think carefully, Rama.  Figure out what's good and what's bad.  You're very wise. You've always taught me that we must act. We can't just wait.  Even the gods can't teach you everything you already know! "

"Rama," Lakshmana said, "don't let sadness take over.  Remember how strong you are! Find the person who hurt you and make things right!"
