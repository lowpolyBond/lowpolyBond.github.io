Sugriva, the monkey king, needed to find Sita. He sent lots of monkeys in different directions to look for her.  He talked to a strong monkey leader named Sushena, who looked like a big, fluffy cloud!

Sugriva told Sushena and many other monkeys to go west.  "Find Sita!" he said.  "Search everywhere!  Look in Saurashtra, Bahlika, and Candracitra.  Check Kukshi, a place with lots of pretty trees.  Look in forests, mountains, and even near the ocean!  There are whales and crocodiles there, but don't worry!"

He told them to look near the sea.  "Search Murachipattana, Jatapura, Avanti, and Angalapa," he said.  "Look in the Alakshita forest, too."

Sugriva pointed to a tall, golden mountain called Somagiri. "Monkeys who can change shape, search there!  Wild elephants live there." He also told them about another mountain, Pariyatra. "It's in the middle of the sea and it's covered in magic fruits," Sugriva said. "Don't eat those fruits! They are guarded by powerful beings called Gandharvas. Just look for Sita!"

He told them about other mountains: Vajra, Charavat, Varaha, and Sarvasauvarna.  They were all very big and full of exciting places to explore.  "Keep looking!" Sugriva said.

Finally, Sugriva told the monkeys about Mount Meru, the biggest mountain of all!  "A beautiful palace is there, but don't bother the beings who live there.  Just keep looking for Sita and Ravana!"

Sugriva said, "Ask a wise man named Merusavami if he's seen Sita."  He told the monkeys to search until the sun set.  "Return in a month!" Sugriva warned.  Then all the monkeys bowed and went off to find Sita.
