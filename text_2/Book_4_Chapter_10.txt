Once upon a time, there was a monkey king named Bali.  He had a brother, Sugriva, who was very kind.  Bali went to fight a giant. He told Sugriva to wait outside a big cave while he fought.

Bali fought for a whole year! When he finally won, he couldn't find the cave entrance.  He was trapped! Sugriva, thinking his brother was dead, closed the cave with a big rock and became king.

When Bali finally escaped, he was very angry! He yelled at Sugriva and chased him away.  He even took Sugriva's wife! Poor Sugriva ran away and hid.

Sugriva was so sad.  He met Rama, a brave prince, and told him everything. Sugriva begged Rama for help.

Rama listened carefully. He smiled and said, "Don't worry! My arrows are strong and true. I'll defeat Bali and help you get your kingdom back!"

Sugriva was so happy! He knew Rama would help him.  He felt brave again, ready to face his angry brother with Rama's help.
