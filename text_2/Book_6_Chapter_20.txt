Ravana, the king of the demons, was worried.  He sent a spy, Shardula, to check out Rama's army. Shardula saw a HUGE army of monkeys and bears! He zoomed back to Ravana and said, "King!  There are SO many monkeys and bears, more than you can imagine! Rama and Lakshmana are there, looking for Sita!"

Ravana was scared. He sent another demon, Shuka, to talk to Sugriva, the monkey king. Shuka was supposed to say, "Sugriva, you're strong!  Don't worry about Sita. You can't defeat us!  Just go home!"

Shuka flew to Sugriva's army.  But the monkeys weren't happy to see him! They jumped on him and started to hit him. Shuka yelled, "Stop! I'm an ambassador!"

Rama told the monkeys to stop hitting Shuka.  Shuka then gave Sugriva Ravana's message.

Sugriva laughed.  "You're not my friend!" he roared. "You and Ravana are bad!  We will defeat you! We will destroy Lanka!"

Angada, another strong monkey, said, "He's a spy! Don't let him go!"

The monkeys grabbed Shuka and tied him up.  Shuka cried, "Please don't kill me!  If I die, bad things will happen to you, Rama!"

Rama was kind. He told the monkeys to let Shuka go.  Shuka, scared and hurt, flew back to Ravana.
