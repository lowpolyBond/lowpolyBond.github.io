Once upon a time, a powerful demon named Dushana led five thousand strong demons to fight Rama. They threw rocks, trees, and spears at Rama, but they couldn't hurt him! Rama was so brave; he fought back with his arrows, like a strong bull in a rainstorm.

He was very angry, so he shot many arrows at Dushana and his army.  Dushana fought back with his powerful weapons, but Rama was stronger. Rama broke Dushana's bow, killed his horses, and even cut off his charioteer's head!  Then, he hit Dushana three times with his arrows, right in the chest.

Dushana had a huge, golden mace – it was so big, it looked like a mountain! He swung it at Rama, but Rama was too quick.  He shot arrows and cut off both of Dushana's arms! The mace fell to the ground, and Dushana fell down too, like a big elephant that had lost its tusks. Everyone cheered for Rama!

Then, three more strong demon generals attacked Rama.  But Rama was ready! He quickly killed one with an arrow, knocked another down with many arrows, and blinded the third one. He even killed five thousand more demons!

When the demon king Khara heard about Dushana's death, he got very angry. He and twelve more strong demon generals attacked Rama.  But Rama was super strong and brave! He shot many golden and diamond arrows and killed all the rest of Khara’s army. The ground was covered with dead demons.  Rama fought all by himself, on foot, and he killed fourteen thousand demons! Only Khara and one other demon were left alive.

Finally, Khara himself came to fight Rama in his chariot. That’s the next part of the story!
