Prince Bharata woke up early. He wanted to see his brother, Rama.  He climbed into his shiny chariot. It was like a sun chariot, so bright!

Many people went with him.  There were horses, elephants, and carts full of soldiers.  Bharata's mom and aunts rode in fancy chariots too. Everyone talked about Rama.  They said, "Rama is strong and good. Seeing him will make us happy!"  They were all very excited.

Lots of people joined the prince.  There were artists, builders, weavers, even dancers and musicians!  Everyone wanted to meet Rama.  They all wore nice clothes and smelled of sweet sandalwood. They rode in all sorts of vehicles â€“ chariots, carts, even on elephants!

They traveled a long way.  Finally, they reached the Ganges River.  This is where Guha, Rama's friend, lived.  Bharata stopped his army there.

Bharata looked at the beautiful river. He said, "Let's camp here tonight. Tomorrow, we'll cross the river. First, I want to pray for my father."

Everyone agreed. They all camped by the river.  Bharata sat alone in his tent. He was thinking hard about how to bring Rama home.  He really, really wanted his brother back.
