Rama, Lakshmana, and their monkey friend Sugriva left the mountain.  They were going to Kishkindha, Bali's strong city. Rama carried his shiny golden bow and arrows.

Sugriva, with a flower crown, walked ahead.  Behind him came Hanuman, Nala, Nila, and Tara, all brave monkeys.

The land was beautiful!  Flowers covered the trees.  Rivers flowed to the sea.  There were caves, cliffs, and pretty valleys.  Lakes sparkled like emeralds.  Birds sang, and deer grazed peacefully.  Even big elephants roamed around!

Rama saw some strange trees.  They looked like a big cloud of trees! He asked Sugriva, "What are these amazing trees?"

Sugriva explained, "Rama, that's a secret hermitage! Seven wise men, called Munis, lived there a long, long time ago. They were super-duper good.  Even gods couldn't enter! It's magical; you can hear music and smell wonderful scents." Sugriva told Rama to bow to the wise men.

Rama and Lakshmana bowed to the hermitage.  Then, they continued on their journey.

Soon, they saw Kishkindha!  It was a strong city, protected by Bali. Rama, Lakshmana, and the monkeys got ready to fight!  They were ready to defeat Bali!
