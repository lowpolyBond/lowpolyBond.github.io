Bibishana, a kind prince, saw King Ravana making a big mistake.  Ravana had kidnapped Sita, and was bragging about how strong he and his brothers were.  Bibishana said, "King, why did you kidnap Sita?  She's like a beautiful snake, her sadness is its poison, and her tears are its fangs.  The monkey army is coming, and they're HUGE!  Give Sita back to Rama before they attack!"

Ravana's friend, Prahasta, laughed. "We're not scared of anyone!" he boasted. "Not gods, not giants, not even the strongest monsters!  Why should we fear Rama?"

Bibishana shook his head. "Prahasta, you're wrong! Rama is super strong! He's unbeatable!  None of Ravana's brothers – Kumbhakarna, Indrajit, or anyone else – can defeat him. It's like trying to swim across the ocean without a boat!"

Bibishana tried again. "Prahasta, you and the others are just flattering Ravana.  You're his friends, so you should help him!  He's trapped like a fly in a spiderweb. Rama is coming to get him and Lanka!  Give Sita back to Rama!"

Bibishana pleaded, "Please, give Sita back!  It's the only way to save everyone!"  He said a good advisor tells the truth, even if it's hard to hear.  He warned Ravana that the consequences of not listening would be terrible.
