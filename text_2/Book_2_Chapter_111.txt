Once upon a time, a wise teacher named Vasishtha talked to Prince Rama.  He said, "Rama, your parents and teacher are very important. Your parents gave you your body, and your teacher gives you wisdom."

Vasishtha told Rama, "Respect your family, friends, and everyone in the kingdom. Always be kind and do what's right." He also said, "Always listen to your mother.  It's important to obey her."  Then Vasishtha told Rama that it was right to follow his father's wishes, even if it was hard.

Rama said, "I'll always listen to my father. He's done so much for me. He took such good care of me when I was little."

Rama's brother, Bharata, was very sad.  He told his driver, Sumantra, "Make a bed of grass for me. I'll sit here and ask Rama to come home." Bharata wanted Rama to be king, and he was very upset that Rama was going to live in the forest.

Bharata sat on the grass and waited.  Rama saw him and said, "Bharata, why are you doing this?  You don't need to do this."

Bharata said, "Please, everyone, ask Rama to come home!" But everyone said, "Rama will do what his father said."

Rama heard this and said to Bharata, "Listen to your friends. Think about it.  Let's drink some water together and let's be friends."

Bharata stood up and said, "I don't want to be king! I didn't even know Rama was going to the forest! If anyone should go to the forest, it should be me! I'll go instead of Rama."

Rama was amazed! He said, "Bharata, we can't change what our father decided.  I'll go to the forest, and when I come back, we can rule the kingdom together."  Rama was happy that Bharata was so kind and good.  He knew that Bharata would be a great king.
