Once upon a time, Queen Kaikeyi had a helper named Manthara.  Manthara was a bit mean.

One day, Manthara looked out from the palace.  She saw Ayodhya, the city, all dressed up!  Flowers everywhere!  People were happy and celebrating.  They were getting ready for Prince Rama to become the next king.

Manthara saw Rama's nurse, all dressed in white.  She asked the nurse, "Why is everyone so happy? What's going on?"

The nurse, very excited, said, "Tomorrow, Prince Rama will become the next king!"

This made Manthara very angry. She was jealous.  She rushed to Queen Kaikeyi's room. She woke her up.

"Wake up!" Manthara whispered. "Something terrible is happening! The king is going to make Rama the next king, not your son!"

Queen Kaikeyi was worried.  "What do you mean?" she asked.

Manthara, who was very clever at lying, said, "The king is tricking you! He's only nice to your face.  He wants to give everything to Rama's mother! He's not fair to you or your son! You must do something!"

Manthara told Queen Kaikeyi that she should ask the king for two wishes he had promised her long ago.

Queen Kaikeyi was surprised. She liked Rama just as much as her own son.

But Manthara kept talking and talking, until Queen Kaikeyi felt really upset.   Manthara gave her some bad ideas.  She convinced her to ask for two things:  that Rama be sent far away, and that her own son, Bharata, be made the next king instead.

Queen Kaikeyi, who was a kind queen, was tricked into making this terrible decision.  She listened to Manthara, and gave her a lovely gift.  This was the beginning of a big problem for everyone.
