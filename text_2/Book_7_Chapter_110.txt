Rama walked a few miles.  He saw the Sarayu River.  It was beautiful and sparkly!  He went to a special place called Goprataraka Ghata.  All his friends were there.

Suddenly, the sky shone brightly!  It was Brahma, the great god, with lots of other gods and wise people.  Flowers rained down, and beautiful music played.

Brahma talked to Rama.  He said, "Rama, you are a god! You're going back to your heavenly home!  Go back to being Vishnu if you want! You are amazing!"

Rama listened to Brahma.  He and his brothers went back to their heavenly home.  All the gods were so happy! They cheered and worshipped him.

Vishnu, who was Rama, asked Brahma, "Please give my friends a good home in heaven. They were so brave and good."

Brahma said, "Everyone here goes to a wonderful place called Santanakas!  Even the monkeys and bears who helped you will go to a happy place near my home!  Sugriva, the monkey king, is going to the sun!"

The monkeys and bears changed back into their true godly forms.  They went into the Sarayu River and went to heaven.  Everyone who went into the river went to heaven too!

Then, Brahma and all the gods went back to their home in the sky, very happy.
