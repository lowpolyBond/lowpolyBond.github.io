Once upon a time, a wise man named Vishvamitra visited a hermitage.  He brought with him Rama, a very brave and kind prince.  Shatananda, the son of the hermit, was amazed to see them!

Shatananda asked Vishvamitra many questions.  He wanted to know if Vishvamitra had visited his mother, if he had given her food, and if he had told Rama about his family. He wondered if Rama's visit had made his father happy again.

Vishvamitra said, "I did what was right.  Just like Shatananda’s father had been angry with his mother but then forgave her, I helped everyone.”

Then Shatananda talked to Rama.  "Your visit made everyone happy!" he said. "Thank you for coming and helping my family.  And thank you, Vishvamitra, for being so kind!"

Shatananda then told Rama a story about Vishvamitra.  A long time ago, Vishvamitra was a powerful king. He ruled his land for many, many years.  He loved his people.

One day, the king decided to travel. He went to many places, crossing rivers and mountains. Finally, he reached a beautiful hermitage.  It was a magical place!

Many, many wise people lived there.  There were birds, animals, and even special beings from the sky. All of them were very peaceful and kind.  The king was very happy to see such a wonderful place.
