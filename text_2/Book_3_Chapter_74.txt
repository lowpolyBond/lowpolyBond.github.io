Rama and his brother Lakshmana were on a journey.  They followed directions to find their friend, Sugriva.  They walked and walked, past pretty trees with yummy fruits.  They slept on a hilltop.

The next day, they found Shabari's home.  It was a cozy little hut in the woods.  Shabari was a very old woman who had lived there a long, long time. She was very happy to see Rama and Lakshmana.  She bowed down and offered them water to wash their feet.

Rama asked Shabari about her life.  He wanted to know if she had been a good and kind person. Shabari said she had been very good and had followed all the rules. She said that meeting Rama made all her hard work worth it.  She even told Rama how her teachers had told her that Rama would come visit, and when he did, she would go to heaven.

Shabari showed Rama and Lakshmana a special forest.  Her teachers had lived there and prayed there a long time ago.  She showed them where they had prayed and even showed Rama some of the things her teachers had left behind.

Then, Shabari said it was time for her to go to heaven to be with her teachers. She jumped into a fire and, whoosh!  She flew up into the sky, beautiful and shining.  She went to live happily ever after with her teachers in heaven. Rama and Lakshmana were very happy for her.  They continued on their journey.
