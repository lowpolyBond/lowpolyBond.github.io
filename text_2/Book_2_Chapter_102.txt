Rama's dad died!  Bharata, his brother, told him the sad news.  Rama was so shocked, he fainted! He fell to the ground like a tree that's been chopped down.  Sita and his brothers poured water on him to wake him up.

When Rama opened his eyes, he was very, very sad.  He cried, "My father is gone! Who will take care of our kingdom now? I couldn't even say goodbye!"  He felt bad that Bharata had done the last rituals for their dad.

Rama turned to Sita and said, "My father-in-law is gone. Lakshmana, you don't have a father anymore.  Lakshmana, get some special fruit pulp, and I'll change my clothes. We need to do a special ceremony for our father."

Sumantra, a wise old man who loved Rama, helped them. They went to a beautiful river and offered water to remember their father.  Rama poured water and said, "Father, may this water reach you." They also made a special food offering for him.

Rama was so sad.  He cried with Sita, Lakshmana, and Bharata. Their crying echoed through the mountains like a lion's roar!

The army heard the crying. They rushed to see Rama.  They were so happy to see him, but also very sad about the king's death. They were angry at Kaikeyi and Manthara, who had caused all the trouble.

Everyone cried together.  The whole place was filled with sadness. Rama hugged his friends and family, showing them how much he cared.  It was a very sad, but also a very loving, moment.
