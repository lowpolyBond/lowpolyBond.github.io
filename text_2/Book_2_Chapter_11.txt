Once upon a time, Queen Kaikeyi loved King Dasaratha very much.  She wanted something special, so she asked him for a promise.  She said, "If you love me, promise me anything I want!"

King Dasaratha loved Kaikeyi very much. He said, "My dearest Kaikeyi, I promise!  I'll give you anything you wish. You're more precious to me than anyone, except maybe our son Rama."

Kaikeyi had been tricked by a mean woman named Manthara.  Manthara made Kaikeyi jealous of Rama.  So, Kaikeyi remembered a long-ago promise.  Long ago, when King Dasaratha was hurt in a big battle, Kaikeyi saved him.  He had promised her two wishes in return.

Kaikeyi told the king, "King, you promised me two wishes! I want them now! I saved your life, and now itâ€™s your turn to give me what I asked for."  The king was very happy to keep his promise. He agreed, ready to do anything she wanted.

Kaikeyi said, "My first wish is for my son, Bharata, to become the king. My second wish is that Prince Rama, your favorite son, must go live in the forest for fourteen years.  He has to wear simple clothes and live like a hermit!"  She wanted Rama to leave right away.

The king was very sad. He loved Rama very much.  But he had made a promise, and he had to keep it.  Even though it broke his heart, he agreed to send Rama away to the forest.  This is how Rama, the brave prince, went to live in the forest.
