Prince Bharata needed a road!  So he sent lots of workers.  There were builders, wood cutters, well-diggers, and even cooks!  They were like a huge, moving sea!

These hardworking people chopped down trees, cleared bushes, and moved rocks.  They made a path, planting new trees and trimming branches.  Strong men burned big tree trunks.  They filled holes with mud and built bridges over little rivers.  They even made the road smooth, getting rid of pebbles and thorns.  They dug wells for water and built places to rest.  They made the road look beautiful, like a magical path, sprinkling it with sweet-smelling sandalwood and pretty flowers.

Clever builders made comfy houses near water and fruit trees.  They made camps for the army, just like Prince Bharata wanted.  They made sure everyone had everything they needed.

Special people who knew about stars and planets built a special place for Prince Bharata to stay.  It was huge, like a blue mountain, with deep ditches all around and lots of roads going in and out.

They built pretty white temples and houses with flags. The houses had balconies, like pretty birdhouses, and everything looked so amazing, it was like the home of the gods!

The road went all the way to the Ganges River!  The river was cool and sparkly, with fishes swimming.  The whole road was so beautiful, with the river and the trees, it looked like the night sky with its moon and stars.  It was a perfect road for Prince Bharata!
