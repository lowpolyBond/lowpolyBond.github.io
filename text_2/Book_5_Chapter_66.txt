Hanuman gave Rama some good news.  Rama held a special jewel close to his heart and cried.  Lakshmana cried too.  The jewel was so beautiful!

Rama was very sad.  He said to Sugriva, "This jewel makes me miss Sita so much! My father-in-law gave it to Sita when she married me. She wore it on her forehead, and it made her even more beautiful.  It's a magical jewel from the ocean, given to King Janaka by the Gods.

"When I see this jewel, I remember my father and Sita's father. It makes me feel like Sita is here with me.  Please, Sugriva, tell me everything Sita said!  Seeing this jewel without Sita is so painful.  I need to know she's okay.  If she lives another month, she'll live a long time, but I can't live even a moment without her!

"Hanuman, please tell me again what Sita said!  Her words will make me feel better, like medicine makes someone healthy.  How is my sweet Sita doing? How is she surviving with those scary demons?  She's always been shy, how can she be brave enough for this?  She's like the moon hidden by cloudsâ€”her light is gone.  Tell me everything, Hanuman! Tell me everything my beautiful Sita said!"
