Once upon a time, a mean king named Ravana kidnapped Sita, a beautiful princess.  Sita was very brave. She wasn't scared of Ravana, even though he was huge and powerful.

She told Ravana, "You’re nothing! My husband, Rama, is the strongest hero in the whole world! He has big strong arms and kind eyes. He's like a lion! He and his brother, Lakshmana, will come for me, and they'll defeat you easily. Rama is so strong, he can even make the ocean dry up!

"Rama will find me!  You can’t hide me forever.  He'll punish you for taking me!" Sita drew a blade of grass to show she wouldn't let Ravana touch her.

Ravana was angry.  He shouted, "If you don't obey me in one year, I will hurt you!"

Then, Ravana ordered his scary female guards to take Sita to a beautiful garden. The garden was full of pretty flowers and tasty fruits, but Sita was sad and scared. She missed Rama and Lakshmana terribly.  She felt like a little deer surrounded by scary tigers. Sita was so upset she fainted.

The guards watched Sita closely. They tried to be nice sometimes, and mean other times, hoping to make her give up.  But Sita remained strong, always remembering Rama.  She knew he would come to save her!
