Rama and Lakshmana, two brave princes, stayed overnight and said hello to a wise old man.  The old man, like a kind grandpa, pointed the way to their new home, Cittrakuta.

"Go west," he said, "near where two big rivers meet. You'll see a wobbly old boat.  Use a long stick with buckets on each end to cross the river. On the other side, you'll find a big, dark green fig tree. Many magical people visit it.  Pray there for your wishes to come true! Then keep going a little further to Nilvan, where there are lots of lovely trees. That's the path to Cittrakuta; I know it well. It's safe and beautiful."

Rama thanked the old man and said to Lakshmana, "We are so lucky he helped us!"

Sita, Rama's wife, walked in front.  They reached the river.  They didn't have a boat, so they made a raft with bamboo and grass. Lakshmana made Sita a comfy seat with leaves. Rama helped Sita onto the raft.  Then they floated across.

In the middle of the river, Sita bowed and prayed, "River Goddess, please help Rama and let us reach our new home safely. I'll give you a thousand cows when we come back!"

They reached the other side and found the big fig tree. Sita bowed to the tree and prayed for Rama to be safe and for her to see her mom and other family again.

Rama said to Lakshmana, "You take Sita ahead; I'll follow with my weapons. Find any fruits or flowers she likes."

Sita walked between the brothers, like a princess with two strong guards.  She asked Rama about all the new plants and trees. Lakshmana picked flowers for her.  Sita was happy seeing the river, the birds, and all the pretty things.

They hunted some deer for food. They walked through a beautiful forest with peacocks and monkeys.  They found a nice place to sleep and were safe and happy.
