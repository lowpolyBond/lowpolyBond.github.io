Lakshmana asked Rama, "Brother, how did the wise king Nimi and the great sage Vasishtha get their bodies back after they died?"

Rama smiled.  "Nimi and Vasishtha had a big argument.  They were so angry, they lost their bodies! They became spirits."

"But Vasishtha wanted his body back," Rama continued.  "He went to Brahma, the great god.  Vasishtha begged, 'Please, I need a body! I can't do good things without one!'"

Brahma said, "Go to Mitra and Varuna, the gods of friendship and water.  Enter their special seed, and you'll be reborn."

Vasishtha went to see Varuna.  Varuna was very happy to see the beautiful Urvashi, a magical water nymph, playing in the water.  He wanted to be with her.

But Urvashi said, "Mitra, another god, asked me to be with him!"

Varuna was sad. He said, "Okay, I'll put my special seed in a special bowl Brahma made."  Urvashi agreed.

Urvashi then went to see Mitra.  Mitra was very angry! "You went with Varuna?  That's not fair!"  He cursed Urvashi to live as a human for a while.

Urvashi had to live on Earth.  She married Pururavas, a king, and had a baby named Ayu.  Ayu's son, Nahusha, even ruled the gods for a long time!

After a long time, Urvashi's punishment was over. She went back to live with the gods.  And that's how Vasishtha got his body back â€“ he was reborn as Ayu's descendant!
