Ravana, the powerful king of the demons, wanted to kidnap Sita.  But first, he asked Marica, a clever demoness, for help.

Marica was brave, and she wasn't afraid to tell Ravana the truth.  "King Ravana," she said, "who gave you this terrible idea?  It will lead to your death, the death of your family, and the ruin of your kingdom!  This is a very bad plan. Your advisors should stop you, but they are not doing their jobs."

She explained, "Good kings protect their people, and their people protect them.  But you are a cruel king, Ravana.  You are violent and unfair. Because of this, your kingdom will fall."

Marica said, "A bad king is like a reckless chariot driver who crashes into a ditch, taking everyone with him.  And a cruel king can't protect his people anymore than a jackal can protect a herd of deer. You and your army will be defeated by Rama."

"I'm not the one who should be worried," she said, "It's you! You will soon die in battle with Rama. Even if you kidnap Sita with my help, it will be the end for you, your kingdom, and all the demons."

"I'm trying to help you," Marica told Ravana.  "But you won't listen.  It's like someone who is about to die ignoring their friends' warnings."  She knew that kidnapping Sita would be Ravana's downfall.
