Rama, the brave prince, had lots of friends: monkeys, bears, and even giants!  After the big battle, Rama talked to his friends.

He told Sugriva, the monkey king, "Go back to your kingdom, Kishkindha! Rule wisely, and be kind to your friends, like Angada, Hanuman, and all the others who helped us."  Rama hugged Sugriva tight.

Then Rama spoke to Vibhishana, the kind giant who helped them: "Rule Lanka well, be fair to everyone.  Remember me and Sugriva."

All the animals and giants cheered, "Hooray for Rama! He's so wise and brave!" They said he was as great as the gods!

Hanuman, the strongest monkey, bowed to Rama.  "I will always be your friend," he said. "As long as people tell your stories, I will live!"

Rama hugged Hanuman. "You're the best," he said. "I'll never forget what you did."  Rama gave Hanuman a beautiful necklace with a bright green gem.  Hanuman looked like a shining mountain!

One by one, all Rama's friends bowed down and said goodbye.  Sugriva and Vibhishana cried.  Everyone cried. Saying goodbye was very sad.  Rama had given them many gifts.  With tears in their eyes, the monkeys, bears, and giants went home.  They would never forget their brave friend, Rama.
