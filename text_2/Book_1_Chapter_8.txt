King Dasaratha was a good king, but he didn't have any children. He wanted a son to be his heir, so he decided to do a special ceremony called a horse sacrifice.  It was a big deal!

He called a meeting with his wise advisors, including his best friend Sumantra. He told them, "Please get all the best priests and wise men here!" Sumantra quickly went to get them.

King Dasaratha told the priests, "I've been a good king, but I have no son.  I want to do this horse sacrifice to get one.  Please help me!"

The wise priests said, "That's a wonderful idea, King!  Let's do it by the Sarayu River." They told him how to do the ceremony properly.  They said it was important to be kind to everyone and make sure nothing went wrong.  The king was very happy!

King Dasaratha told his helpers, "Make sure everything is perfect for this sacrifice! Be kind to everyone and don't let anyone stop us!" He told them to build a special place for the ceremony near the river.

Then, the king went to see his queens.  He said, "I'm going to do this big ceremony to have a son. Please be ready." The queens were thrilled! They were so happy their king wanted a child.

The king was excited. He knew if everything was done just right, he'd finally have the son he'd always wished for.
