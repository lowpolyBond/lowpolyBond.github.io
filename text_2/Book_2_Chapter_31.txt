Rama and Sita were going to live in the forest.  Lakshmana, Rama's brother, was very sad.  He cried, "I'm coming with you!  I'll protect you from wild animals!"

Rama didn't want Lakshmana to come.  He said, "Who will look after our mothers?  Our stepmother, Kaikeyi, might be mean to them."

Lakshmana said, "Don't worry, Brother! I'll protect our mothers too, if anything happens.  But I have to go with you.  I'll be your helper in the forest. I'll find food and show you the way."

Rama loved Lakshmana very much. He finally said, "Okay, Lakshmana, but first, ask your mother for permission. Then, get my special bow and arrows from Sage Vasishta's house."

Lakshmana went to say goodbye to his family.  He got Rama's special weapons.

Rama was happy to see Lakshmana.  He said, "Let's give all our things to the poor and the wise people."

Rama gave away all his belongings. Then, with Lakshmana by his side, and his special weapons, he set off to the forest with Sita.
