Rama was worried about the forest.  It was dangerous! He asked Sita to stay behind.  But Sita loved Rama very much. She was scared, but she wouldn't leave him.

"Rama," Sita said, "If my father knew you were a little bit scared, he wouldn't have let me marry you!  You're brave, aren't you? Don't be sad. I'll go with you anywhere! I'll be your wife, even in the forest. I'll be happy, even if we sleep on the ground. The forest will be like a beautiful garden with you, Rama.  Thorny bushes will feel like soft fur. The dust will be like perfume!  I won't miss my home.  With you, the forest will be heaven. Without you, even the palace would be awful."

Sita cried.  Her tears fell like rain. Rama saw how much she loved him.  He hugged her.

"Sita," Rama said, "I don't want to go to heaven without you! I was scared for you, but I see how brave you are.  I have to go to the forest because my father told me to.  It's important to obey my parents.  But now, I see that you want to come too, and I'm so happy. Let's go together!"

Sita was so happy! She gave all her beautiful jewelry to the poor and the wise priests.  Then she was ready to go to the forest with Rama.  She knew it would be an adventure, and she was ready for anything with him by her side.
