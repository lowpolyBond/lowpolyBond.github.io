King Ravana was very sad. His son had died.  He roared like a lion!  He told his army, "Attack Rama! Throw everything you have at him!  Then, tomorrow, I'll kill him myself!"

The giants rushed into battle.  They had swords, spears, and axes. The monkeys fought back with rocks and trees!  It was a HUGE battle!  Dust flew everywhere, and blood flowed like rivers.  Monkeys fought bravely, tearing at the giants.  Hundreds of monkeys jumped on each giant at once!

Rama, a super strong hero, picked up his bow.  Whoosh! He shot arrows everywhere!  The giants couldn't even see him! He was so fast!  The giants, confused, started fighting each other!  They thought they saw Rama everywhere!

Rama had a magic weapon! It made him look like he was everywhere at once.  He was like a whirlwind!  In just a few hours, he wiped out almost the entire giant army â€“ thousands of elephants, horses, and soldiers!

The giants ran away, hiding back in their city. The battlefield was covered with dead elephants, horses, and soldiers.  Even the gods in the sky cheered, "Well done, Rama!"

Rama said, "Only I and the great god Tryambaka can use this powerful weapon!"  Rama was very tired, but he had won the battle!  The gods were very happy.
