Rama, tireless in valor, strong and bold,
With golden arrows, pure and bright as gold,
Felled thousands of elephants, a fearsome sight,
Sent by Ravana to conquer in their might.

A thousand horses, demons fierce in form,
Mounted chariots with banners, wild and warm,
Like fire, their maces clashed with iron rods,
Under their golden banners, fearless gods.

The demons, hearing of their comrades' fall,
Felt fear and sorrow, grief that touched them all.
They met their wives, and in their anguish cried,
As widows mourned, with tears of sorrow, sighed.

"Why did Surpanakha, old and vile,
Approach young Rama, full of charm and style?
How did this ugly demoness, so base,
Desire the one with virtue, form, and grace?

How did she dare to seek Rama's hand,
Whose virtues shone like jewels in the land?
For Surpanakha's folly, Ravana's wrath,
Brought Sita here, on a destructive path.

For Ravana, blinded by his lustful scheme,
Now seeks to make Sita's life a dream.
He cannot win her heart, her love untamed,
But endless enmity with Rama's name.

Yet, Ravana fails to see the truth so clear,
Rama's strength, his valor, without peer.
In Janasthana, Rama's might displayed,
Fourteen thousand demons met their fateful shade.

Khara, Dushana, Trishira met their doom,
Arrows, like the sun, dispelled their gloom.
Kabandha, with arms eight miles in span,
Fell to Rama's prowess, a mighty man.

Even Vali, son of Indra, fierce and black,
Found his end in Rama's bold attack.
Ravana, blind to lessons of the past,
With stubborn heart, to evil clung steadfast.

Vibhishaá¹‡, wise, gave counsel true,
But Ravana's ego, his mind it slew.
He paid no heed to wisdom's saving grace,
And thus, his kingdom turned into a bane.

Kumbhakarna's fall, Indrajit's demise,
Should've opened Ravana's worldly eyes.
Yet, he persists, in folly's dark embrace,
To face Rama's might, his own disgrace.

Rama's arrows rained on chariots and steeds,
Fell elephants, as his valor feeds.
He single-handedly slew the foes,
A thousand chariots, as his strength arose.

Rama, Rudra-like, fierce and Vishnu's form,
Or Indra, conquering demons in a storm,
Yama, the Lord of Death, in battle's call,
He's all of these, to make the demons fall.

The demons wail, in fear and sorrow's tide,
Their hopes and dreams, in Rama's might, subside.
Brahma's boon could not protect their lord,
From Rama's wrath, his strength, his holy sword.

Omens portend Ravana's final fate,
As each time his warriors meet their date.
Brahma's boon, a double-edged sword,
Now serves to bring the demons to the Lord.

But Ravana's heart remains cold and blind,
To Rama's power, his strength of noble kind.
He turns to darkness, in his reckless pride,
His path to doom, by ego's flames, denied.

Yet, Rama's mission is clear and bright,
To rescue Sita, his heart's delight.
In battle's fury, he'll reclaim his wife,
From Ravana's grasp, ending this strife.

As darkness falls, and fate's design unfolds,
The epic tale, in history's book, it holds.
