Rama was very, very sad.  His wife, Sita, had been taken away! He was so angry, he wanted to destroy the whole world!  He looked like a giant fire, ready to burn everything.

Lakshmana, Rama's brother, was scared. He saw how angry Rama was – angrier than he'd ever seen him before.  Lakshmana put his hands together and said, "Rama, you're usually so kind and gentle.  Don't be so angry! You're like the sun, so bright and strong. You're like the wind, so fast. You're like the earth, so patient.  Why destroy the whole world because of one bad person?"

Lakshmana pointed to some marks on the ground. "Look," he said, "this is where a fight happened.  There are wheel tracks and footprints and blood. It was just a small fight, not a big war.  We don't even know who fought or why."

He continued, "Kings should be fair and kind.  Everyone loves you, Rama! The rivers, the mountains, even the gods – no one wants to upset you. Let's find Sita. We can search everywhere – the oceans, the forests, the caves, everywhere! We’ll ask everyone we meet. If we can't find her nicely, then,  *then* you can use your powerful arrows."
