King Yudhajita loved Rama very much! He sent a wise priest, Gargya, to Rama with lots of amazing gifts:  ten thousand horses, beautiful carpets, shiny jewels, and wonderful clothes!

Rama was so happy! He met Gargya far outside his city and bowed to him like a big important person bowing to another.  He asked Gargya all about his uncle.

Gargya told Rama a message from his uncle.  "Your uncle wants you to conquer a land by the Sindhu River," Gargya said. "It’s full of fruit and belongs to strong Gandharva warriors.  Only you can win!"

Rama smiled.  He looked at his brother, Bharata. "Bharata," Rama said, "you, Taksha, and Pushkala will go and win this land for my uncle!"

Bharata, Taksha, and Pushkala were ready for an adventure! They took their army, and they set off.  So many soldiers marched with them! Even scary animals like lions and tigers followed the army!  It was a huge, impressive army!

After a month and a half, Bharata’s army reached King Yudhajita’s kingdom.  They were ready to fight the Gandharvas!
