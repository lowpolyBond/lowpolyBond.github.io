Ravana's mean army heard that Rama and his monkey friends were attacking Lanka!  Ravana was super angry. He looked out from his palace.  He saw SO many monkeys all around his city!  He wondered, "How can I get rid of them all?"

But then, Ravana got brave again. He looked at Rama's huge army.  Rama, remembering his wife Sita, felt very sad.  He thought, "Sita is all alone and scared in Lanka!"  Rama felt terrible.

He told his monkey army, "Let's attack!" The monkeys roared and were ready to fight!  They shouted, "Let's destroy Lanka!"  They climbed the walls, throwing rocks and trees. They smashed through gates and walls.

The monkeys were super strong!  They were brave and fought hard for Rama.  Some monkeys attacked one gate, others attacked another.  One brave monkey, named Kumuda, led a huge group to the east gate!

Ravana yelled at his army to fight back!  His army made a loud noise!  Drums banged, trumpets blew, and the titans marched forward.  It was a HUGE battle! Monkeys and titans fought with rocks, sticks, and even their teeth and claws!

The monkeys yelled, "Victory to Sugriva!"  The titans yelled, "Victory to Ravana!"  The battle was so loud and fierce!  The ground was covered in mud and dust. It was a very scary and amazing fight!
