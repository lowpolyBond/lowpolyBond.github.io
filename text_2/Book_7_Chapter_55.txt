Once upon a time, a long, long time ago, there was a brave and truthful king named Nimi. He was a great king, and he built a beautiful city near a wise hermit's home.  He decided to have a huge, important ceremony, like a big party to honor his father.

He invited lots of important people, like the wise Vasishtha. But Vasishtha was busy helping the mighty god Indra with *his* big ceremony.  So, another wise person, Gautama, helped King Nimi instead.

When Vasishtha was finished, he came to King Nimi's ceremony.  But he was very, very angry! Gautama had already done the ceremony! Vasishtha was so mad he shouted a curse:  "Because you didn't wait for me, you will lose your body!"

King Nimi woke up and heard the curse. He was angry too! He shouted back, "You cursed me while I was sleeping!  Because of that, *you* will also lose your body!"

Both King Nimi and Vasishtha were very powerful.  Because they were so angry, their curse worked right away!  Poof! They both lost their bodies!  It was a very sad, but also very powerful, story.
