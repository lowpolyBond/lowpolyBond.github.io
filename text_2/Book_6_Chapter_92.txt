Lakshmana, a brave warrior, fought bravely and defeated Indrajit, a powerful enemy.  He was hurt, but he felt very happy!

Lakshmana, with his friends Jambavan and Hanuman, went back to see Rama and Sugriva.  He walked with the help of Bibishana and Hanuman. He bowed to Rama.

Bibishana told Rama and Sugriva all about the battle.  Rama was so happy that Lakshmana had defeated Indrajit!  Rama shouted, "Well done, Lakshmana! You did a great job! Now we are closer to winning!"

Rama hugged Lakshmana, who was still hurt. He smelled Lakshmana's head and gently touched him.  Rama said, "You are amazing, Lakshmana!  Indrajit's death makes Ravana much weaker. We are closer to getting Sita back!"

Rama knew that Ravana would be very angry. He said, “Ravana will come with a big army soon, but I'm ready.  With you, Lakshmana, we can beat him!”

Rama asked a monkey doctor, Sushena, to help Lakshmana and the other hurt monkeys and bears.  Sushena gave Lakshmana some medicine, and he felt much better!  Everyone was very happy.  Rama was proud of Lakshmana.  They all knew that because of Lakshmana's bravery, they would soon defeat Ravana and bring Sita home!
