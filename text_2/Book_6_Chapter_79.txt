Once upon a time, brave Rama and his monkey friends were fighting some scary night-rangers.  The night-rangers were big and strong, and they fought with swords, clubs, and spears.  It was a huge battle!  The monkeys fought bravely, but the night-rangers were almost too strong.

Then the strongest night-ranger, Maharaksha, arrived! He was huge and angry.  He yelled at Rama, "Rama!  You killed my father! Now I will kill you!"

Maharaksha threw lots of arrows at Rama, but Rama was a super-skilled archer! He shot down all of Maharaksha’s arrows. Rama said, "Maharaksha, you talk too much!  Let's fight!"

They fought a super-duper amazing battle!  Everyone watched: even the gods and goddesses in the sky!  They used swords, spears, and bows and arrows.  It was so noisy!

Rama was so strong, he broke Maharaksha's bow!  Then Maharaksha threw a magical spear – it was a gift from the god Shiva! But Rama was even stronger, he shot the spear into many pieces!

Maharaksha was getting really angry. He charged at Rama, but Rama was ready.  He shot a special arrow that hit Maharaksha’s heart.  Maharaksha fell down and died.

All the other night-rangers were so scared, they ran away!  The gods were very happy. Rama had won! The battle was over, and everyone celebrated Rama's victory!
