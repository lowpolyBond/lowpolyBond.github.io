As Markaraksha took the field that day,
Monkeys and demons leaped into the fray.
A battle fierce, it caused one's hair to bristle,
Like heaven and hell in epic celestial gristle.

Trees and spikes hurled through the air,
Maces and clubs, a relentless affair.
Demons with javelins, swords in hand,
Sought to claim victory across the land.

Tormented by Makaraksha's fierce attack,
Monkeys were bewildered, courage lacked.
But Rama intervened, with arrows true,
Intercepting demons, their bravado through.

Makaraksha then challenged, anger ablaze,
To duel with Rama, end his mortal days.
"Since Dandaka's dark forest, evil grew,
Now, Rama, I'll put an end to you."

But Rama laughed, his words resounding clear,
"Your boasts, O demon, fall upon deaf ear.
With speech alone, no victory you'll find,
In battle's heat, deeds speak for humankind."

"Fourteen thousand demons met their doom,
Khara, Trishira, Dushana in the gloom.
Today, vultures and crows your flesh will feast,
For your evil deeds shall surely be ceased."

Makaraksha's fury, arrows unleashed,
Rama deflected, arrows breached.
A battle raged with thundering sound,
As arrows flew, the sky around.

Celestials, demons, from realms on high,
Kinnaras, Mahoragas, filled the sky.
Though pierced and wounded, strength redoubled,
Each blow returned, their bodies troubled.

The bowstrings hummed with thunder's might,
Arrows flew, a deadly dance of flight.
Demons roared, their battle cries resounding,
In that fierce combat, fate confounding.

Rama snapped the demon's bow in twain,
Struck the charioteer, horses slain.
Makaraksha stood, bereft of ride,
On the ground, his fury couldn't hide.

In his hand, a flaming spike he held,
A gift from Rudra, to wield and meld.
A weapon fierce, destruction it unfurled,
A terror in the hands of the demon world.

With fiery fervor, he hurled it high,
A flaming comet across the sky.
Rama's arrows met it in mid-flight,
Shattered it, like day against the night.

Scattered, it fell, like meteor's blaze,
The heavens watched, in silent praise.
Makaraksha, with heart now split asunder,
Fell to the earth, his fate no wonder.

Monkeys cheered, and demons fled,
Back to Lanka, in terror they sped.
Celestials watched, their spirits high,
As Rama's arrows painted the sky.

Markaraksha, the demon son of Khara,
Destroyed in battle, like a shattered tiara.
A mountain struck by lightning's might,
In that fierce clash, vanished from sight.
