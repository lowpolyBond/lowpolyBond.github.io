Once, after Rama defeated Bali, the powerful monkey king, Bali was hurt and angry. He shouted at Rama, saying Rama didn't know the rules.  He said Rama shouldn't have fought him.

Rama was calm. He explained, "Bali, you didn't follow the rules!  You were rude to me.  We are here to help Sugriva, your brother, get his kingdom and wife back. You took your brother's wife, which is wrong."

Rama said, "The land belongs to Bharata, our king, and we follow his rules.  A king must be fair, brave, and wise. You broke the rules by taking your brother's wife. That's why I fought you."

Rama continued, "You listened to bad advice.  You should have listened to your elders.  It's like blind monkeys leading blind monkeys! I had to stop you from being unfair."

Bali felt very bad. He realized he was wrong.  He said, "You are right, Rama. I was wrong. I spoke to you without thinking. Please forgive me."

Bali was worried about his son, Angada. He asked Rama to take care of him and his wife, Tara.  He wanted Rama to be kind to Sugriva.

Rama was kind. He said, "Don't worry, Bali. We will take care of Angada and Tara. We will help Sugriva. Everything happens for a reason, and by following the rules, you'll be okay."

Bali, very sad but understanding, was quiet.  He accepted what happened. Rama was kind and understanding. He forgave Bali. Bali died peacefully, knowing his son and wife would be safe.
