Ravana's brother, Vibhishana, tried to help him.  He said Ravana should listen.

But Ravana was angry! He shouted, "It's better to be enemies than to have a friend who secretly helps my foes! Family members often want to see each other fail.  They're like elephants who are scared not of fire or traps, but of other elephants who are mean!"

Ravana said, "Friendships with bad people are like water on a lotus leaf â€“ they slip away. They're like bees who leave after taking the honey.  If someone else said what you said, I would have killed them!  But you're my brother, so I'll just curse you!"

Vibhishana was hurt.  He held up his weapon. He said, "You're not thinking clearly, brother.  Even if you're wrong, I should respect you. But I can't stand your mean words! You're ignoring good advice because you're too proud.  You could get killed by Rama's arrows! Please listen to me!  Protect yourself and our city!"

Vibhishana was sad. He said, "You don't want my help. Goodbye, brother.  I hope you'll be happier without me.  People don't listen to good advice when they're about to die." Then Vibhishana left.
