King Sugriva, the monkey leader, called all his monkey friends together.  He told them, "Rama needs our help to find his wife, Sita!  Let's search everywhere!"

Whoosh!  Thousands of monkeys zoomed off in all directions!  They were like a giant, furry cloud covering the land.

Rama and his brother Lakshmana stayed on Mount Prasravana while the monkeys searched.  Shatavali, a brave monkey, raced north.  Vinata, another strong monkey, went east.  Tara, Angada, and many more, including Hanuman (the monkey son of the wind god!), went south.  Sushena, a super strong monkey, went west.

King Sugriva was happy. His monkey army was searching everywhere!

The monkeys were excited! They shouted and chattered, "We'll find Sita! We'll defeat the bad king Ravana!" Some boasted, "I'll fight Ravana myself!" Others said, "I'll find Sita even if she's in the deepest, darkest place! I can jump over mountains and through forests!"  One monkey bragged, "I can jump four miles in one leap!" Another said, "I can jump a hundred!"  And another said, "Nothing can stop me! I can jump anywhere â€“ over land, over water, even through the sky!"

The monkeys were strong and brave. They were ready for anything to save Sita!
