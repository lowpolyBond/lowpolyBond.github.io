Once upon a time, in a beautiful kingdom, lived Prince Rama. He was kind and brave, loved by everyone.  One day, Rama's father, the King, made a sad decision.  He said Rama had to leave the kingdom and live in the forest for fourteen years!

The ladies of the palace cried.  They loved Rama very much. He was always good to them, never angry, always helpful. They thought the King was making a big mistake.  They cried like little calves had lost their mothers. The King heard their cries and felt very sad too. He felt ashamed.

Rama, feeling sad for his family, went to see his mother, Queen Kaushalya.  He greeted the guards and wise old men along the way.  He finally reached his mother’s room.

Queen Kaushalya was praying. She was beautiful but looked thin from worrying and praying for Rama. When she saw Rama, she ran to hug him.  She was so happy to see him, but also very, very sad he had to leave.  She wished him a long and happy life, a good ruler.

Rama told his mother the bad news. He had to go live in the forest! He would sleep on grass, eat roots and berries, and live like a hermit.  He explained that his brother Bharata would rule the kingdom while he was away.

When Queen Kaushalya heard this, she fell to the ground, heartbroken.  Rama helped her up. She cried and cried.  She said that without Rama, her life would be miserable.  She would be treated badly by the other queens.  She felt like she had no reason to live. She said she'd rather die than live without him.  She said her life felt empty and meaningless.

The Queen’s sadness was so great because she loved Rama so much. She missed him terribly and did not want him to leave.  She thought of how much work she’d done to raise him and to get to this point. Now, all of that work felt for nothing. She was so upset.


She told Rama she would rather die than live without him. She cried that life without her son wasn't worth living.  It was a very sad day for everyone.
