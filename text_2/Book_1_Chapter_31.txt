Rama and his brother Lakshmana were super heroes! They helped a wise old man named Vishvamitra.  After helping him, they spent the night at his house.

In the morning, they woke up and said hello to Vishvamitra and the other wise men.  They asked, "What can we do for you now?"

Vishvamitra said, "Let's go to King Janaka's big party! He has a super cool, magical bow.  It's so strong, no one can even lift it!  Lots of strong kings have tried, but nobody could! Let's go see it!"

Vishvamitra explained that the bow was a gift from the gods.  It was so special that it was kept in a special place and everyone worshipped it.

So, Rama, Lakshmana, Vishvamitra, and all the other wise men started their journey.  Vishvamitra even said goodbye to the forest spirits!  Lots of animals and birds followed them for a while, but Vishvamitra asked them to go back.

They traveled and traveled.  When the sun went down, they reached a river. They took a bath, prayed, and had a little fire ceremony.

Rama then asked Vishvamitra, "Where are we? This place is so pretty!"

Vishvamitra was happy Rama asked.  He told them all about the beautiful land they were in.
