Bharata, a very good and obedient prince, wanted to find his brother Rama.  He had a big army, but he walked to find Rama himself!

First, he told his friend Shatrughna, "Go search the forest with some hunters. Find Rama's home!" He also sent Guha, a strong warrior with many soldiers, to help look for Rama.  Bharata said, "I'll walk through the forest with the wise men and townspeople. I won't stop until I see Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita! I want to touch Rama's feet and put him back on the throne!  Lakshmana is so lucky to see Rama every day. Sita is lucky too! And the mountain where Rama lives is lucky!"

Bharata walked and walked.  The forest was big and scary, with lots of snakes!  Finally, he climbed a tall tree.  He saw smoke! It was from Rama's home! Bharata and his friends were so happy! They were like people who had finally finished a long, scary boat trip.  Bharata left his army behind and hurried to see Rama.
