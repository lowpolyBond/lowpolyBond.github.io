Hanuman, the brave monkey, was looking for Sita. He knew she wouldn't be happy without Rama.  She wouldn't eat, sleep, or even put on pretty clothes without him!  He thought, "This must be a different Sita."

So Hanuman started searching again.  The palace was full of women!  They were all asleep after a big party.  Some were snoring softly, others had fallen asleep while chatting about their beautiful clothes or singing songs.  They were everywhere, like a whole herd of elephants sleeping together!

The palace was amazing!  There was delicious food everywhere – plates piled high with buffalo, deer, and peacock meat!  There were golden cups, sparkling wine, sweet treats, and colorful flowers scattered on the floor.  Beautiful bracelets and anklets were lying around.  It was a real feast!

Hanuman looked carefully at every sleeping woman.  Some were holding each other.  One even had stolen another's blanket! The air smelled sweet from flowers and perfumes. He saw women with dark skin and women with skin as golden as the sun.  They all looked like beautiful sleeping flowers.

But Hanuman still couldn't find Sita. He was worried he'd failed.  He thought, "Looking at sleeping women isn't right, but I had to look! I'm only here to find Sita. You find people like you; you wouldn't look for a woman among deer, would you?"

Hanuman looked at lots of women—princesses and queens from all over!  Still no Sita.  He felt sad but didn't give up.  He left the party room and went to search somewhere else.  He knew he had to keep looking for Rama's beloved Sita.
