Rama and his brother Lakshmana were friends with Sugriva, the monkey king.  After Sugriva became king, Rama and Lakshmana went to live in a cave on a big mountain called Prasravana.

The mountain was amazing!  Lots of animals lived there – tigers, deer, lions, bears, and even monkeys!  The cave was big and cozy.  Rama and Lakshmana decided to live there during the rainy season.

The mountain was beautiful. It had sparkling rocks, colorful flowers, and lots of trees.  There was even a lovely pool with pretty lotus flowers.  Rama described the place to Lakshmana, pointing out all the wonderful sights and sounds. He talked about the pretty birds singing, the rivers full of frogs, and even the special rocks that looked like shiny clouds.

Even though it was beautiful, Rama was very sad. He missed his wife Sita, who had been taken away. He couldn't sleep at night, he was so worried.

Lakshmana saw Rama was sad. He told Rama to be brave.  “Don’t be sad,” Lakshmana said.  "We need to be strong to fight the bad guy, Ravana, who took Sita." He told Rama to wait until the rainy season was over.  Then they could go find Sita.

Rama listened to Lakshmana. He knew Lakshmana was right.  Rama promised to be brave and wait for the right time to fight Ravana. He knew Sugriva would help them.  They would wait for the autumn, and then they would rescue Sita!
