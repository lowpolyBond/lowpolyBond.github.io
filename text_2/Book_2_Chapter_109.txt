Once upon a time, a wise man named Javali tried to convince Prince Rama to stay home and become king.  He said, "Rama, don't go to the forest! It's silly!"

But Rama was a good and honest prince. He said, "No, Javali.  My father promised I'd go.  I promised too!  Being honest is very important. It's like a strong tree that helps us reach heaven."

Javali tried again. He said, "Being king is better than being honest! You can be happy and powerful!"

But Rama said, "Being honest makes me happy and strong.  It's what the gods and good people want.  Lying is like a poisonous snake â€“ scary and bad."

Rama explained that good people always tell the truth.  They are kind, brave, and help others.  They follow the rules, like a good game.  He said being truthful is like a magic key that opens the door to heaven.

Javali then admitted, "Rama, I was only testing you! I wanted to see if you were truly good."

Rama was happy to hear this.  He knew he had made the right choice to be honest and go to the forest. He was a kind and brave prince, and he knew that being true to his word was more important than anything else.  He kept his promise to his father and went to live in the forest.
