Rama was amazed! He bowed to the wise Rishi Agastya and asked, "Great Rishi, when the evil Ravana started causing trouble, weren't there any brave warriors to stop him?  Didn't anyone fight back?"

The Rishi smiled.  "Ravana was very powerful," he said. "He went to the city of Mahishmati, a beautiful city, ruled by King Arjuna.  Arjuna was brave and strong, like fire itself!  Butâ€¦Arjuna wasn't there that day."

Ravana asked Arjuna's advisors, "Where is King Arjuna? I, Ravana, have come to fight him!"

The advisors said Arjuna was away. So Ravana went to the Vindhya mountains.  These mountains were HUGE, like a giant cloud touching the sky!  Animals lived there, and beautiful creatures danced and played.  Rivers flowed through them.

Ravana then reached the Narmada River.  It was a wonderful river! Animals drank from it, and birds sang.  Ravana thought it was even more beautiful than the Ganges River!

He got out of his flying chariot and sat on the riverbank.  He told his friends, "This river is so nice and cool!  Let's all take a bath!"

Ravana and his friends, Prahasta, Shuka, Sarana, and others, jumped into the river.  They splashed and played, like happy elephants.

After their bath, they gathered beautiful flowers.  They made a big pile of flowers! Then, Ravana prayed to Lord Shiva.  He offered flowers and sang prayers.  He was happy and peaceful by the river.
