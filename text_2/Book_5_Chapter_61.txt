Hanuman and his monkey friends, led by Angada, heard a great plan!  They zoomed down from Mahendra Mountain, fast and strong like elephants! They were going to help Rama.

They rushed to Madhuvana, a beautiful garden guarded by Sugriva's uncle, Dadhimukha.  The garden was full of sweet honey and yummy fruit.  The monkeys asked nicely, and Sugriva said, "Okay, you can have some!"

The monkeys climbed the trees.  They ate and ate!  They got a little silly from all the sweet honey. They sang, danced, and played!  Some monkeys even tumbled and fought playfully.  They were having so much fun!

But they got a little too wild! They knocked over trees and pulled off all the flowers and leaves.  Dadhimukha, the guard, got very angry. He tried to stop them. But the playful monkeys were too busy! They didn't listen to him.  They even hurt Dadhimukha!

The monkeys were so excited and full of honey, they didn't even realize they were making a mess. They wrecked the whole garden!  Poor Dadhimukha!
