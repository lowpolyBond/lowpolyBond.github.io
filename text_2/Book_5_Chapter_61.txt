Note from Griffith:

Three Cantos consisting of little but repetitions are omitted. Dadhimukh
escapes from the infuriated monkeys and hastens to Sugríva to report their
misconduct. Sugríva infers that Hanumán and his band have been successful
in their search, and that the exuberance of spirits and the mischief
complained of, are but the natural expression of their joy. Dadhimukh
obtains little sympathy from Sugríva, and is told to return and send the
monkeys on with all possible speed.
