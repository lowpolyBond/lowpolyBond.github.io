Hanuman, a clever monkey who could change his shape, went to Lanka.  He wanted to find Sita, Rama's wife.  Lanka was a huge city with a sparkling wall, like a sun!  Scary demons guarded it, like lions guarding a forest.

Hanuman saw a wonderful palace! It was made of silver and gold.  Lots of elephants, strong warriors, and fast chariots were there.  The palace was full of precious stones and comfy chairs.  Beautiful women wore jingling jewelry.

Hanuman explored! He visited many homes of the demons, like Prahasta, Kumbhakarna, and many more.  He bounced from one house to another, checking them all out!

Finally, he reached King Ravana's palace.  It was HUGE!  He saw scary demon women with weapons.  There were super-fast horses and giant elephants â€“ even bigger than Airavata, the king's elephant!

The palace was full of gold chariots, beautiful paintings, and lots and lots of treasures.  It was so shiny and full of jewels, it looked like the sun!  The palace sounded amazing, with drums, cymbals, and happy people.  It was truly Lanka's best jewel!  Hanuman knew he was close to finding Sita.
