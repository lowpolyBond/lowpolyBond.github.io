Bharata was sad, but he was ready to go home. He took Rama's sandals from an elephant's head.  He put them on his own head and climbed into his chariot.  His friends and advisors went with him. They drove around a mountain called Cittrakuta. Then they went east, following a river.  They saw lots of shiny rocks!

Soon, they saw a wise man's house.  His name was Bharadvaja. Bharata stopped his chariot and went to greet him.  Bharadvaja asked, "Did you see Rama? Did you bring him back?"

Bharata said, "No.  I asked Rama to come home, but he said he had to stay in the forest for fourteen years. That's what his father wanted."

Then, Vasishtha, another wise man, said to Rama, "Rama, please give your sandals to Bharata."  Rama did what Vasishtha said. He gave Bharata his special sandals.

Bharata said sadly, "I couldn't bring Rama home. I'm going back to Ayodhya with his sandals."

Bharadvaja smiled. He said, "Bharata, you are a wonderful prince! Your father, King Dasaratha, is lucky to have a son like you."

Bharata bowed to Bharadvaja and then went home. His army followed.  Some rode elephants, some rode horses, and some rode in carts pulled by oxen. They crossed a river called the Yamuna, and then the big river Ganga.

They reached Ayodhya, their city.  Bharata looked around. The city was sad and empty. His father, King Dasaratha, and his brother, Rama, were gone.  Bharata was very, very sad. He said to his driver, "Look how empty and quiet Ayodhya is! It used to be so happy and full of life."
