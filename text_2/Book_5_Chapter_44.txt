Jambumalin, a giant warrior with big teeth, was sent to fight.  He looked scary! He wore shiny clothes and jewelry, and his bow was as strong as the god Indra's.  When he pulled his bow back, it sounded like thunder!

Hanuman, a strong monkey, saw Jambumalin coming in his donkey cart. Hanuman cheered loudly!  Jambumalin shot many sharp arrows.  They hit Hanuman's face, head, and arms.  Even though he was hurt, Hanuman's face shone like a red cloud in the sun.

Angry, Hanuman picked up a huge rock and threw it at Jambumalin!  Jambumalin shot more arrows, and the rock broke.  Then, Hanuman pulled up a whole tree and swung it around! Jambumalin shot so many arrows, he cut the tree to pieces and hurt Hanuman more.

Hanuman was really mad now! He grabbed a big club and swung it so hard it smashed Jambumalin's chariot, his donkey, and even Jambumalin himself!  Jambumalin fell to the ground like a big tree that had been cut down.

King Ravana heard that Jambumalin was dead and got very, very angry!  He shouted for his other strong warriors to attack!
