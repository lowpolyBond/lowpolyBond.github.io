Once upon a time, a brave monkey delivered a message to King Ravana.  Ravana, the powerful king of the demons, was very angry! He wanted to kill the monkey right away.

But Ravana's brother, Vibhishana, was a kind and wise man. He said, "Brother, don't kill the messenger!  It's not fair.  It's against the rules.  Kings don't kill messengers."

Ravana shouted, "He's a bad guy! Killing bad guys isn't wrong!"

Vibhishana explained, "Even if he's bad, killing a messenger is wrong. We can punish him other ways – like whipping him or shaving his head. But killing him is not right.  It's not the best way to handle things.  Let's focus on the monkey's masters—that's where our anger should go!  If we kill this monkey, no one else will come to talk to us. We need to get our revenge on those who sent the monkey."

Ravana thought about what his brother said. Vibhishana said we shouldn't kill him, because the army wants to fight Ravana and killing the monkey would stop that from happening.  He realized his brother was right!  Ravana was a great and powerful king, but he was also a smart one. He listened to his brother's wise words.  He decided not to kill the monkey.
