Hanuman told Rama everything Sita had said.  She told him about a scary thing that happened!

"One day," Hanuman said, "Sita woke up first. A crow pecked her chest! Rama was sleeping, and the crow hurt her again.  She woke Rama up, all bloody."

Rama was very angry! He saw the crow, and it was super fast!  He threw some special grass at it, like a magic weapon! The crow was scared and flew away, but Rama made the crow lose one eye. Then he let it go.

Then Sita said, "Rama is so strong, why doesn't he fight the mean Ravana?  Lakshmana should help too! Why have they forgotten me?"  She felt very sad and alone.

Hanuman told Sita, "Don't worry! Rama and Lakshmana are very sad you're gone.  They'll rescue you very soon! They'll defeat Ravana and bring you home!"

Sita gave Hanuman a special jewel from her hair, a secret sign for Rama.  She was crying, so sad to see Hanuman go.  She said, "You're lucky! You'll see Rama and Lakshmana again!"

Hanuman said, "Hop on my back! I'll take you to them now!"

But Sita said, "No, that's not right.  Just tell them how sad and lonely I am, and how mean Ravana was.  Please hurry!"  

Then Hanuman promised to go quickly and bring help. He knew Sita was telling the truth.
