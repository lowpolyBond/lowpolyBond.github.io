Shurpanakha, a mean giantess, saw Rama, a very strong prince, kill many, many giants in battle.  She was scared!  Rama was super strong!  She ran all the way to Lanka, her brother Ravana's city.

Ravana was a HUGE giant with ten heads and twenty arms! He sat on a golden throne, shiny and bright like a fire.  He was super powerful and had won many battles against gods and other giants.  He even stole things from the gods!  He was strong enough to move mountains! He had been hurt before, but he never gave up.

Shurpanakha saw her brother. Ravana looked powerful and scary, like a giant mountain! He wore lots of shiny jewelry. He looked like the boss of all giants.

Shurpanakha was very afraid. Rama had hurt her badly!  She trembled as she went to tell Ravana what happened.  She showed him her hurt face.  She was ready to tell him all about the super strong Rama.
