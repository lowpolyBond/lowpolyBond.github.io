King Dasaratha had died.  A powerful god, Mahendra, spoke to Rama.  "Rama," he said, "you are brave!  Ask for anything you want!"

Rama was kind. He didn't ask for riches. He said, "Many monkeys fought for me.  They even died!  Please bring them back to life.  They left their families to help me. I want them all to be happy and healthy again."

Rama also wanted there to be lots of food and water for the monkeys.  He wanted the trees to have fruits and flowers, even if it wasn't the right season!

Mahendra, the god, said, "That's a big wish, Rama, but I will do it!"  POOF!  All the monkeys who had died came back to life! They were healthy and strong.  They were so surprised!

The other gods were happy.  They told Rama, "Go home, Rama! See your wife, Sita, and your brother, Bharata. They miss you!  Become king and make your people happy!"

The gods went back to heaven in their shiny chariots. Rama and his brother, Lakshmana, got their monkey army ready to go home.  The monkeys were so happy, they looked like bright stars in the night sky!
