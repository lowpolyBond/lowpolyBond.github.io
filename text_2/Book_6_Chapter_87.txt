Vibhishana, a good giant, helped Lakshmana, a brave prince.  They went deep into a forest. Vibhishana showed Lakshmana a big, scary tree.

"Indrajit, Ravana's son, does his magic here," said Vibhishana. "He becomes invisible and hurts his enemies.  Lakshmana, shoot him before he reaches that tree!"

Lakshmana said, "I will!" He got ready to fight.

Indrajit, Ravana's son, arrived in a fiery chariot. He looked strong and scary! Lakshmana challenged him to a fight.

Indrajit was angry. He shouted at Vibhishana, "Why are you helping the enemy, Uncle? You're a bad giant! You left your family!  That's not right!"

Vibhishana answered, "Indrajit, I'm not a bad giant. Your father, Ravana, is wicked! He's mean and cruel.  He hurts good people and gods. I left him because he's wrong.  It's better to be good than to be with a bad person."

Vibhishana warned Indrajit, "You and your father will lose this fight!  You’re trapped!  Fight Lakshmana!  But if you get near that tree, you’ll die!"
