In that thicket, Vibhishaṇ led the way,
Guiding Lakshmana to where they'd lay.
He pointed to a banyan tree, dark and grim,
And spoke of a ritual awaiting him.

"After spirits are pleased at this sacred place,
Indrajit proceeds to the battle's embrace.
He becomes invisible before his grand fight,
But you must strike swiftly, with all your might.

Destroy Indrajit, his chariot and his might,
Before he reaches that banyan tree's sight,"
Lakshmana nodded, bow drawn to defend,
To follow Vibhishaṇ's counsel, he'd intend.

Indrajit, clad in armor, fiery chariot in tow,
A scion of Sage Paulastya, a formidable foe.
Lakshmana challenged, "Come, let us engage,
In battle, as warriors, on this world's stage."

But Indrajit, with brilliance in his eye,
Saw Vibhishaṇ and began to imply,
"You, demon-born, brother to my kin,
Why turn against us? What's the reason within?

Family ties, you seem to disregard,
Choosing enemies, it's truly quite hard.
You leave your own kindred, your blood and race,
For the sake of our foes, it's a grave disgrace."

Vibhishaṇ replied with patience and grace,
"My nature is goodness, it's not a race.
I value virtue and act with care,
Though born a demon, it's love I bear.

I shun cruel deeds and seek what's right,
Abandoning evil, embracing the light.
In a world of strife, where good is rare,
A brother's heart, I choose to share."

"Your words are harsh, but I remain true,
Respect for elders, I hold that too.
Though we may differ, I stay by your side,
Our bonds of blood, I'll never hide.

Abandoning one's kin, 'tis a grievous sin,
I won't cast aside, even if I win.
Despite my demon birth, I won't be swayed,
By a brother's love, I'm firmly stayed."

"Evil deeds bring about our own decline,
To happiness and virtue, they draw no line.
Avoid the wicked, their path is dire,
Like a venomous snake, poised to strike fire.

Three faults, they bring utter destruction,
Stealing others' wealth, a vile seduction.
Lusting for another's spouse, a dark blight,
Excessive distrust, brings eternal night."

"Such faults have obscured our brother's grace,
Ravana's virtues hidden, lost in the chase.
His arrogance, anger, and endless fights,
Have veiled his goodness, like clouds obscure heights.

Because of these vices, my choice is clear,
Ravana and his city shall disappear.
Lanka's end is near, as fate decides,
For you and your father, pride overrides."

"Speak as you will, with arrogance bold,
Foolish and indisciplined, your story unfolds.
You're ensnared by Death, your doom you chase,
Today's harsh words sealed your fate's embrace.

You'll never reach that banyan tree's hold,
Nor survive, as Lakshmana's strength takes its toll.
Fight him if you dare, in this battlefield's wake,
But today, with your army, you'll meet your fate.

Exhaust your weapons, show your might,
In Lakshmana's range, you won't see the light.
With your army, today, you won't return,
For Lakshmana's arrows, fierce and swift, shall burn."
