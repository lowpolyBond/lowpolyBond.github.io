Once upon a time, a giant named Kumbhakarna, who was a brother of the wicked king Ravana, slept a very, very long sleep.  A magical sleep put him to rest, and his family built him a super-duper amazing palace to sleep in.  It was HUGE, with shiny crystal pillars and floors made of diamonds! Kumbhakarna slept for thousands of years in that beautiful palace.

While Kumbhakarna slept, his brother Ravana was very naughty.  He was mean to everyone! He scared the gods, the wise people, and even messed up their beautiful gardens. He was like a giant, angry elephant stomping everything in his path!

A kind god, worried about Ravana, sent a message to Ravana’s brother, Vibhishana, asking him to tell Ravana to stop being so mean.  Vibhishana brought the messenger to Ravana.

The messenger told Ravana that his brother, Kumbhakarna, had made friends with a powerful god after doing lots of good deeds. Kumbhakarna asked Ravana to be good, to stop hurting everyone, and to be kind. He told Ravana that the gods were angry and wanted to punish him.

Ravana got very, very angry!  He didn’t listen! He thought the message was a trick. He didn't believe his brother or the messenger.  He was so mad, he killed the messenger!  Then, he jumped in his chariot, ready to fight everyone! He wanted to be even meaner and conquer the whole world!
