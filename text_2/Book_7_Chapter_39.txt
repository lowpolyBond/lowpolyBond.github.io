After defeating Ravana, Prince Rama's army went home.  Lots of kings had helped Rama fight, riding on their big elephants and horses!  They were a little sad they didn't get to fight Ravana themselves. They said, "We arrived too late! We would have helped defeat the bad guys!"

These happy kings rode home to their beautiful kingdoms, full of silver and gold.  They wanted to thank Rama, so they sent him lots of amazing gifts!  They sent him sparkling jewels, strong elephants, fancy chariots, beautiful clothes, and even some special slave girls!

Bharata, Lakshmana, and Shatrughna brought all the gifts back to Ayodhya, the beautiful city.  Rama was so happy!  He shared the gifts with his friends – Sugriva, the monkey king, Vibhishana, and all the other monkeys and giants who had helped him. The monkeys put the jewels on their heads and arms, and they looked so sparkly!

Rama picked up his best monkey friends, Hanuman and Angada, and hugged them. He said, "Hanuman and Angada, you were so brave and smart! You deserve these special jewels!"  Rama gave them some of his most beautiful necklaces.

Then, Rama thanked all his other monkey friends – Nila, Nala, and many, many more! He said, "You are my friends, my brothers! You saved me!  I'm so happy to have you!" He gave each of them wonderful gifts, too.

The monkeys and giants had a big party!  They ate sweet honey and delicious food. They stayed in Ayodhya for a whole month, but it felt like just an hour because they were having so much fun with Rama!  Everyone was happy, and the second month of autumn flew by quickly.
