King Ravana was very proud.  A brave monkey named Sarana spoke to him.  Sarana asked Ravana to give back Sita.

Ravana laughed. "Even if all the gods and demons attacked me," he boomed, "I wouldn't give Sita back! You monkeys are scared, that's why you ask!"  He was so angry!

Ravana climbed up to his shiny white palace, as tall as many, many palm trees. He looked out at the army of monkeys.  He was amazed! There were so many!

"Who are these monkeys?" he asked Sarana. "Who are their leaders?"

Sarana pointed to different monkeys.  "That's General Nila!" he said. "He's HUGE and his roar shakes the whole city!"

Then Sarana pointed to another monkey.  "That's Angada," he explained. "He's strong and brave. He's like a mountain, and he wants to fight you!"

Sarana told Ravana about many other monkey generals:  Nala, who built a bridge; Shveta, who was very fast; Kumuda, who ruled his own kingdom; Kanda, with his scary-looking army; Rambha, who was surrounded by tons of monkeys; Sharabha, who never ran away; Panasa, whose voice was like a drum; Vinata, who drank from the Vena river; and Gavaya, who was very strong and red.

Sarana said, "There are so many brave monkey warriors!  It's an army too big to count!"
