King Janaka sent some messengers to Ayodhya, a long journey away.  They rode in fast chariots, but it still took three nights!  Their horses were very tired.

When they arrived, they went to the palace. "Tell the king that messengers from King Janaka are here," they said to the guards.

King Dasaratha heard the news.  He invited the messengers inside.  The king was very old and kind, like a god. The messengers felt comfortable.

They told the king, "King Janaka, who lives in Mithila, sends his best wishes. He's very happy because your son, Rama, is going to marry his daughter!  Many kings tried, but only Rama could break the magical bow. King Janaka wants you to come to Mithila for the wedding.  He asks you to bring your family and teachers."  They added, "This is a message from King Janaka, and Sage Vishvamitra and Priest Shatananda agree."

The messengers were a little shy in front of the great king, so they stopped talking.

King Dasaratha was so happy! He told his wise teachers, Sage Vasishtha and Sage Vamadeva, and his helpers, "Rama and Lakshmana are in Mithila with Sage Vishvamitra!  King Janaka wants Rama to marry his daughter. What do you think?"

The wise people said, "It's a wonderful idea!"

King Dasaratha smiled. "Let's leave for Mithila tomorrow!"

He treated the messengers kindly and they slept well in the palace that night.
