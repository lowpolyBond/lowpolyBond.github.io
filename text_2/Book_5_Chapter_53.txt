Hanuman, a brave monkey, was caught by the ten-headed demon king, Ravana.  Ravana's brother suggested a punishment:  set Hanuman's tail on fire!

The demons wrapped Hanuman's tail in oily rags and lit them.  The fire grew big and bright! Hanuman was angry, but he didn't fight back. He knew he was there to help his friend, Rama.  He thought, "I'm strong, I could fight, but I'll wait. I'll see more of Lanka."

They dragged Hanuman through the city.  Everyone came to watch.  The demons shouted, "This is a spy!"  The demon women told Sita, Rama's wife, who was held captive.

Sita was sad.  She prayed to the fire god, "Please protect this monkey! Please help him!"

Suddenly, the fire didn't hurt Hanuman!  His father, the Wind God, blew cool air on his tail.  Hanuman was amazed. He knew it was because of Sita's prayers, Rama's power, and his father's love.

Hanuman thought, "I should fight!" He broke his bonds.  He was super strong!  He jumped high and escaped the city gates. He found a big iron bar and used it to fight the guards.  Then, he looked all around Lanka, ready for anything.
