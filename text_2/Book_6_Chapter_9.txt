Ravana's strong army, full of brave warriors like Rabhasa, Suryashatru, and many others, were all very angry.  They shouted, "Today, we'll defeat Rama, Lakshmana, Sugriva, and that naughty monkey Hanuman who wrecked Lanka!"

But Bibishana, Ravana's kind brother, stopped them. He said, "Wait!  Fighting Rama is a bad idea.  He's strong and lucky.  Remember when Hanuman crossed the ocean?  It was amazing! Rama has many soldiers. We shouldn't fight him."

Bibishana explained, "Rama only fights when he has to. He didn't do anything wrong.  He's just trying to get Sita back. Remember what happened to Khara? He tried to take land that wasn't his, and Rama fought him. It's the same here.  Ravana took Sita."

"Let's give Sita back," Bibishana pleaded. "It's the best way to avoid a big war.  Rama is powerful! His arrows are sharp and fast.  If we don't return Sita, he will destroy Lanka!"

Bibishana begged his brother, "Please, let's be peaceful! Let's give Sita back to Rama and everyone can be happy."

Ravana listened to Bibishana, sent his army away, and went to his room to think.
