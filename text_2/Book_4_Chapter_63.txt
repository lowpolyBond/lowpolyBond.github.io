Once upon a time, a wise old hermit helped a sad monkey named Sampati.  The hermit gave him good advice and told him to be brave. Sampati crawled out of a cave and waited a very, very long time â€“ a whole hundred years!  He was very sad and missed his family.  He almost gave up, but remembered the hermit's words and stayed strong.

Sampati told some other monkeys about his troubles.  He said, "I saw my son. He didn't rescue Sita, even though she was very sad and alone!" Sampati was upset because his son hadn't helped Sita.

Suddenly, something amazing happened! Sampati's wings grew back!  A powerful magic had healed him.  He was so happy! He told the monkeys, "My wings are back!  This means we will find Sita!"

Sampati flew to the top of a mountain to test his new wings. The monkeys were excited.  They knew they could find Sita now!  They were strong and brave.  They zoomed off to the south, super fast, ready to find Sita and bring her home.
