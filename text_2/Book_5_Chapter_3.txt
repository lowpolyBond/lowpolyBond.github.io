Hanuman, a super-strong monkey, flew to Lanka.  Lanka was a beautiful city with sparkling palaces, shining like clouds!  It had amazing gardens, and the sound of the ocean nearby.  It was guarded by Ravana, a powerful king.

Hanuman saw giant golden gates, walls of sparkling gems, and floors made of pretty stones.  Peacocks and swans lived in Lanka's lakes.  Everywhere, he heard drums and bells!  He was amazed!

Hanuman thought, "This city is super strong!  Only the strongest monkeys could get in!" But then he remembered his friends and Rama, his brave leader.  He felt brave again.

As Hanuman walked in, a giant woman blocked his way.  She was Lanka itself, guarding the city!  She roared, "Stop! You can't enter!"

Hanuman asked, "Who are you?  Why are you so angry?"

The woman said, "I am Lanka!  I protect the city for King Ravana. No one gets past me!"

Hanuman said, "I just want to look around."

The woman got even angrier.  She tried to stop him, but Hanuman gently pushed her away.  He didn't want to hurt her.

The woman, Lanka, cried out.  Then, she spoke softly.  "You've defeated me," she said. "An old prophecy said that when a monkey defeats me, Ravana will be defeated!  Go and find Sita!"

So, Hanuman, the brave monkey, entered Lanka to find Rama's wife, Sita.
