Once upon a time, there was a baby monkey named Hanuman.  His dad, the Wind God, was very sad because Hanuman seemed to be dead.

The Wind God rushed to Brahma, the creator god, and begged him for help.  Brahma, a kind god who knew all, gently touched the baby.  Just like magic, Hanuman came back to life!

The Wind God was so happy! He blew a big, happy breeze all over the world.  Everyone felt better, like flowers blooming after a cold wind stopped.

Brahma told all the other gods, "This baby is very special! He'll do great things. Give him gifts!"

The god of thunder gave Hanuman a special gift: he'd never be hurt by lightning!  The sun god gave him some of his own bright light.  The water god said Hanuman would never drown.  Other gods gave him even more amazing gifts –  protection from weapons and sickness!

Brahma, the creator god, said, "Hanuman will be strong and brave. He’ll help Rama, a very important prince, defeat a bad king!"

Hanuman grew up very strong, but he was also very playful.  He was so strong that he didn't even know how strong he was! He accidentally messed up the homes of some wise people called Rishis.  They were a little angry, and they gave Hanuman a special curse.  He forgot how strong he was!

Hanuman was friends with Sugriva, another monkey.  Sugriva's uncle, Bali, was a very mean monkey king. Hanuman helped Sugriva fight against Bali, but he didn't know his own strength until later.

Hanuman was very smart. He even went to the sun god to learn how to read and write!  He became very, very wise.

The gods had made Hanuman strong and smart so he could help Rama. He would be a great hero!  Rama was very impressed with Hanuman’s story.

Then, Rama's wise friend told Rama all about Hanuman's childhood and the important gifts he received, leaving Rama amazed.  The wise friend went home, and Rama went to sleep.
