Rama and Ravana were fighting a big battle!  Ravana, a powerful demon king, was very angry. He shot many, many arrows at Rama.  It was like a huge rain of arrows! But Rama was strong and brave. He dodged most of them.

Then Ravana got even angrier. He shot even more arrows!  Rama was covered in blood, but he didn't give up.  He looked like a beautiful tree with lots of red flowers.

Rama shouted, "You kidnapped my wife Sita! You're not a hero! You're a coward!  You took her away when she was all alone.  Today, I will defeat you!"

Rama was very angry. He shot so many arrows at Ravana.  He said, "Today, I will kill you!  The birds will eat your body!"

Ravana was hurt badly.  He was so scared!  His chariot driver saw how hurt Ravana was.  He quickly drove the chariot away from the battle. Ravana was defeated!
