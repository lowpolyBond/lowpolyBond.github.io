Rama's army was HUGE!  It looked like a sparkling full moon in a dark sky.  The ground shook as so many monkeys marched!

Deep in the forest, the monkeys heard a loud noise from Lanka –  banging drums and crashing cymbals!  It made their fur stand on end! But the monkey leaders were happy. They cheered even louder than the drums! Their shouts were like thunder.

Rama saw Lanka, the city of Ravana, all decorated with bright flags. He thought of Sita, his wife, and felt very sad. Sita was trapped in Lanka, just like the moon is caught by the sun.

Rama sighed. He looked at Lakshmana, his brother.  "Look, Lakshmana!" he said. "See Lanka!  It’s a beautiful city. It looks like a magical palace in the sky!  It's full of trees, flowers, and birds singing!"

Rama told his monkey army what to do.  "Angada and Nila will be in the center," he said. "Rishabha on the right, and Gandhamadana on the left.  Lakshmana and I will lead the charge! Jambavan, Sushena, and Vegadarshin will be our spies."  The bears would protect the middle and back.

The monkey army was ready. They carried rocks and big trees. They looked like a huge, dark cloud moving towards Lanka. "We'll smash Lanka with mountains!" they roared. "Or with our bare hands!"

Rama told Sugriva, his friend, "Our army is ready. Let's free Shuka!"

Shuka was a spy for Ravana, the king of Lanka.  The monkeys caught and beat him.  Scared and hurt, Shuka ran to Ravana.

"What happened to you?" Ravana asked, looking mean.

"The monkeys beat me up!" cried Shuka. "Rama is here! He wants Sita back. His army is enormous!  It's like mountains and clouds!  You need to give Sita back to him, or fight!"

Ravana's eyes got red with anger. "I will NEVER give Sita back!" he shouted. "I’m stronger than anyone!  Rama doesn't know how strong I am! I'll defeat him easily!"  Ravana was very proud and didn't want to give Sita back.
