King Dasaratha, a very old king, loved his people. He talked to his advisors, his voice like a strong drum but also very kind.  He said, "I've ruled for a very long time. I'm tired.  My son, Rama, is strong and good. He's the best person to rule now."

The advisors all shouted, "Yes! That's wonderful!"  They were so happy!  The palace shook with their cheers.

The wise men and the leaders all agreed. They said, "Rama is perfect! He's kind, brave, and fair. He deserves to be king!" They wanted to see Rama become the prince who rules in his father's place.

King Dasaratha wanted to make sure they really meant it. He asked, "Why do you want Rama to be king? Have I been a bad ruler?"

The advisors explained, "Rama is the best! He's honest and brave like the god Indra. He's wise like a great teacher. He helps everyone, even his enemies. He’s kind to everyone and always tells the truth. He’s the best archer, and the best at everything.  He cares about everyone, like a loving parent cares for their children. He’s as wonderful as the moon!"

They went on and on about how wonderful Rama was.  They said he was the perfect king, and everyone loved him.

King Dasaratha was so proud. He agreed to make Rama the new ruler, and everyone rejoiced!
