Rama was ready to go fight bad guys in the Dandaka forest.  His wife, Sita, was worried.  She said, "Rama, you're a good king, but even good people can make mistakes. There are three bad things: lying, being mean to someone else's wife, and hurting people without a reason."

Sita said, "You never lie.  And you would never even think about being mean to another woman.  But you are going to fight, and that worries me."

She told Rama about a story. A holy man lived in the forest.  The god Indra gave him a sword to keep safe. But the holy man carried the sword all the time. He started to like fighting. He became mean and went to a bad place after he died.

Sita said, "Rama, carrying weapons makes people want to fight! You’re going to the forest with your bow and arrows.  That makes you want to fight.  It’s better to be peaceful."

"It’s better to protect people who are in danger, not just fight.  Fighting and being peaceful are opposites.  When you return home, you can fight again. For now, let's focus on peace.  This will make my parents happy too. Doing your duty is the most important thing. True happiness doesn't come from pleasure, but from doing what is right."

Sita said, "I know you're wise, but I'm worried. I'm just your wife, so please forgive me if I’m wrong.  Think about what I said and do what you think is best."
