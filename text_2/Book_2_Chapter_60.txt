Queen Kaushalya was so sad!  She felt like she was going to die.  She told Sumantra, her driver, "Take me to Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita! I can't live without them!"

Sumantra was sad too. He tried to comfort her.  "Don't worry, Queen," he said. "Rama is happy in the forest. Lakshmana is with him, and they're doing good things. Sita is also happy.  She loves Rama so much that the forest feels like home to her. She's exploring, looking at trees and rivers, and asking Rama about everything." Sumantra forgot to mention what Kaikeyi had done. He didn't want to make the Queen even sadder.

Sumantra said, "Sita is beautiful. The forest hasn't changed her.  She still wears her pretty jewelry, and her anklets jingle as she walks. She's not afraid of the animals, because she trusts Rama."

He told the Queen, "Don't worry! Rama is doing what his father asked. Everyone will admire him for being so good."

Even though Sumantra tried to cheer her up, Queen Kaushalya still cried, "My darling Rama! My son!"  She missed him very much.
