Lakshmana asked Rama, "Rama, why did those angry holy men curse King Nriga?  It was just for a little fruit!"

Rama said, "Lakshmana, let me tell you.  After the holy men left, King Nriga called everyone together. He said, 'The holy men cursed me!  My son, Vasu, will be the new king.  Please build me three special ditches. One will keep me dry, one will keep me warm, and one will keep me cool. Make it pretty, with lots of trees and flowers!'

So they built the ditches.  King Nriga made Vasu king. He told his son, 'Be a good king, my son. Don't be sad for me. This is what happens because of what we did in our past lives.  Everything happens for a reason.'

Then King Nriga went down into the beautiful ditch and lived there until the curse was over."
