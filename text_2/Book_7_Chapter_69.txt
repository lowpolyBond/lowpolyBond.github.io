Shatrughna, a brave prince, fought a mean giant named Lavana.  Lavana was angry! He shouted and hit Shatrughna hard.

Shatrughna fought back.  "I wasn't even born when you hurt others," he said. "But today, *I* will defeat you! Everyone will see you die!"

Lavana was furious! He threw a HUGE tree at Shatrughna.  But Shatrughna easily chopped it to pieces with his arrows! Lavana threw more trees, but Shatrughna chopped them all up too!

Lavana laughed and hit Shatrughna so hard he fell down!  Everyone gasped.  Lavana thought Shatrughna was dead. He didn't even look for his special weapon. He just went to get food!

But Shatrughna wasn't dead! He jumped up, grabbed his arrow, and ran back to the city gate.  He had a super special arrow! It shone so bright, it looked like lightning!  Even the gods were scared!

They asked Brahma, the great god, what was happening. Brahma said, "Don't worry! That arrow is magic! It's going to defeat Lavana!"

Shatrughna roared like a lion and aimed his super arrow.  Lavana shot his arrow too, but Shatrughna's arrow was much stronger. It went right through Lavana and back to Shatrughna!  Lavana fell down dead.

Everyone cheered! The gods, the fairies, and even the magic snakes were happy.  Lavana, the scary giant, was finally defeated! Shatrughna was a hero!
