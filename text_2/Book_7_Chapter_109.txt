One morning, as the sun peeked over the hills, Prince Rama, strong and handsome, told his wise teacher, Vasishtha, "Let's go on our journey!  The holy fire and the special tent should go first, and you, my teacher, should lead the way."

Vasishtha did all the special prayers for a safe journey. Then Rama, dressed in beautiful clothes, said special words and prayers. He carried some holy grass. He walked barefoot, shining like the sun!  Goddess Lakshmi, the goddess of luck, walked beside him, holding a lotus flower.  Another goddess, the Earth Goddess, walked on his other side.  His magical bow and arrows walked with him too, like they were people!  Even the holy sounds from the prayers and wise teachers followed him.  It was like everyone and everything good was walking with him!

Rama's family and friends followed close behind: his brothers Bharata and Shatrughna, his servants, even the animals and birds! Everyone was happy. The monkeys chattered excitedly, saying, "Kilakila!" to show their joy.

Nobody was sad.  Everyone was so happy to see Rama, that people from all the towns and villages joined the procession. Even bears and monkeys joined him! It was like a huge, happy party!  Everyone wanted to be with Rama as he started his journey.  Everyone followed him, even invisible beings!  In the end, Ayodhya was almost empty, because everyone had gone with Rama!
