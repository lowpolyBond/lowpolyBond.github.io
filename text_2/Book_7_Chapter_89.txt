Rama was telling a wonderful story! Lakshmana and Bharata listened, saying, "Wow!"

Rama said, "Long ago, there was a king named Ila.  One day, Ila was all alone in the forest.  A handsome prince named Budha found her. Budha was the son of the moon god!  He smiled and said, 'I love you, Ila!'"

Ila smiled back and said, "I love you too!"  Budha and Ila spent a happy month together.

Then, Ila woke up and said, "Where are my people?"

Budha said, "A big storm came and blew them away. Don't worry!"

Ila was sad. "I miss my kingdom! My son Shashabindu will rule in my place, but I must go back!"

Budha said, "Stay a little longer.  I'll give you a wish at the end of the year."

Ila stayed.  Something amazing happened! Ila changed from a man to a woman, and back again!  Then, Ila had a baby boy!  His name was Pururavas. Ila gave the baby to Budha to look after.  Pururavas looked just like Budha!"
