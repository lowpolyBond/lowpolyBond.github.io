Prince Bharata rode into Ayodhya in his loud chariot.  The city was sad and quiet.  All the doors were closed. It was dark and gloomy.

The city was like a dry riverbed, with no birds or fish.  It was like a fire that had burned out, leaving only ashes. It was like an army that had lost a battle, with all its soldiers gone. It was like a broken necklace, missing all its pretty gems.  It was like a beautiful tree that had been burned in a fire.

The streets were empty.  The shops were closed.  There was nothing for sale. Ayodhya was like a cloudy night, or an empty party with only broken glass left behind. It was like a dry well with cracked earth around it.  It was like a broken bow, or a tired, old mule.

Bharata looked at the empty city.  He said to his driver, Sumantra, "Ayodhya used to be so happy! It used to smell of flowers and sweet incense.  I donâ€™t hear the horses or elephants anymore. Since Rama left, everyone is sad. They don't wear flowers or celebrate festivals.  Ayodhya is dark, like a cloudy night. When will Rama come back?"

Bharata cried as he went into his father's palace. The palace felt empty without the king. It was like a cave without a lion.  Bharata cried so hard, like the gods cry when the sun goes dark.
