High on a mountain, a group of monkeys were very tired. They were very hungry and weak.  Suddenly, a big vulture landed nearby. This was Sampati, Jatayu's brother.  He was strong and brave, just like Jatayu.

Sampati saw the weak monkeys. He thought, "These monkeys are dying. I'll eat them!"  He was very hungry.

One of the monkeys, Angada, was scared. He whispered to Hanuman, “Look! This vulture is going to eat us!  We're so weak from searching for Sita, Rama's wife.  Jatayu, a brave vulture, died trying to help Sita. We’re trying to help too, but we're failing.  Everything bad that’s happening – King Dasaratha’s death, Sita's kidnapping, even Rama’s fights – it’s all connected.”

Sampati heard Angada's sad words. He was surprised.  He asked, "Who is talking about my brother Jatayu?  I haven't heard his name in a long time!"

Angada explained how Jatayu fought a terrible demon to save Sita. He told Sampati about Jatayu's death and everything that had happened.

Sampati was very sad. His brother meant the world to him. He wanted to know everything.  But he couldn’t fly down easily because the sun had burned his wings.  He asked the monkeys to help him down.  He really wanted to hear the whole story about his brave brother.
