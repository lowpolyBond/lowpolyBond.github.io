King Sugriva sent his best monkey soldiers on a big search.  First, he sent some monkeys east. Then, he sent another group south.  Angada was their brave leader.  This group had super-strong monkeys like Hanuman, Jambavan, and many others.

Sugriva told them where to look.  “You'll see the Vindhya mountains, with lots of trees and the Narmada River.  Then, you'll find the Godavari River, and lots of other places like Mekhalas, Utkala, and Avanti. You'll need to search the Dandaka forest, too.  Look in Andhra, the Chola and Pandya lands, and even Kerala!”

He pointed out more places. "You'll find the Kaveri River and the great Malaya mountain, where the wise Agastya lives.  He will help you cross a river full of crocodiles. Then, look for the Pandya city, with its golden gates.  After that, you must go to the ocean!

"Across the ocean is a big island.  That's where the bad king Ravana lives. He kidnapped Sita!  Be careful!  There's a scary giantess in the ocean who grabs shadows. Find Sita, and come back!"

Sugriva described more faraway places: a beautiful mountain named Mahendra, and then a shining mountain called Pushpitaka. He warned them about other far off mountains too, and a dangerous city guarded by snakes.  "Don't go too far," he said. "The land ends, and then comes a scary place where even death lives!

Sugriva told them, "Find Sita within a month!  The one who brings her back will be my best friend, and we'll all celebrate!"  The monkeys cheered and zoomed off to find Sita!
