One day, Rama, a very brave prince, called everyone to a special gathering.  Lots of important people came: wise teachers, strong warriors, and even playful monkeys!  There were kings and queens, and many, many others.  Everyone was very quiet, waiting to see what would happen.

Ramaâ€™s beautiful wife, Sita, had been accused of doing something wrong.  She was very sad.  A wise old teacher named Valmiki brought Sita to Rama.  Sita walked behind him, her head bowed low, feeling very upset.

When everyone saw Sita, some people cried out, "Poor Sita!" Others shouted, "Long live Rama!" and some shouted for both of them.

Valmiki, the wise teacher, spoke to Rama.  He said, "Rama, this is Sita.  She was living near my home, and she is completely innocent!  She has been wrongly accused.  She has two sons, who are also your sons!"

Valmiki was a very truthful man. He said, "I have lived a long, good life.  If Sita is guilty, may I never have a good life! But she is not guilty.  I know she is innocent. She is a good and pure woman. Rama, you were afraid of what other people would say, but Sita is truly good."

Valmiki explained that he knew Sita was innocent because he is very wise and he knew the truth.  He said that Rama should take Sita back because she was a truly good and honest person.
