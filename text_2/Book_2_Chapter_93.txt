Prince Bharata led a HUGE army through the forest.  It was so big!  Scared animals ran away! Elephants trumpeted and zoomed off.  Bears and leopards scrambled up the hills.  Even the river seemed to worry!

Bharata's army was like a giant ocean, its waves spreading everywhere. Or like dark rain clouds filling the sky!  There were so many elephants and horses, you couldn't even see the ground!

After walking a long, long way, Bharataâ€™s animals got tired.  He looked around and said to his wise teacher, Vasishtha, "This is just like everyone said! This must be Cittrakuta Mountain, and that's the Mandakini River!  See, Guru Vasishtha, those are the amazing Cittrakuta peaks! Even the elephants are walking on them! Look how they knock flowers off the trees, just like rain from dark clouds!"

He turned to his brother, Shatrughna.  "Look at the beautiful Cittrakuta Mountain!  The deer are everywhere, like pretty fish in the sea! They're running from us, making the forest even more beautiful!"

"Our soldiers are wearing flowers in their hair," Bharata said, "just like people from the south!  This scary forest, filled with our army, now feels like home, like Ayodhya!"

The dust from the horses and oxen filled the sky. "The dust is like all the things that are hiding Rama from me," Bharata explained, "but the wind will blow it away!"

Bharata pointed.  "Look, Shatrughna, at those fast horses and chariots! Even the peacocks are running away! This place is so peaceful, perfect for holy people!"

"Look at those deer," Bharata smiled. "They look like flowers dotted across the forest! Let's find Rama and Lakshmana!"

Bharata's soldiers marched into the forest. They saw smoke in the distance! They rushed back to Bharata. "We think Rama and Lakshmana are near where that smoke is! Or maybe it's a holy person who knows where they are!"

Bharata was so happy! He told his army, "Stay here.  Vasishtha, Sumantra, and I will go see."

The army waited. They all smiled. They thought, "We're about to see Rama!"
