Ravana, the ten-headed king, was very sad.  He told his friend Marica, "My dear friend, I need your help! My brother, Khara, and my sister, Shurpanakha, and many other giants lived in a forest.  Rama, a strong man, killed them all!  He even hurt my sister!"

Ravana was angry.  Rama had exiled himself to the forest with his wife, Sita.  Ravana wanted to get revenge. He had a plan.  "I want to take Sita away," he said. "She is beautiful. If Rama loses Sita, he will be very sad."

Ravana had a clever idea.  "Marica," he said, "change into a beautiful golden deer.  Go near Rama and Sita's home.  Sita will want Rama to catch it."

"When Rama and his brother go to catch the deer," Ravana explained, "I will sneak in and take Sita away!"  Marica was scared.  He knew Rama was very strong.  He didn't want to help Ravana, but he was afraid to say no.

Marica was worried. He knew Rama was brave.  He was very scared of Rama, so he looked nervous and his mouth was dry.  He said to Ravana, “I am scared of Rama! He’s too strong! This is a bad idea!”
