Hanuman, a strong monkey, jumped from a tall mountain!  He wanted to meet Rama and Lakshmana, two brothers.  He changed his looks, pretending to be a friendly monk.

He bowed politely and spoke to the brothers. "Great heroes," he said, "you look like gods! Why are you here in the forest, near the sparkling Pampa Lake? You're so brave and strong, like lions!"

Hanuman kept talking, describing how handsome and powerful they were.  He explained, "I'm Hanuman, a monkey, a friend of King Sugriva. Sugriva wants to be friends with you!"

Rama and Lakshmana were impressed.  Rama said to Lakshmana, "This is Sugriva's messenger! He speaks beautifully. He's very smart!"

Lakshmana answered Hanuman, "We know of Sugriva. We'll do whatever he wants."

Hanuman was happy. He knew he could help Sugriva and Rama become friends! He was ready to make a plan.
