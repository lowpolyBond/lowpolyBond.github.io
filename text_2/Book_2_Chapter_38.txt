King Dasaratha was very sad.  He saw Sita, Rama's wife, dressed in simple clothes like a poor person.  Everyone felt sorry for her.  They blamed the king.  King Dasaratha felt terrible.  He talked to his wife, Kaikeyi.

"Kaikeyi," he said, "Sita shouldn't be going to the forest dressed like this!  She's a princess!  She deserves to be happy.  She hasn't done anything wrong! I never promised she would wear such simple clothes. She should wear beautiful jewelry and fine clothes. I'm going to die soon, and I'm so upset!  I made promises I shouldn't have.  It's hurting me terribly.  Rama hasn't done anything to you, and neither has Sita! Why are you so mean to Sita, sheâ€™s so kind and gentle? You are sending Rama away unfairly, and because of this you will suffer greatly.

"You made Rama leave and go to the forest. You even made him wear simple clothes! I didn't say anything, but now it's too late!  Because of you, Sita has to go too. It's all your fault!"

King Dasaratha cried and cried. He was so heartbroken about what happened to his son that he fell to the ground.

Rama saw his father crying.  He was ready to leave for the forest, but he felt sad for his father.  He spoke to his father.

"Father," Rama said, "Please take care of my mother, Kaushalya.  She is very kind.  She will be so sad because I'm leaving.  She needs you now more than ever. Please be good to her and keep her safe while I'm gone."
