King Rama was very sad.  He called everyone together.  "Listen," he said, "people are saying bad things about Sita.  They don't believe she's innocent."

Rama explained what happened.  Ravana, a mean monster, kidnapped Sita. Rama fought and defeated Ravana, and rescued Sita.  To prove her innocence, Sita walked into a big fire!  The fire god, Agni, showed everyone that Sita was good and true.  Many gods and goddesses saw this too.  Rama knew Sita was innocent.

But still, people gossiped.  Rama was very upset by these mean words.  He said, "It's important to be good and honest.  I'm scared of what people will think.  I have to send Sita away."

He asked his brother Lakshmana to take Sita far away, across the river Ganges, to a wise hermit named Valmiki.  "Take her to his peaceful home," Rama said, "It's a sad thing to do, but I must."

Lakshmana was sad too. Rama begged him to obey. He said if Lakshmana didn't do this, he'd be very angry.

Rama's heart was breaking.  He went back to his palace, very, very sad.  He sighed like a big elephant.  He had made a very hard decision.
