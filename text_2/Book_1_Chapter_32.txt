Long ago, there was a good king named Kusha. He was a very kind man who always did what was right. He married a beautiful queen, and they had four strong sons: Kushamba, Kushanabha, Umuritarajasa, and Basu.

King Kusha told his sons, "Be good kings! Take care of your people."  So, each son built a city! Kushamba built Kaushambi. Kushanabha built Mahodaya. Umuritarajasa built Dharmaranya.  And Basu built Giribrat, a beautiful city surrounded by mountains and a sparkling river.

Kushanabha's wife had one hundred beautiful daughters!  They were so pretty, they looked like sparkling stars.  One day, the wind god, Vayu, saw them. He wanted them to marry him and become immortal.

But the princesses said, "No! We will only marry who our father chooses. We are good girls and we follow the rules."

Vayu was angry! He blew a strong wind and made the princesses look strange and twisted.  They cried and ran to their father, Kushanabha.  The king was very sad to see his daughters like that.  His heart was heavy with worry.
