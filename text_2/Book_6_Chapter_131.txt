Bharata, Kaikeyi's son, bowed to his brother Rama.  He said, "Rama, you gave me the kingdom, but I can't rule!  It's too big and too hard. I'm like a small calf trying to carry a giant's load.  I can't rule as well as you."

Bharata explained, "You're like a strong tree with lots of branches.  If you don't rule, we're all like a dried-up tree with no fruit."  He begged Rama, "Please be king! Let everyone celebrate!"

Rama said, "Okay!"

Everyone got ready for Rama's coronation.  Bharata helped Rama get dressed.  Lakshmana got ready too.  Sugriva, the monkey king, and Vibhishana, the demon king, helped as well.  Rama looked amazing in his new clothes!  The monkeys helped too, all dressed up nicely.

The ministers planned the big celebration. They said, "Let's prepare for Rama's coronation! It will be wonderful!"

Rama rode in a beautiful chariot. Bharata held the reins, Shatrughna the umbrella, Lakshmana the fan, and Sugriva and Vibhishana held fly whisks.  Gods and wise men sang beautiful songs about Rama.  Sugriva rode on a huge elephant!

Rama arrived in Ayodhya. Everyone cheered!  The city was decorated beautifully.

Rama told everyone about his friends, Sugriva and Hanuman, the brave monkey. He told them about all the amazing things the monkeys did to help him.

Rama then visited his mothers – Kaushalya, Sumitra, and Kaikeyi – and showed them respect. He asked that Sugriva live in a beautiful palace.

Bharata took Sugriva to the palace.  Shatrughna told Sugriva, "Please help us with Rama’s coronation!"

Sugriva sent brave monkeys to collect water from the four oceans for the ceremony.  Hanuman, the fastest, got water from the icy north!

The priests got ready.  They crowned Rama and Sita.  Gods and goddesses showered them with blessings.  Rama looked magnificent in his royal clothes.  Gods gave him amazing gifts!

Everyone celebrated!  Rama gave lots of presents to everyone.  He gave Sita a beautiful necklace. Sita then gave her necklace to Hanuman!

The monkeys went back to their home. Vibhishana went back to Lanka.  Rama ruled Ayodhya, and everyone was happy.

Rama asked Lakshmana to help him rule. Lakshmana wouldn't, so Rama chose Bharata to help him. Rama ruled wisely and fairly for many, many years. Everyone was happy and healthy.  People lived long lives, there was plenty of food, and there was peace throughout the land.

The Ramayana story is a great story! Listening to it brings good luck.  It tells us how a good king should rule.  It reminds us of Rama's kindness, strength, and goodness.
