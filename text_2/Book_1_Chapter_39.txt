Rama was talking to a very wise man named Vishvamitra.  Vishvamitra was as bright as a fire! Rama asked, "Wise man, can you tell me about my great-great-great... grandfather, King Sagara? I want to hear about his special ceremony."

Vishvamitra smiled. "Of course, Rama!  King Sagara had a big ceremony between the Himalaya and Vindhya mountains.  It was the perfect place."

"During the ceremony," Vishvamitra continued, "a special horse was let loose.  Amshuman, a strong warrior, was supposed to protect it. But a sneaky demon stole the horse!"

The priests shouted, "Someone stole the horse! King Sagara, help!"

King Sagara had sixty thousand sons! He told them, "A bad demon stole the horse! Find it! Search everywhere! Dig if you must! I can't leave this ceremony."

His sons were happy to help. They searched everywhere! They couldn't find the horse, so they started digging with their strong, sharp fingernails! They used shovels and plows too.  The ground shook! They even fought scary snakes and monsters!

They dug and dug, so deep! They dug all the way to the other side of the world!  Even the gods and other magical beings were worried!  They went to Brahma, the great god, and said, "The king's sons are digging up everything! They're hurting everyone! They think everyone is a thief!"
