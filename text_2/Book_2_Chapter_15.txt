One morning, lots of important people came to the palace.  There were priests, army leaders, and rich merchants. They were all there to celebrate Rama becoming king!

It was a special day.  The sun was shining, and it was the same time of day Rama was born. The priests brought shiny golden bowls filled with water from special places â€“ rivers, lakes, even the ocean! They also brought a beautiful throne and a fancy chariot with a tiger skin seat. There were flowers, honey, and yummy butter, too!  Pretty singers were there, and musicians played their instruments.  Everything was ready for Rama to become king.

But King Dasaratha wasn't there yet! Everyone wondered, "Who will tell the king we're here?"  Sumantra, the king's good friend, stepped forward. "I'll go get Prince Rama," he said.

Sumantra went to the king's room. He woke up the king and said, "Your Majesty, everyone's waiting!  It's time for Rama to become king!"

The king said, "Quickly, bring Rama to me!"

Sumantra went to Rama's palace.  Wow!  It was amazing!  It was bright white, like a snowy mountain. It sparkled with gold and jewels.  Peacocks and cranes lived there! People from faraway lands had come with gifts to see Rama. A big, strong elephant named Shatrunja was ready to carry Rama.  There were horses, chariots, musicians, and artists everywhere!

Sumantra finally found Rama. He was ready to become king!
