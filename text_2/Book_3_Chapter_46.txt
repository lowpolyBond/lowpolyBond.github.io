Once upon a time, Lakshmana, Rama's brother, was upset with Sita.  He left to find Rama.

While Lakshmana was gone, a sneaky demon named Ravana came to Sita's home. He pretended to be a holy man, with long hair and a special walking stick. It was getting dark, and Sita was all alone.  Ravana was very, very powerful. When he appeared, even the trees and river stopped moving!

Ravana looked at Sita. She was sad because Rama was away.  He pretended to be kind.

Ravana was very handsome. He told Sita she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. He said, "You are like a beautiful princess from a fairy tale! You're too pretty to live here in the forest with all the scary animals! Come with me to a beautiful palace!"  He said lots of nice things to make her feel good.

Sita didn't know he was a bad guy.  She thought he was a nice holy man. She offered him food and water.  She was so kind and polite.

Sita was waiting for Rama and Lakshmana to come back. She looked and looked, but they weren't there.  She was very lonely.  She didn't know that Ravana, the mean demon, was about to take her away.
