Rama and his monkey army had sailed across the ocean!  They'd built a HUGE bridge!  Ravana, the mean king of Lanka, was surprised.  He was very boastful.

He told his friends Shuka and Sarana, "Those monkeys crossed the ocean!  Find out how many there are, how strong they are, and what their plan is!"

Shuka and Sarana changed into monkeys.  They tried to sneak into the monkey army. But the monkey army was SO big and strong, it was impossible to count them all! They roared and climbed everywhere! It was like a giant ocean of monkeys!

Bibishana, a good monkey, saw Shuka and Sarana. He knew they were spies! He told Rama, "These are Ravana's spies!"

Rama wasn't angry. He said, "You were sent to spy on us? Okay, go back. Tell Ravana this:  Tomorrow, my arrows will destroy his city! My army is too strong!"

Rama let Shuka and Sarana go free! They were amazed by Rama's kindness.

Back in Lanka, they told Ravana, "Rama's army is unbelievably strong!  Rama, Lakshmana, Sugriva, and Bibishana are super-strong leaders!  They could destroy your city all by themselves! Make peace and give Sita back to Rama!"
