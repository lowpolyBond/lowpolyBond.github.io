A long, long time ago, a wise man named Vishvamitra was praying in the forest.  He needed a quiet place.  So, he moved to a new, beautiful forest far away. He ate fruits and roots.

Meanwhile, King Ambarisha was having a big ceremony.  It was a horse sacrifice!  But, sneaky Indra, the king of the gods, stole the horse! The priest told the king, “Your horse is gone!  You need a new horse, or… you need to give someone to be sacrificed instead!”

King Ambarisha was sad. He offered lots and lots of cows to anyone who could find a horse or a person for the sacrifice. He searched everywhere!  He looked in cities, forests, and even holy places.

Finally, he found a wise man named Richika, who lived on a mountain with his wife and sons.  The king asked Richika if he could give one of his sons for the sacrifice, in exchange for many cows.

Richika said, “No! I won't give away my oldest son.” His wife said, “And I won't give away my youngest son!”

Then, the middle son, Shunashepha, spoke up. He said, “My father loves his oldest son, and my mother loves me. So, take me, King!”

King Ambarisha was very happy. He gave Richika lots of cows, and took Shunashepha back to the ceremony.  And that, my friends, is how Shunashepha became part of the big ceremony!
