Ravana, the ten-headed king, was very angry!  Malyavan, a wise advisor, had told him to give Sita back to Rama.  Ravana scoffed. "That silly Rama? He's all alone in the forest!  He's not as strong as me! I'm the king of the demons! The gods are even scared of me!"

Ravana roared, "Why should I be afraid? I kidnapped Sita!  I'll defeat Rama and his monkey army!  Rama built a bridge across the ocean? Big deal!  He won't come back alive!"

Malyavan felt scared and quietly left. Ravana, with his helpers, planned how to defend his city, Lanka.

He gave each gate to a strong warrior.  Prahasta guarded the east.  Mahaparshva and Mahodara guarded the south.  His powerful son, Indrajit, guarded the west. Shuka and Sarana guarded the north.  Ravana said, "I'll guard everywhere too!"

He put Virupaksha, a brave warrior, in the middle of the city with lots of soldiers.  Ravana felt very sure Lanka was safe. He sent his helpers away and went to his beautiful palace. He thought he had won, but fate had other plans!
