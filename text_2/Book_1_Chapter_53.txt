Once upon a time, a magical cow named Shabala lived with a wise sage named Vasishtha.  This cow was amazing! She gave everyone whatever they needed.  She provided mountains of yummy rice, sweet treats, honey, milk, and delicious food of all kinds. King Vishvamitra and all his people came to visit Vasishtha, and Shabala made sure everyone had a huge feast!

After the wonderful meal, the king loved Shabala so much, he wanted her!  He offered Vasishtha a hundred thousand cows in exchange.  "Please, holy sage," he said, "give me Shabala! She's a treasure, and treasures belong to kings!"

But Vasishtha said, "No, King!  I wouldn't trade Shabala for ten million cows, or even mountains of gold! Shabala helps me feed the gods and do my sacred rituals. She's very important to me."

The king really wanted Shabala. He offered even more: fourteen thousand elephants with golden decorations, one hundred and eight chariots made of gold, eleven thousand horses, and ten million more cows!  He begged, "Please, give me Shabala!  Take all my gifts!"

But Vasishtha still said no. "Shabala is more precious than all your riches," he explained gently. "She's my life, my everything. I can't give her up."  The king had to leave without Shabala, understanding that some things are more valuable than gold and jewels.
