Ravana, a super strong king, marched his huge army to the gods' city.  His army was so big, it was like a giant wave crashing everywhere!

Indra, the king of the gods, was scared. He told all the other gods, "We must fight Ravana!"  The gods got ready for a big battle.

Indra was still worried. He went to Vishnu, a powerful god, and said, "Vishnu, Ravana is too strong!  He has magic powers!  Can you help us?"

Vishnu said, "Ravana's magic makes him almost unbeatable. I can't fight him directly. But don't worry! I promise I will make sure Ravana dies."

The gods and Ravana's army clashed!  It was a huge, noisy battle with lots of flying weapons.  Ravana's army had many strong fighters, like Marica, Prahasta, and many others. They were all very brave.

Ravana's army was winning. The gods were getting pushed back.  Then Savitra, a brave god, fought Ravana’s grandfather, Sumali.  It was a really amazing fight!

Savitra was very strong. He smashed Sumali's chariot with his magic weapons.  He hit Sumali so hard with his club that Sumali turned to dust!

When the other monsters saw Sumali was gone, they were scared and ran away.  The gods won the battle, but they knew the fight against Ravana wasn’t over yet.
