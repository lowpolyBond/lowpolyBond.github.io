A big monkey army camped on the beach.  Two strong monkey generals, Mainda and Dvivida, kept watch.  They made sure everyone was safe.

Rama, the brave prince, looked at his brother Lakshmana.  He was very sad.  "I miss Sita so much," he said. "Every day feels longer without her."

Rama wasn't just sad because he missed Sita. He worried about her.  "She's all alone," he said.  "She's young and far away. I can hear her crying for help!"  He felt like his heart was burning.  It hurt so much!

Rama wished he could feel the wind touch him after touching Sita.  That would make him feel better, like a cool drink on a hot day.  He wanted to be near Sita, even if it was just on the same earth.

"Lakshmana," Rama said, "I'm going for a swim in the ocean.  I hope being near the water will help me feel less sad."  He knew Sita was still alive, and that gave him hope.  He pictured her beautiful eyes, like lotus flowers. He longed to hold her again and feel her near.

Rama felt like Sita, all alone with the mean demons, was like a lost child.  He promised he would defeat the demons.  Then Sita would be happy again, like the moon shining after the clouds go away.  She was thin from worry and not eating.

"Oh, when will I defeat the demons?" Rama cried. "When will I hold Sita again, and see her happy smile?"  He wanted to throw away his sadness like a dirty shirt.

The sun went down.  Lakshmana tried to comfort Rama, but Rama still missed Sita.  Even though he was sad, he still prayed. He couldn't stop thinking about Sita's beautiful eyes.
