King Dasharatha died.  Bharata was very, very sad.  A wise man named Vasishtha told Bharata, "It's time to say goodbye to your father."

Bharata was lying on the ground, so sad.  He got up and helped with the funeral.  The king's body looked like he was sleeping, even though he'd been in oil for a long time.

Bharata cried. He said, "Father, why did you send Rama away? Now Rama is gone, and you are gone! Our kingdom feels empty and sad without you. It's like a dark night without a moon."

Vasishtha said again, "Bharata, don't be sad. We need to finish the funeral."

The priests started the ceremony. They carried the king's body on a special bed.  People threw flowers and coins as they walked.  They burned sweet-smelling wood and incense.

They took the king to the Sarayu River. They made a big fire using special wood. They put the king on the fire.  The priests chanted prayers.  They wanted the king to go to a happy place.

The king's wives came. They were so sad! They cried and cried. Their crying was as loud as birds singing sadly.  They poured water on the fire and then went back to the palace.  For ten days, they slept on the hard ground, still very sad.
