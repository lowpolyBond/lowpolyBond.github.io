Rama, a very good and kind prince, had to go live in a scary forest.  His wife, Sita, wanted to go with him.  But Rama said, "No, my dear Sita."

He explained, "The forest is a dangerous place.  It's called 'Antara,' which means 'not good for people to live in.'  There are scary lions and wild elephants!  It's hard to cross the rivers, and there are even crocodiles! The paths are thorny, and there's not much food. You'll have to sleep on the ground, not in a comfy bed."

Rama continued, "You'll be hungry and tired. You'll have to find your own food, like berries and fruits.  You'll need to pray every day and be very careful.  There are also lots of creepy crawlies â€“ snakes, scorpions, mosquitoes!  It's too hard for you, my sweet Sita. Please stay here, safe and sound."

Sita was very sad. She really wanted to go with Rama.  She didn't want to leave him.  But Rama kept saying it was too dangerous. He loved Sita very much and didn't want her to suffer.
