Once upon a time, Sita, Rama's wife, was worried.  She said, "Rama, why are we living in this forest?"

Rama, a very strong and kind prince, smiled at Sita. He said, "Sweet Sita, I promised to help some holy men.  They live in this forest.  Mean giants are hurting them."

The holy men, who were very good and peaceful, needed help.  These giants were scary! They were eating the holy men!  The holy men were too kind to fight back. They asked Rama for help, and Rama, being a good prince, always keeps his promises. He said, "Don't worry! I'll protect you!"

The holy men explained, "We spend all our time praying and being good. We don't want to fight. We're too peaceful to hurt anyone."

Rama told Sita, "I promised to keep them safe.  I can't break my promise, even if it means I have to stay here.  I have to protect them from those mean giants."

Sita loved Rama very much.  She understood. She said, "You're such a good person, Rama. I'm proud of you."

Rama loved Sita too. He said, "Your words are wise and kind, Sita. You make me stronger." Then, Rama, his brother Lakshmana, and Sita continued their journey through the forest, ready to protect the holy men.
