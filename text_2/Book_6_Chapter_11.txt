King Ravana was a bad king. He only cared about himself.  He was in love with Sita, and he didn't care that it was wrong. Because of his bad actions, bad things started to happen to him.

Ravana wanted Sita so badly. Even though there wasn't a reason to fight, he decided to go to war. He climbed into his shiny, golden chariot pulled by strong horses.  It was so beautiful, it looked like thunder rumbling!

Lots of strong warriors marched with Ravana. They carried swords and shields. Some wore fancy clothes with sparkling jewels.  They rode in chariots, on elephants, and on horses. It was a noisy, exciting parade!  The sound of trumpets and drums filled the air.

Ravana's chariot was even more amazing!  A beautiful canopy shaded him like a giant umbrella.  People waved giant fans made of yak hair. When he arrived, all the other titans bowed down to him.

Ravana went into a huge, fancy meeting hall.  It was made of gold, and guarded by spooky spirits! He sat on a giant throne made of emeralds. It was super comfy with soft cushions.

Then Ravana shouted, "Gather all the titans! The enemy is attacking!"

His messengers raced all over Lanka. They ran, rode horses and elephants, and zoomed in chariots.  The city was full of people and animals rushing around!

Soon, everyone was in the meeting hall.  They bowed to Ravana.  Some sat on chairs, some on cushions, and some even on the floor!

Even Ravana's brother, Vibhishana, came. He bowed down, too.  So did Shuka and Prahasta.  Ravana gave them special seats.

All the titans wore shiny gold and beautiful clothes. They smelled amazing from their flower garlands.  Everyone was quiet and listened to Ravana. He was strong and powerful, like a god among his people.
