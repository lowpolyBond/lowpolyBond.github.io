After Rama defeated Ravana, a powerful god named Shiva appeared.  Shiva praised Rama, saying, "Rama, you're amazing! You saved the world from the scary Ravana! Now go home to your family – your mother Kaushalya, and your other mothers, Kaikeyi and Sumitra, and your brother Bharata.  Rule Ayodhya well and make everyone happy!"

Shiva also said, "Rama, look! Your father, King Dasaratha, is up there in his magical chariot! He's gone to heaven."

Rama and his brother Lakshmana looked up.  They saw their father shining brightly in the sky.  King Dasaratha was so happy to see them! He hugged Rama tightly.  "My dear son," he said, "being in heaven isn't as good as being with you!  I'm so sorry about what happened –  I never should have listened to Kaikeyi. Seeing you safe and happy makes me so happy."

King Dasaratha told Rama, "You did everything the gods wanted you to do! You fought Ravana, and now it's time to go home and rule Ayodhya. Your mother Kaushalya will be overjoyed to see you!  Bharata will be so happy too!"

King Dasaratha then blessed Lakshmana.  "Lakshmana, you were a great help to Rama.  Because of your loyalty, you'll also go to heaven!"

He then spoke to Sita kindly. "Sita, don't be sad. Rama did what he did to show how pure you are. You are a wonderful woman."

After saying goodbye to Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita, King Dasaratha rode away in his chariot to join the gods in heaven.  He was very proud of his sons.
