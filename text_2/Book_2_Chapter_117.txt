Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana were sad.  They had to leave their home.  Bharata's army had messed up the place where they were staying.  It was dirty and smelly.

So, they decided to move. They walked until they reached a wise old man's home, Sage Atri.  Sage Atri was very kind. He welcomed Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana.

Sage Atri had a wonderful wife, Anasuya. She was very old and wise.  Atri asked Anasuya to be kind to Sita.  He told Rama, “Anasuya is amazing! She once helped everyone during a terrible drought. She even made ten long nights feel like only one!”

Rama agreed to let Sita stay with Anasuya for a while. Sita went to Anasuya.  Anasuya was old and her body was weak, but she was very happy to see Sita.

Anasuya said kind words to Sita. “Sita, you are so lucky! You followed your husband to the forest. That’s wonderful! A good wife always loves her husband, whether he’s rich or poor, good or bad.  You are a truly good woman, Sita.”

Anasuya told Sita that being a good wife is the best thing a woman can do.  She praised Sita for being so kind and loving to Rama.  Sita was very happy to hear such nice words from the wise old woman.
