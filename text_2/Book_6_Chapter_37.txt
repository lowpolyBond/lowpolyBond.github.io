Once upon a time, a big group of heroes – Hanuman, Jambavan the bear king, Vibhishana (Ravana's brother!), Angada, and many other brave monkeys – reached the island of Lanka.  Lanka was Ravana's kingdom, a super strong fortress!

They all talked about how to get in.  Vibhishana, Ravana's good brother, said, "I know how Lanka is guarded! My spies, Anala, Panasa, Sampati, and Pramati, saw everything.  They flew in as birds!"

Vibhishana explained:  "Prahasta guards the east gate. Mahaparshva and Mahodara guard the south.  Indrajit, Ravana's son, with LOTS of soldiers and weapons, guards the west! Ravana himself guards the north, with even more soldiers. Virupaksha guards the center."

"Ravana has ten thousand elephants, twenty thousand horses, and over a million foot soldiers!" Vibhishana told Rama.  "But don't be scared, Rama! You're super brave!"

Rama made a plan.  He said, "Nila will fight Prahasta at the east gate. Angada will fight Mahaparshva and Mahodara at the south. Hanuman, with his army, will go in the middle. Lakshmana and I will attack Ravana at the north gate, with Vibhishana and his friends."

Rama said, "We'll mostly fight as monkeys. It'll be easier to know who's on our side. Only seven of us will fight as humans."

Rama and his army were ready! They marched towards Lanka, happy and ready to fight. They were ready to defeat the wicked Ravana and rescue Sita!
