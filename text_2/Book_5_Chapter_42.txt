A huge monkey, Hanuman, was in Lanka.  He'd wrecked Ravana's beautiful garden!  Birds screamed, trees crashed â€“ everyone was scared.  Ravana's wives saw Hanuman.  He was HUGE!  Like a mountain!

They asked Sita, "Who is this giant monkey?"

Sita was scared. She didn't know.  She said, "Maybe he's a shapeshifter!"  The wives ran to tell Ravana.

They said, "King Ravana, a giant monkey wrecked the garden! He talked to Sita!  He might be a spy!"

Ravana was furious!  His eyes were red with anger. He sent his strongest soldiers to catch Hanuman.

Eighty thousand soldiers came! They had big teeth and scary weapons.  They rushed at Hanuman, but Hanuman was even stronger!

He roared!  His tail swung!  He was so big, he made the birds fall from the sky. He shouted, "I'm Hanuman! I'm Rama's helper!  I'll destroy Lanka!"

The soldiers were terrified!  Hanuman fought bravely. He grabbed a huge iron bar and smashed the soldiers. He was super strong and fast, like the wind!

Many soldiers died.  The few who escaped ran back to Ravana.  Ravana was even angrier!  He sent another strong warrior to fight Hanuman.  But that's another story...
