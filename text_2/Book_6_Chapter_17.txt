Bibishana, Ravana's brother, bravely left Ravana after a big argument.  He quickly found Rama and Lakshmana.

The monkey leaders saw Bibishana. He looked amazing!  He was tall and strong, like a shining mountain, and he had four strong friends with him.  They all wore shiny jewels and carried big weapons.

Sugriva, the monkey king, worried. He thought Bibishana and his friends were there to fight!  The other monkeys were ready to attack!  They grabbed big trees and rocks.

But Bibishana stopped them.  He explained, “I’m Bibishana, Ravana’s brother. Ravana is very bad. He stole Sita! I tried to make him give her back to Rama, but he wouldn’t listen. So I left him and came to ask for Rama's help.”

Sugriva was still suspicious. He ran to Rama and Lakshmana. He said, “This Bibishana might be tricking us! He could be a spy!”

Rama listened carefully.  He wanted to be sure.  He talked to his wise monkey friends, Hanuman and the others.  They all had different ideas.

Some monkeys wanted to attack Bibishana right away.  Others thought they should send a secret spy to check if Bibishana was telling the truth.  Jambavan, a very old and wise monkey, warned them to be careful.

Hanuman, the strongest monkey, said, "Let's talk to Bibishana more.  It takes time to really know someone.  His words sound honest, and he seems brave. Maybe he really wants to help us."

Rama listened to everyone. He was wise and kind.  He decided to talk to Bibishana and learn more about him before making a decision.
