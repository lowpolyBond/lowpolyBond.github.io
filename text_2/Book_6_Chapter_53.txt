King Ravana was furious!  His friend, Dhumraksha, had died. He roared like a giant angry snake.  "Vajradamshtra!" he yelled. "Lead our army! Defeat Rama and his monkey friends!"

Vajradamshtra, a powerful warrior, agreed. He quickly gathered a HUGE army.  There were elephants, horses, donkeys, and mules!  They were all decorated with bright flags. Vajradamshtra, wearing shiny jewelry, climbed into his golden chariot.

His army marched out – soldiers with swords, spears, and bows. They rode on elephants that looked like giant moving hills!  It was a spectacular sight!

But as they left, bad things happened.  Meteors fell from the sky. Jackals howled and spat fire! It was a scary sign.

Despite the bad omens, Vajradamshtra and his army attacked Rama's monkey army. The monkeys yelled loudly!  A big battle began!

The battle was wild! Monkeys and giants fought with swords and clubs. They even used trees as weapons!  Some giants and monkeys fell, hurt and bleeding.  The noise was terrible – crashing chariots, shouting soldiers, and ringing weapons!

Then, the giants and monkeys started wrestling! They punched, kicked, and even pushed each other with trees!  Many were hurt badly.

Vajradamshtra was strong and scary. But then Angada, a super strong monkey, joined the fight! He was so angry, his eyes were red. He swung a huge tree like a giant club, smashing giants left and right!

The battle was a mess!  The ground was covered in broken chariots, dead monkeys and giants, and lots and lots of blood.  Beautiful jewels and clothes were scattered everywhere.

Angada was unstoppable! He scattered the giant army like the wind blows away clouds!  The giant army was defeated!
