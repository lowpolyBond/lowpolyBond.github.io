Jambavan, a wise old monkey, saw Hanuman looking sad.  He said, "Hanuman, strong and brave like Rama and Lakshmana, why are you so quiet?  You're as strong as Garuda, the giant bird who carries huge snakes!  You're super strong and smart!"

Jambavan told Hanuman a story about his mother, Anjana.  She was a beautiful fairy who lived on a mountain.  The wind god, Vayu, loved her.  Vayu told Anjana, "I will give you a super strong and fast son!"  And he did!  That son was Hanuman.

When Hanuman was a baby, he thought the sun was a fruit! He jumped up to grab it and flew super high!  The god Indra got mad and threw a lightning bolt!  Hanuman fell and hurt his jaw.  Vayu got so angry that he stopped the wind!  The gods begged him to stop, and as a reward, they made Hanuman almost impossible to hurt.

Jambavan said, "Hanuman, we need your help! We're sad and lost.  Youâ€™re the strongest of us all! You can fly far, just like you flew to the sun!  Cross the ocean!  All the monkeys will cheer for you!"

Hanuman, feeling brave and ready, got ready to jump.  The other monkeys cheered!  He was about to cross the huge ocean.
