Queen Kaushalya was very sad.  Her son, Rama, had left the palace. He went to live in the forest.  

Queen Sumitra, another queen, saw Kaushalya crying.  "Don't be so sad," she said. "Rama is a very good man. He went to the forest to please his father. He's following the right path."

"But he's my son!" Kaushalya cried. "He's going to live in a forest!"

"Rama is brave," Sumitra said. "He’s strong and kind.  His beautiful wife, Sita, and his brother Lakshmana are with him. They will be safe.  The sun will be gentle on him, and the moon will keep him cool at night.  Even the forest will be kind to him."

Sumitra reminded Kaushalya that Rama was a hero. He had magic weapons.  He could protect himself.  His journey to the forest was only for a little while.  Soon, he would return home, a king again.

"Rama is the best," Sumitra said. "He's like the sun—bright and strong. Wherever he is, he's safe.  He will come back to you.  You will see him again. He will bow down to you and you'll hug him."

Queen Kaushalya listened to Sumitra's kind words.  She felt better. Her sadness went away, like rain clouds disappearing on a sunny day.  She knew her son, the great Rama, would be alright.
