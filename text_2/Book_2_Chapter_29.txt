Rama told Sita they would live in the forest. Sita was sad, but she said, "Rama, I love you!  Living in the forest with you will be happy. Even scary animals will be afraid of you!  My family told me to always be with you. I can't live without you! With you, even the strongest gods can't hurt me. You taught me a wife should always be with her husband. A wise person told my family I'd live in the forest. I've been waiting for this!  I want to go with you, Rama! Please let me! It will make me happy. It will show how much I love you.  A nice woman also told my mom I would live in the forest.  I asked you to play in the woods before, and now it's time! Please, Rama!  I want to be with you and help you.  Being with you will wash away all my bad things. You are my only god. If I die without you, I won't be happy in the next life.  I want to share everything with you. Please take me! If you won't, I will hurt myself!"

Sita begged Rama, but he still said no.  Sita was very, very sad.  Tears fell from her eyes. Rama saw how upset she was, but he still tried to change her mind.
