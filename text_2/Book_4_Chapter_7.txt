Rama was very sad. He missed his wife, Sita.  His friend Sugriva, a monkey, saw how upset Rama was.  Sugriva put his hands together and said, "I don't know where Sita is or how strong Ravana is, the mean monster who took her. But don't give up, Rama! I'll help you!"

Sugriva said, "I miss my wife too, but I don't give up. I'm just a monkey, but even I don't complain! You're a brave hero, Rama. Don't be sad."  He told Rama that brave people don't let sadness win. They use their brains and stay strong even when things are hard.

Sugriva said, "Don't let sadness take over, Rama!  People who are sad can't do anything.  Be brave again!"

Rama felt much better after Sugriva's kind words. He wiped his tears and hugged Sugriva. "You're a true friend, Sugriva," Rama said. "You helped me feel strong again. Finding Sita and Ravana won't be easy, but with you, I know we can do it! I'll keep my promise to find Sita and defeat Ravana."

Sugriva felt happy. He knew he could help Rama find Sita and defeat the bad Ravana.  He was ready to begin his search.
