One morning, Prince Rama and his brother Lakshmana got ready for the day.  They went to the river with their wise teacher, Vishvamitra.

Friendly people helped them get on a boat. "Hurry, wise one!" they said to Vishvamitra. "The sun is getting hot!"

As they sailed, Rama and Lakshmana heard a loud noise. "What's that?" they asked Vishvamitra.

"That's the sound of two rivers joining," Vishvamitra explained. "One river starts from a special lake called Manasarovar. It flows through Ayodhya and joins another river."  Rama and Lakshmana bowed to the rivers.

Soon, they reached the other side.  They saw a dark, scary forest. "Teacher," Rama said, "This forest is spooky! I hear scary animals!"

Vishvamitra said, "Long ago, there were two happy cities here. But a powerful demoness named Taraka lived nearby.  She's very strong, like a thousand elephants!  Her son, Marica, is even stronger. They scare everyone away."

"Taraka and Marica hurt many people," Vishvamitra continued. "They make this forest scary and empty.  Rama, you are brave.  Please defeat Taraka and free the land!"
