Rama and Sita lived on a beautiful mountain for a long time.  Rama showed Sita all the amazing sights.  They were both as beautiful as the king of the gods and his queen!

Rama said to Sita, "Look, my dear Sita! This mountain is so pretty, I don't even miss home anymore! See those tall, shiny peaks! They're all different colors – silver, red, yellow, even sparkly blue and green!  Lots of birds live here. Even though there are lions and leopards, they're peaceful because of the holy people who live here."

Rama pointed to many kinds of trees, naming them all: mango trees, jambu trees, and so many more!  He described pretty flowers and sweet fruits everywhere.  

"See those happy creatures, Sita?" Rama said.  "Those are kinneras, with their colorful clothes. And look at the vidyadharas' homes!  The waterfalls look like giant elephants splashing water!"

"The mountain air smells wonderful," Rama continued.  "If we stay here with Lakshmana for many years, I won't be sad at all.  This Cittrakuta mountain is filled with flowers, fruits, and singing birds.  It's the perfect place to live while I follow my father's wishes and make Bharata happy.  We can be good and peaceful here. It’s a good place to learn to be strong and kind.  This is even more beautiful than the king's palace!  We’ll be here for twelve years. We’ll stay strong, good and always protect our kingdom."

Sita looked around. The mountain was truly wonderful, full of colorful rocks and glowing plants at night. It had caves that looked like houses and gardens! She smiled at Rama.  She was very happy.
