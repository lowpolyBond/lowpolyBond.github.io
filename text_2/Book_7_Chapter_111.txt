Once upon a time, a very long time ago, a wise man named Valmiki wrote a wonderful story called the Ramayana.  It's a super-important story, even the gods love it!

The Ramayana is about a great prince named Rama.  It's a really long story, like a really, really long bedtime story!

This story is so amazing, it’s like magic!  If you listen to it, you'll be happy and healthy.  If you read even a little bit, it will make you a good person.  If you read a small part every day, you'll feel much better.

If someone tells you the Ramayana, you should give them a nice gift, like a pretty dress, some yummy food, or some shiny gold!  Making them happy makes the gods happy too!

If you read the Ramayana, especially at sunrise, midday, or sunset, you'll always be lucky. Your family will be happy, and you’ll live a long, long life.

After a very long time, the beautiful city of Ayodhya, which had been empty, became full of people again, thanks to the Ramayana!

The Ramayana is such a great story, it's loved by everyone, even the gods!  That's the end of the Ramayana.  The End!
