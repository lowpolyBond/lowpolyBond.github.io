King Dasaratha was giving away cows to the poor.  His nephew, Yudhajit, came to visit! Yudhajit was Bharata's uncle. He wanted to see Bharata. He heard Bharata was in Mithila with his father and brothers for their weddings.  So, he hurried there too!

King Dasaratha welcomed Yudhajit. They were happy to see each other.  Yudhajit stayed the night.

The next day was the wedding day!  King Dasaratha went to the special wedding place with wise people called sages.  Rama and his brothers were all dressed up.

A very wise sage named Vasishtha spoke to King Janaka, Sita’s father.  He said it was time for the wedding ceremony.

King Janaka said, "Let’s start!  My daughters are ready!"

King Dasaratha, his sons, and the sages went inside. King Janaka asked Vasishtha to perform the wedding.

The sages made the wedding place beautiful.  They lit a special fire. Sita was beautiful in her special clothes. Rama sat near the fire.

King Janaka said to Rama, "Rama, Sita will be your loving wife. Take her hand."  Everyone cheered! Flowers fell from the sky!  It was magical!

Then Lakshmana married Urmila. Bharata married Mandavi.  And Shatrughna married Shruta-kirtti.  All the brothers married their princesses!

More flowers rained down!  There was music and dancing! It was a wonderful wedding!

After the wedding, everyone went home happy. The princes went with their new wives. King Janaka went home too, very happy for his daughters.
