King Dasaratha, Rama's father, had died.  He had sent Rama and his brother Lakshmana to live in the forest for fourteen years.  Now, the king's helpers told Bharata, Rama's younger brother, "You should be king!  The kingdom needs a ruler."

Bharata was a good and honest prince.  He looked at all the shiny things ready for his coronation â€“ the special crown and robes.  But he said, "No!  Rama is my older brother. He should be king!"

Bharata explained, "Our family always has the oldest brother become king.  I can't take Rama's place." He made a big decision. "I will go to the forest. I'll live there for fourteen years for Rama. Then I will bring him back to be king!"

Bharata ordered his army to get ready. He wanted to take everything needed for Rama's coronation to the forest.  He said, "We will make Rama king, just like lighting a holy fire for a big celebration!  I won't let Queen Kaikeyi's wish to keep Rama away from the throne come true!"

He told his people to fix the roads to the forest so it would be easy to travel.  The people were so happy to hear this. They cheered, "Long live Prince Bharata! We want Rama to be our king!"  Everyone was overjoyed and cried happy tears. They all got to work, ready to help Bharata bring Rama back home to be king.
