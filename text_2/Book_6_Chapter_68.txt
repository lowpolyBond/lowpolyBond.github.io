Kumbhakarna, Ravana's giant brother, was fighting Rama.  Rama was very strong and brave. He fought bravely and defeated Kumbhakarna!

Some of Ravana's friends ran to tell him the bad news.  "King Ravana!" they cried, "Kumbhakarna is dead! Rama killed him!"

They described how Kumbhakarna lay dead, his body bleeding, part of him in the ocean.  He was huge and strong, but Rama was stronger!

Ravana was so sad that he fainted!

Then Ravana's other brothers heard the news.  They were very upset.  They all cried because they loved Kumbhakarna.

Ravana woke up, very sad. He cried and said, "My mighty brother!  Youâ€™re gone! You left me! How could Rama kill you? He's so strong!  You were so strong, even a thunderbolt couldn't hurt you! Now, the gods are happy, and Rama's friends, the monkeys, will attack Lanka, my city!"

Ravana felt hopeless.  He said, "What will I do with Sita now? I don't even want to be king anymore.  I can't defeat Rama.  I want to die too!"

Ravana also remembered Bibishana, his good brother, who had warned him. Bibishana had said Ravana would be in trouble. Now, Ravana knew Bibishana was right. Ravana was very, very sad. He missed Kumbhakarna, and he was scared. He fainted again, heartbroken over his brother's death.
