King Ravana was scared. Rama, the brave prince, had defeated him!  Ravana felt as small as a mouse next to a lion. He remembered Rama's powerful arrows, shining like lightning.  He was angry and upset.

Ravana sat on his big golden throne. He looked at his friends, the other giants. "I'm stronger than Indra, the king of the gods," he grumbled. "But I lost to a *man*! All my hard work was for nothing! I asked to be safe from gods and demons, but not from humans!"

Ravana remembered a scary prediction.  A wise person had said a man from the Ikshvaku family would defeat him.  He also remembered a curse from a woman named Vedavati.  "It's all true!" he cried. "The wise never lie!"

Ravana shouted, "Wake up Kumbhakarna! He's the strongest of us all. He can beat anyone!"

Ravana's friends rushed to find Kumbhakarna.  He was asleep!  He slept for days, even months!  He loved to sleep and eat.

They went to Kumbhakarna's giant cave.  It smelled of flowers.  Kumbhakarna’s breathing pushed them back!  He was HUGE, like a mountain! He snored so loud, it was scary!

They tried everything to wake him. They offered him tons of food – meat, deer, buffalo! They used perfume and flowers. They blew horns and banged drums.  They even shook him and hit him with big sticks! They even had elephants stomp on him!

Finally, after a long time, Kumbhakarna woke up! He was very hungry.  He ate mountains of food! Then, he asked, "Why did you wake me? Is Ravana in trouble?"

His friend Yupaksha told him, "It's not the gods. It's Rama and his monkey army! They're attacking Lanka!"

Kumbhakarna’s eyes grew wide. "I'll destroy them all!" he roared. "I'll drink Rama's blood!"

Kumbhakarna went to see Ravana.  He was so big, the ground shook when he walked!  People ran scared!  He was like a giant mountain, shining brightly.

Ravana was happy to see his powerful brother.  He was ready to fight!
