A clever monkey, after meeting Princess Sita, thought about his next task. He needed to find out how strong the enemy, Ravana, really was.

He knew he couldn't trick Ravana or give him gifts.  Ravana was too strong and proud! So, the monkey decided to be brave. He figured that if he fought Ravana's best warriors and won, the others would be scared.  A smart messenger doesn't waste time on small things; he gets the big job done!

The monkey had a plan. He decided to destroy Ravana's beautiful garden. It was filled with amazing trees and flowers, like a magical place!  He thought, "If I wreck this garden, Ravana will be very angry and send his army to fight me!"

Whoosh! The monkey went to work! He ripped up trees and vines with his strong legs.  He made a terrible mess!  The garden looked like a fire had swept through it.  Animals ran away, scared and confused.

When he was finished, the garden was completely ruined.  It was sad and broken.  The monkey, ready for a fight, stood proudly at the gate, waiting for Ravanaâ€™s army. He was ready to show how strong he was!
