Rama was very sad.  His wife Sita was kidnapped!  Sugriva, a helpful monkey king, saw Rama's sadness.  "Don't be so sad, Rama!" he said. "We know where your enemy is! We can rescue Sita!"

Sugriva explained his plan. "My monkey soldiers are strong and brave," he said. "They can even jump into fire! We'll build a bridge across the ocean to reach Lanka, where Ravana lives.  It will be a long bridge, but we can do it!"

"Lanka is on a big island," Sugriva continued. "Once we're there, we'll fight Ravana.  The monkeys are amazing fighters. They can even change shapes!"

Sugriva told Rama, "Don't give up! Be brave.  We'll win!  My monkeys will throw rocks and trees at Ravana's army.  We will get Sita back! We will defeat Ravana!"

Sugriva gave Rama a big hug. "Don't worry, Rama," he said. "With your strength and my monkey army, we'll win!"  Rama felt much better, and he knew, with Sugriva's help, he would get Sita back.
