Rama and his monkey army were fighting the demons of Lanka.  One day, a huge demon named Prahasta arrived with a giant army!

Rama asked his friend Bibishana, "Who is that big, strong demon with all those soldiers?"

Bibishana said, "That's Prahasta! He's a great warrior, leading a third of the demon army."

Prahasta roared and charged!  The monkey army shouted back.  A big battle began!

The monkeys fought with trees, rocks, and big stones. The demons fought with swords, spears, and axes.  It was a huge, messy fight! Lots of monkeys and demons were hurt.

Some of Prahasta's friends fought bravely too.  But the monkeys fought back hard!  Jambavan hit Mahanada with a huge rock!  Durmukha hit Samunnata with a tree!  It was a wild battle!

Prahasta got really angry. He shot lots of arrows at the monkeys from his chariot.  Many monkeys fell.  The ground was covered with bodies. It looked like a horrible, bloody river.

Then, a strong monkey general named Nila saw Prahasta. Nila charged! Prahasta shot many arrows at Nila, but Nila didn't give up.

Nila hit Prahasta's horses and broke his bow with a big tree!  Then they fought hand-to-hand, like two angry elephants.  Nila threw a giant rock at Prahasta's head!

The rock smashed Prahasta!  Prahasta fell down, dead.  His army ran away, scared and sad.

Nila was a hero!  Rama and Lakshmana were very happy and proud of him.
