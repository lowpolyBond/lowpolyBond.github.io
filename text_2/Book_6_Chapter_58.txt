Note from Griffith:

In Canto LVIII, the two armies meet. Dire is the conflict; ceaseless is
the rain of stones and arrows. At last Níla meets Prahasta and breaks his
bow. Prahasta leaps from his car, and the giant and the Vánar fight on
foot. Níla with a huge tree crushes his opponent who falls like a tree
when its roots are cut.
