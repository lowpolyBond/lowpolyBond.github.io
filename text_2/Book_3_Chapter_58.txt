Rama was very worried.  He saw Lakshmana coming back alone.  "Where is Sita?" he asked.  "Sita is my wife.  I can't live without her!  She came with me to the forest."

Rama was sad. He had been sent away from his kingdom. Sita was with him, and she was like a princess from heaven.  He loved her more than anything.  "Without Sita," he said, "I don't want to be king! I don't want anything!"

Lakshmana felt bad. He explained that he'd left Sita alone in the forest.  He'd heard a scary noise, and he thought it was Rama in trouble.  He rushed back to help.

Rama was afraid.  "Those mean demons killed Khara," he said. "Now they'll get revenge on Sita.  She's so kind and gentle. She's never been hurt before!"

Rama was so sad he almost cried. He ran back to their home in the forest. It was empty!  He looked everywhere Sita played.  He felt terrible.  He missed her so much.  His hair stood on end! He was very, very upset.
