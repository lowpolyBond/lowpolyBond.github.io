Shurpanakha, a mean demoness, came back hurt and angry.  Her brother, Khara, was furious.  "I gave you strong demons to help you!" he roared. "Why are you crying?  They're my best fighters! What happened?"

Shurpanakha sobbed.  "I tried to hurt Rama and Lakshmana," she whimpered. "I sent fourteen strong demons after them, but Rama killed them all! He's too strong!  He cut off my nose and ears!"

Shurpanakha was terrified. "Please help me!" she begged. "Rama is too powerful! He's like a scary fire!  Please kill him, my brother!  If you don't, I'll die of shame!"

Khara was surprised.  He thought he was strong, but he was scared of Rama too!  Shurpanakha kept crying and fainting. She was so upset about how strong Rama was.  She was really scared of him and his brother. She knew that even with all his army, Khara might not be able to beat Rama.
