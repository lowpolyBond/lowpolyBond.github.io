Once upon a time, a wise man named Valmiki wanted to hear about the best person in the world. He asked a traveling sage named Narada.  Narada knew all about everyone! He told Valmiki about Rama.

Rama was a prince! He was brave, strong, kind, and very handsome. He was great with a bow and arrow, and always did the right thing.  He was a good listener and helped everyone.  He was so good, he was like a god!

Rama's father, King Dasaratha, wanted Rama to be king someday.  But a mean queen, Kaikeyi, tricked the king into sending Rama away to live in the forest!

Rama's brother, Lakshmana, and Rama's wife, Sita, went with him.  They lived happily in the forest for a while.  Sadly, King Dasaratha died of a broken heart missing his son.

Rama’s other brother, Bharata, didn't want to be king without Rama. He went to the forest to ask Rama to come back, but Rama stayed true to his promise and remained in the forest.

While in the forest, Rama helped many people. He fought evil demons who were hurting others.  One powerful demon, Ravana, kidnapped Sita!

Rama was very sad. He searched everywhere for Sita.  He got help from a friendly monkey named Hanuman, and lots of other monkeys. Hanuman even flew across a huge ocean to find Sita!

Hanuman found Sita, gave her a ring from Rama, and then burned down Ravana’s city.  Then Rama, with the help of his monkey friends, fought and defeated the evil Ravana, and rescued Sita!

Rama and Sita returned home.  Rama became king. He ruled wisely and kindly. Everyone was happy and safe during his reign.  After many, many years, Rama returned to his heavenly home.

The story of Rama teaches us about being good, brave, and kind, just like Rama himself.  And that's the end of our story!
