Once upon a time, Tara, a queen known throughout the land, found her husband, the Monkey King, dead on the ground.  He was lying on the hard earth.  Tara was very sad.

She cried, "My love! You didn't listen to me! Now you lie here, cold and still. You're hugging the ground instead of me! You don't even talk to me!"

She was heartbroken.  Sugriva, another monkey, had become a hero.  Everyone praised Sugriva.  Tara cried, "My husband was so strong! Why didnâ€™t he wake up? He fought bravely, and now he sleeps on the very ground where his enemies once fell!"

Tara was so sad because she was now a widow.  She said, "A warrior's life is dangerous. I wish I had never married a king who fought in wars!"  She felt lost and alone.

She saw her husband's body covered in blood.  A brave monkey soldier, Nala, pulled out the arrow that had killed the king. More blood flowed from the wound.  Tara gently wiped the dirt and blood from his body, crying as she did.

She then turned to her son, Angada.  His eyes were red with sadness. "My son," she said, "look at your father. He's gone. He died because of a bad fight, a trick."

Angada hugged his father's feet. He cried, "Father, you used to tell me to live long. Why don't you talk to me now?"

Tara said, "My son, I'm like a cow next to a dead bull. My husband is gone.  I can't even find the special golden chain the gods gave him!  He didn't listen to me, and now we are all lost.  Good luck has left us."
