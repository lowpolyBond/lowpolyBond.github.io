Rama, the brave prince, was fighting Ravana, the ten-headed demon king!  Lakshmana watched. Rama shot many arrows at Ravana, but Ravana, in his chariot, fought back with lightning-fast darts!

The gods watched the battle.  They said, "It's not fair! Rama's fighting on foot, and Ravana's in a chariot!"

Indra, the king of the gods, sent his fast chariot and driver, Matali, to Rama.  Matali's chariot was beautiful, made of gold, with bells and bright green poles.  It was pulled by strong, white horses!

Matali said, "Indra gave you this chariot to win the fight!  Get in, and let's defeat Ravana!"

Rama climbed into the chariot. Now, it was chariot against chariot! Rama and Ravana fought with powerful arrows and magical weapons.  Ravana shot scary, fiery arrows that turned into snakes!

Rama had a magic arrow too! He shot it, and it turned into golden eagles that ate the snake arrows!  Ravana was angry.  He shot so many arrows that he even hurt Matali! He even broke the chariot's flag!

Then, the sky went crazy!  The sun looked strange, the ocean roared, and everything seemed scary.  Ravana was very strong! He was almost winning. Rama was getting angry too.  His eyes blazed.  He was ready to fight even harder!
