The sun peeked over the hills.  Rama, the king, called everyone together.  His sons, Kusha and Lava, were amazing singers!  Rama asked them to sing a special song about everything that happened.  They sang a beautiful song about the whole Ramayana story.

Sita, Rama's wife, had gone back to the earth.  Rama was very, very sad. He missed her so much!  He gave lots of treasure to all his friends â€“ the monkeys, bears, and even the powerful giants!  Then, he went home to Ayodhya.

Rama never forgot Sita. He always remembered her.  At every special ceremony, he put a golden statue of Sita beside him.  He did many good things for his people. He gave away lots and lots of gold!  He made sure everyone had food and homes.  

For a very, very long time, Rama was a wonderful king. Everyone loved him! The weather was always good, and everyone was happy and healthy.  No one got sick, and nobody went hungry.

After many, many years, Rama's mother got old and passed away.  Then his other mothers also passed away.  They all went to a happy place in the sky to be with Rama's father, Dasaratha.

Rama missed his mother and performed special ceremonies to remember her. He always gave gifts to the wise people.  He was a very good and kind king.

For thousands of years, Rama ruled wisely and fairly. He always did what was right.  He made his kingdom a wonderful place to live!
