King Trishanku wanted to go to heaven while still alive.  He asked his teacher, Vasishtha, for help. But Vasishtha's one hundred sons were angry!

"You're not a good student!" they shouted. "We won't help you!"

King Trishanku was sad. He said, "Okay, I'll ask someone else."

The angry sons cursed him!  Suddenly, King Trishanku changed! His skin turned dark. He was thin and his hair was shaved. He looked like a poor person, covered in ashes.  His fancy jewelry turned into dull lead.

The people of his city were scared. They ran away!  Trishanku was all alone and very sad.

He went to see a powerful sage named Vishvamitra.  Vishvamitra felt sorry for him.  "Why are you here?" he asked.

Trishanku explained everything. "My teacher and his sons refused to help me," he said. "They cursed me! Now I look terrible, and everyone hates me.  I've always been good, and I've done many good deeds, but I'm cursed.  Please, help me!"

Vishvamitra felt bad for the kind king. He promised to help.
