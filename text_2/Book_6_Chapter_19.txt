Rama was kind and brave.  Ravana's brother, Vibhishana, was smart and good. He didn't like Ravana's bad deeds.  Vibhishana flew down from the sky and bowed to Rama.

"I'm Ravana's brother," he said. "Ravana is mean, so I'm asking you for help! I'm leaving my home and everything to be with you."

Rama smiled. "Tell me about Ravana's strengths and weaknesses," he asked.

Vibhishana explained. "Ravana is very strong.  A magic wish made him almost impossible to hurt.  He has a giant brother named Kumbhakarna, and a strong warrior named Prahasta who defeated Manibhadra!  His son, Indrajit, can disappear and fight very well.  He also has many, many other strong soldiers."

Rama listened carefully.  "I know all about Ravana," he said. "I will defeat him, his son, and his army.  Then I will make you king!"

Vibhishana was happy. "I will help you fight!" he promised.

Rama made Vibhishana the new king.  Then Hanuman and Sugriva asked, "How will we cross the ocean to reach Lanka?"

Vibhishana said, "Ask the ocean god, Sagara, for help."

Sugriva and Lakshmana told Rama. Rama liked the idea.  He said, "Let's ask Sagara for help to cross the ocean and reach Lanka."  Everyone agreed.  They were ready to fight Ravana!
