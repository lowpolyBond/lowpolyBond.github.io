Rama, a kind and loving prince, finished talking.  Then Bharata, Rama's brother, spoke. He said, "Rama, no one is as good as you!  Nothing bothers you, good or bad. Everyone respects you, yet you still ask for advice!

"Why should you be sad? You understand life and death, and you don't care about things you have or lose.  You know what's truly important.  Sadness doesn't touch people like you!"

Bharata continued, "Rama, please be kind.  My mother did wrong while you were away, and I feel so bad. I should punish her, but I can't. I know right from wrong. My father, King Dasaratha, was a good king, and I can't go against what he taught me. He made a mistake because he was afraid of my mother, Kaikeyi. He didn't think clearly.  But you don't have to be punished because of his mistake!  Don't blame yourself for what Dad did.

"Rama, please help our family. You're a strong warrior.  But being a king is also important. You should be king so you can protect everyone.  Why leave your duty to be a king for a sad, lonely life in the forest? The most important job is to be a king and take care of your people.

"I'm too young and not smart enough to be king! I need you, Rama!  Please, let the wise Vasishtha and the other leaders help you become king! Come back to Ayodhya with us! Be like Indra, the king of the gods, who rules happily. Let your friends celebrate, and let the bad people leave!  Help my mother and forgive her. Please, brother, have mercy!"

Bharata bowed down to Rama. But Rama stayed strong. He wouldn't change his mind. Everyone was amazed by Rama's strength, but they were also very sad.  The merchants, the wise teachers, and even the women cried, asking Rama to come home. They all praised Bharata for trying so hard.
