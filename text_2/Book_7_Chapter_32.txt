Once upon a time, a powerful king named Kartavirya Arjuna was having fun in the Narmada River with his many wives. He was so strong, he could stop the river with his many arms!  The river water went rushing back, carrying away flowers that King Ravana had been offering to the gods.

Ravana was angry!  He sent his spies, Shuka and Sarana, to see who caused the river to flood.  They flew and saw Arjuna playing in the water.  He looked huge, like a giant tree, with many wives around him.  His many arms were holding back the river!

Shuka and Sarana zoomed back to Ravana and told him what they saw. Ravana knew it was Arjuna, a famous warrior.  He stormed off to fight him! A dark, stormy wind blew as Ravana and his army arrived.

Ravana shouted at Arjuna's helpers, "Tell Arjuna that Ravana is here to fight!"

Arjuna's helpers laughed. "Fight a king who's relaxing with his wives? Wait until later!"  But Ravana's soldiers attacked!  A big battle began!

Arjuna's friends told him about the attack.  Arjuna, strong and brave, jumped out of the water! He fought with a huge club. One of Ravana's strongest soldiers, Prahasta, fought back, but Arjuna was too powerful. He knocked Prahasta down!

Ravana himself jumped in to fight Arjuna. They fought and fought!  It was a huge, noisy battle!  They swung their big clubs, like giant trees crashing together! Finally, Arjuna used all his strength and captured Ravana!

Everyone cheered!  But Ravana's other soldiers tried to free him.  Arjuna was amazing! He easily stopped them all. Then, Arjuna, carrying the captured Ravana, went back to his city as a hero. Everyone threw flowers to celebrate his victory!
