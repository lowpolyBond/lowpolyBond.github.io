A giant, kind creature named Kabandha helped Rama and Lakshmana.  He told them how to find Sita.  "Follow this path west," he said, "towards Mount Rishyamuka.  You'll find lots of yummy fruit on the trees!"

There were Jambu and Priyala and many other kinds of trees. Rama and Lakshmana could eat the sweet fruits to stay strong.

Kabandha said, "After the fruit trees, you'll find a beautiful forest, even nicer than a magical garden!  The trees are full of fruit and honey all year round. Lakshmana can climb the trees and get you the tastiest fruit – it's like magical food!"

Then they would reach Lake Pampa.  It was a lovely lake with soft sand and pretty flowers.  Lots of happy birds lived there – swans, ducks, and more!  They weren't afraid of people.  Rama and Lakshmana could even eat some of the birds.  There were also yummy fish with only one bone, easy to catch and cook! Lakshmana could get them fresh, clean water to drink, too.

In the evening, they'd see friendly monkeys near the lake.  The pretty flowers and the lake would make them feel better.

Kabandha said, "Near the lake is an old hermitage. An old woman named Shabari lives there. She's very kind and will help you.  Then you'll find the Mount Rishyamuka, it is home to Sugriva, a powerful monkey king who can help you find Sita."

Kabandha, who was now a shining, beautiful being, smiled. He flew away and said, "Go and meet Sugriva – he'll help you!"  Rama and Lakshmana thanked him and set off to find Sugriva and Sita.
