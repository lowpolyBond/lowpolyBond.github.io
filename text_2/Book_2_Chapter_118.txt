Once upon a time, a very wise woman named Anasuya talked to Sita, Rama's wife. Anasuya said that a wife should always respect her husband, even if he wasn't rich or smart.  Sita agreed. She said that a good husband is kind, strong, and always does the right thing, just like Rama.  Rama loved all his wives equally and treated them like his own mothers.

Sita remembered what her own mother and mother-in-law had taught her: a woman should always serve her husband.  She said that good women, like Savitri and Rohini, were rewarded in heaven for being good wives.  Anasuya was very happy to hear Sitaâ€™s wise words.

Anasuya was so pleased, she wanted to give Sita a gift.  She offered Sita beautiful clothes, jewelry, and special powder to make her even more beautiful.  Sita was very grateful.

Then Anasuya asked Sita to tell her about her wedding. Sita happily told her story.  Her father, King Janaka, found her in a field when he was plowing.  He was so happy to find her, he said she would be his daughter!  A voice from the sky even confirmed it!

When Sita grew up, King Janaka wanted to find her a good husband. He had a special, super heavy bow. Only the strongest and bravest prince could lift it.  Many princes tried, but they couldn't even move it!

Then, Rama came along with his friend, the wise Vishvamitra.  Rama easily lifted the bow and broke it!  King Janaka was so impressed, he wanted Rama to marry Sita.  But Rama waited for his father's permission first.  Then, Sita married Rama, and her sister Urmila married Lakshmana.  Sita said she was very happy to serve her husband, Rama.
