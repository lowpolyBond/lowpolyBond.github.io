Once upon a time, the mean king of the demons, Ravana, kidnapped Sita, a very kind princess.  He told Sita, "The nicer I am, the more you push me away. But I love you, so I won't hurt you... yet. You deserve to be punished for being mean to me!  I'll give you two months. After that, you will be my wife, or my cooks will chop you up for breakfast!"

Sita was scared, but some kind goddesses tried to comfort her.  Feeling brave, Sita shouted back at Ravana, "No one in your city wants you to do this awful thing!  How dare you touch Rama’s wife? Rama is super strong and brave! He's like a giant elephant, and you're a tiny hare! He will crush you! You're only brave because Rama isn't here! Your eyes are scary, and your mean words should make your tongue dry up! I could turn you to ash with my magic, but this is how you’ll be defeated! You tricked Rama to steal me!"

Ravana was very angry! He looked like a huge, scary mountain, all dark and powerful. He growled, "You’re stuck with me! I will destroy you tonight!"

Ravana then looked at his own scary demon friends. Some had only one eye, others had huge ears like cows, some had elephant feet! He told them, "Try to get Sita to like me!"

One demon lady named Dhanyamalini said, “Great King, why bother with this sad princess?  The gods have better things in store for you!  It's much better to be loved back!” She pulled Ravana away.

Ravana laughed and walked back to his giant palace, making the ground shake.  All the demon ladies followed him.  He left Sita all alone, scared but strong.  She still missed Rama very much.
