King Dasaratha was very sad. He missed his son, Rama, terribly.  He told Queen Kaushalya what happened a long time ago.

"My dear Kaushalya," he said, "I did a bad thing. I accidentally killed a young holy man. I felt so guilty! I went to his parents to say sorry.  They were very old and weak, like two birds without wings. They couldn't move. They were waiting for their son to bring them water."

The king's heart ached.  He was scared.  The holy man's father heard the king coming.

"My son," the father said, "Why are you so late?  Bring the water quickly! Your mother is worried."

King Dasaratha was so upset he could hardly speak.  Finally, he told the old man everything.

"I'm not your son," he said. "My name is Dasaratha, and I'm a king. I was hunting. I heard a sound, like an elephant. I shot an arrow. It hit your son! I thought he was an animal.  I'm so sorry."

The old man didn't curse him. He was very sad.  He said, "If you hadn't told me the truth, I would have cursed you, and your head would have exploded!"

The holy man's parents went to see their son's body.  They cried and cried.  The father said, "My son, who will help us now? Who will get our food?  Who will read to us?"

They were so heartbroken, they decided to die too. They made a fire and went into it.

The king said, "Kaushalya, that sad event is why I'm dying now.  The holy man's curse came true. I'm so sorry I sent Rama away. I miss him so much. I wish I could see him one last time."

The king was so sad he died right then. He missed Rama more than anything in the world.
