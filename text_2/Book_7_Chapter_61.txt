Once upon a time, some wise holy men went to a brave prince named Kakutstha.  They were very scared.  "Prince," they said, "help us!  A very bad guy named Lavana is hurting everyone!"

Kakutstha asked, "What can I do to help?"

One of the holy men explained, "Long ago, a good giant named Madhu was friends with the gods.  The god Rudra gave Madhu a super-powerful spear!  But Rudra said, 'Don't use this spear against good people or gods, or it will disappear!'"

"Madhu was very good, but his son, Lavana, was very bad," the holy man continued. "He got the spear. Now, he's using it to be mean to everyone.  He's super strong because of that magic spear!  Many kings tried to stop him, but they couldn't."

"We heard you defeated the evil king Ravana," the holy men said. "You are the only one who can help us! Please save us from Lavana!"

Kakutstha listened carefully. He knew Lavana was a terrible threat. He thought about how he could defeat this powerful giant and save the holy men.  This was a great challenge, but Kakutstha was a brave prince, and he was ready to try.
