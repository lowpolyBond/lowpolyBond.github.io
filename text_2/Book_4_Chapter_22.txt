Bali was very, very hurt. He was breathing weakly and sighing.  He saw his younger brother, Sugriva, and spoke softly.

"Sugriva," he said, "don't hurt me. I made a big mistake.  It seems we were never meant to be friends, even though we're brothers. Today, you'll be king of the monkeys. I'm going to die. I'm losing everything â€“ my life, my kingdom, even my good name. But I need to ask you something important.

Look at my son, Angada. He's sad and needs your help.  He's my son, and more precious to me than life itself. Please be a father to him, protect him, and always keep him safe."

"Angada, my son from Tara, is brave and strong. He'll be a great warrior, just like me. And listen to his mother Tara. She's very wise, and whatever she says, you should do.  Also, always listen to Rama.  He's important, and you must obey him."

Bali gave Sugriva a golden chain. "This will be yours when I'm gone," he said.

Sugriva felt very sad. He took the chain.  Bali then turned to Angada.

"My son," Bali whispered, "be good.  Always obey Sugriva, whether you're happy or sad. Be loyal to him, and don't be friends with his enemies.  Don't be too friendly with anyone, or too mean to anyone. Just be fair."

Then, Bali died.  The monkeys cried. They were very upset.

"Our great king is gone!" they wailed.  "Kishkindha is like a desert now! He fought Golaba, a powerful warrior, for fifteen years, and won! Now who will protect us?"

Tara, Bali's wife, was heartbroken.  She fell to the ground, crying and hugging Bali's body.
