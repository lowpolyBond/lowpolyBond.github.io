King Janaka said, "Let Rama see the special bow!"

Vishvamitra, a wise man, agreed.  King Janaka told his helpers, "Bring the bow! It's decorated with pretty flowers and smells like sandalwood."

Five hundred strong men brought the big bow on a cart. They gave it to the king.  King Janaka showed the bow to Vishvamitra, Rama, and Lakshmana. He said, "This bow is very, very old!  Even the gods couldn't bend it!  Let's see what Rama can do."

Vishvamitra said to Rama, "Look at this amazing bow, my boy."

Rama looked at the bow. He said, "I will try to lift it!"  The king and Vishvamitra said, "Okay!"

Rama easily picked up the bow!  It was so strong, it broke in two with a HUGE CRACK!  The ground shook! Everyone except Rama, Lakshmana, and Vishvamitra fell down!

After a little while, everyone woke up. King Janaka was very happy!  He said, "Rama is amazing! He can marry my daughter, Sita!"

King Janaka sent fast messengers to Rama's father, King Dasaratha.  The messengers told King Dasaratha, "Rama passed the test! He's marrying Sita!"  They invited King Dasaratha to the wedding.  Vishvamitra agreed, and the messengers zoomed off in their chariots.
