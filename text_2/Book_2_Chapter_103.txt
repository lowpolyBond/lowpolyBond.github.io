Once upon a time, Rama's mother, Queen Kaushalya, and the other queens went to visit Rama in the forest.  They were very sad because Rama, his brother Lakshmana, and his wife Sita had lost their kingdom.

As they walked, they saw Rama and Lakshmana near a river. Lakshmana was getting water for Rama. Queen Kaushalya cried. She felt so bad seeing her son doing such hard work. She said, "My poor Rama! He's so kind to his brother!"

Then, they saw Rama had made a simple offering of food for his father's memory.  Queen Kaushalya felt even sadder.  She thought the offering was too simple for such a great king.

When they finally reached Rama, they saw him looking sad and thin.  They cried even more.  Rama got up and touched their feet to show respect. Lakshmana and Sita did the same.  Queen Kaushalya hugged Sita and cried, "My dear Sita, you look so tired and thin!  I am so heartbroken to see you like this!"

Then, a wise man named Vasishtha came. Rama greeted him respectfully.  After that, Rama's younger brother, Bharata, arrived with many important people from the kingdom. Bharata sat respectfully near Rama.  Everyone wondered what Bharata would say to Rama. Rama, Lakshmana, and Bharata looked like three bright lights together.
