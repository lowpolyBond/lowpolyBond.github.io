Once upon a time, Queen Kaikeyi was very upset.  Her mean friend, Manthara, had made her angry. Kaikeyi acted like she was hurt and sad, rolling on the ground. She whispered a secret plan to Manthara, who smiled.  Manthara was happy to help Kaikeyi be mean.

Kaikeyi was so mad, she even threw her pretty jewelry on the floor! She looked very messy and sad.  She looked like a princess who had fallen from the sky!

King Dasaratha was very happy. He was going to make his son Rama a prince! He wanted to tell his wives the good news.  He went to see Kaikeyi first.  Her palace was beautiful, with pretty birds and flowers, and soft music playing.

But when the King got there, Kaikeyi wasn't there!  He asked a servant, and she whispered, "She's in the 'anger room'!"

The King was worried. He found Kaikeyi lying on the floor, looking very sad.  He loved her very much and felt terrible.  He asked, "What's wrong, my dear? Are you sick?  Tell me what I can do to help! I'll do anything for you! I'm the king, I have all the power in the land!"

He promised to give her anything she wanted, even half his kingdom!  Kaikeyi seemed a little calmer, but she was still planning something mean.  She was going to make the King do something very bad.
