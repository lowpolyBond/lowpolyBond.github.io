Ravana, the terrible giant, spoke mean words to Sita.  Sita was very sad.  She was scared, but she was brave. She didn't want to be with Ravana.

"Go away," Sita said softly. "I will never be your wife. I love Rama, and I am only his."  She put a piece of straw between them.

"I belong to a good family," Sita said. "I am a good wife.  You should be happy with your own wives." She turned her back.

Sita told Ravana he was a bad king.  "You are mean to others," she said. "Because of you, your kingdom will be destroyed!"

"Your riches can't buy me," Sita explained. "I'm like the sun's light – I belong to Rama. He is my husband.  He's strong and good. Let me go back to him!  If you do, your kingdom will be safe. If you don't, Rama will defeat you!"

Sita warned Ravana, "Rama is like a powerful eagle.  He’s going to come for me! He is very strong, like the god Vishnu. He will fight you!"

She told him he was a coward.  He took her while Rama and his brother were away hunting.  "You're afraid of Rama!" she cried. "He will defeat you easily!"

"Rama will find you, no matter where you hide," Sita promised. "He will be as fast as lightning!"  She knew Rama would come and rescue her.
