Rama was sad. Heâ€™d been fighting a scary monster that looked like a deer.  He found Lakshmana all alone!  "Lakshmana," Rama said softly, "Where's Sita?  My heart is worried. I saw you coming, and I felt scared."

Lakshmana was upset. "It wasn't my fault!" he explained.  "Sita heard someone shout, 'Lakshmana, help!'  She thought it was you, Rama! She was very scared and cried, 'Go, go, help Rama!'  I tried to tell her it wasn't you. I said, 'Rama is strong!  No monster can hurt him!' But Sita was worried and angry. She said I only came to see her and that I didn't want to help you!"

Lakshmana's voice was shaky. "She said I was lying and only wanted her after you were gone."

Rama sighed. "Lakshmana," he said gently, "I know I'm strong, but you shouldn't have left Sita.  That monster changed into a deer to trick me. Then it changed back into a monster and cried for help to trick you.  Now I've shot him with my arrow."

Rama was still worried about leaving Sita alone.  He was sad that Lakshmana had come without her, but he understood why.  It was all a big misunderstanding because of a sneaky, mean monster!
