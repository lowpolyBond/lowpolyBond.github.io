Once upon a time, Prince Rama gave his special bow and arrows to the water god.  He then greeted his wise teachers.  He saw his dad, King Dasaratha, looked worried.  Rama said, "Dad, everything's okay now. Can our army go home to Ayodhya?"

King Dasaratha hugged Rama so tight! He was so happy to have his son back.  He marched his army back to Ayodhya in a fancy chariot.  The city was decorated with flowers and water.  Everyone cheered!

The streets were beautiful.  People shouted, "Welcome home, King!"  The king, his family, and the princes and their new wives went to the palace. It was as white as snow!

Everyone gave the king hugs and flowers.  The queens welcomed the new princesses. Sita, Urmila, and the two other princesses went to live in the palace.  They wore pretty clothes and went to the temple to pray. Then, they went to live with their husbands.

Rama, his brothers, and their friends spent time with their dad, learning how to fight.  After a while, King Dasaratha told Prince Bharata, "Your uncle is still here.  Go visit your grandfather!"

Bharata and his brother Shatrughna said goodbye to their dad and Rama. They went on a trip.

Rama and his brother Lakshmana took care of their dad like he was a god. They helped everyone in the city. Rama also loved his mom and his teacher very much. Everyone loved Rama because he was kind and good. He was as good as the gods!

Rama and Sita were very happy together.  Sita was beautiful and kind. She knew what Rama was thinking before he even spoke! They were perfect for each other, like a beautiful princess and a brave prince.

And that's the end of the first part of Rama's story!
