Rama, a very brave prince, was very happy to see his kingdom, Ayodhya. He thought for a moment and then told Hanuman, a strong monkey:  "Hanuman, please go quickly to Ayodhya! Find out if everyone in the palace is happy.  On your way, visit my friend Guha. Tell him I'm safe and doing well. He'll be so happy! Guha can help you find Bharata, my brother.  Tell Bharata I'm coming back with Sita, Lakshmana, and many friends. Tell him about Sita being taken away by the bad king Ravana, and how I fought to get her back.  Tell him how we built a bridge across the ocean, how we defeated Ravana, and how I met my father again! Tell Bharata that I’m bringing Bibishana and many monkeys with me.  Watch Bharata's face when you tell him.  See if he's happy to let me become king again. If he wants to be king, we can share the kingdom!"

Hanuman, super-fast, flew to Ayodhya like a bird. He visited Guha, then sped on.  He traveled far, crossing many rivers and forests.  Finally, near Ayodhya, he saw Bharata. Bharata was very sad and thin because Rama was gone. He lived simply, wearing old clothes, and kept Rama’s sandals close. He ruled the kingdom very well, even though he missed his brother.

Hanuman bowed to Bharata and said, "Bharata, I have good news! Rama is returning! He defeated Ravana and rescued Sita.  He's coming back with Lakshmana!"

Bharata was so happy he fainted! When he woke up, he hugged Hanuman and cried tears of joy.  He said, "Thank you!  I want to give you a great gift – many cows, villages, and beautiful wives!"  Bharata was overjoyed to hear that his brother was coming home.
