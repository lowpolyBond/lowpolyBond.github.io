Sanjaya said, "King, imagine a huge, noisy crowd getting ready for a big fight!  Conch shells blew, drums banged, elephants trumpeted, and chariot wheels clattered. The ground shook!  The sky filled with the sound of horses neighing and people shouting.  Both the Pandavas' and Kauravas' armies were scared when they saw each other.

The elephants and chariots were decorated with gold, shining like beautiful clouds with lightning.  The flags of the Kaurava army were bright and colorful, like fire.  They looked like the amazing flags in the gods' homes! The warriors, dressed in shining golden armor, looked like the sun!

All the best Kaurava fighters stood at the front.  They were strong and brave, with big eyes and powerful bows and arrows.  Dussasana, Durvishaha, Durmukha, Dussaha, Vivinsati, Chitrasena, and Vikarna protected Bhishma from behind.  Many other brave warriors like Satyavrata, Purumitra, Jaya, Bhurisravas, and Sala were also there. Twenty thousand chariot fighters followed them!

Many other brave soldiers came from different places – the Abhishahas, Surasenas, Sivis, Vasatis, Swalyas, Matsyas, Amvashtas, Trigartas, Kekayas, Sauviras, Kitavas, and soldiers from the East, West, and North.  These twelve groups were ready to fight, no matter what. They all protected Bhishma.

The King of Magadha brought ten thousand elephants!  There were millions of soldiers protecting the chariots and elephants. Hundreds of thousands of foot soldiers marched in front, carrying swords, bows, and shields.  They even fought with their fingernails and special darts!

King, your son's army was HUGE – eleven Akshauhinis!  It looked like the Ganga and Yamuna rivers flowing together, but much, much bigger!"
