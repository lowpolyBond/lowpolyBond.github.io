His sharp arrows pierced Aswatthaman's armor.  Even though he was hurt, Aswatthaman kept fighting to help Bhishma. The Kuru army cheered! Aswatthaman was a brave warrior. He knew how to use all kinds of weapons.  Arjuna, who was kind, didn't want to hurt Aswatthaman because he was a priest's son. So, Arjuna fought other soldiers instead.
