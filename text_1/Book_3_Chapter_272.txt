Once upon a time, there was a very brave prince named Rama.  A wicked king of demons, Ravana, kidnapped Rama's beautiful wife, Sita.  Ravana was very strong and mean. He tricked a giant bird named Jatayu, and then took Sita away to his island home, Lanka.

Rama was very sad.  With the help of his monkey friend, Sugriva, and his army of monkeys and bears, Rama built a huge bridge across the ocean to Lanka! He fought Ravana and his army. Rama was so brave and strong that he defeated Ravana and rescued Sita. He used his magic arrows to defeat the demons and save Sita.

Yudhishthira wanted to know more about Rama.  So, Markandeya, a wise old man, told him the whole story.

Markandeya said Rama was the son of King Dasaratha.  Dasaratha had three other sons: Lakshmana, Bharata, and Satrughna.  Rama’s mother was Kausalya. Sita was the daughter of King Janaka.  She was very special and meant to be Rama’s wife.

Ravana was also very powerful. He was the grandson of a great god. His father was angry with him, so he created another son, who became a powerful demon.  Ravana’s grandfather gave him many gifts: a beautiful flying chariot, a magical island city called Lanka, and an army of demons to protect him.  But Ravana was a bad king, and this led to his conflict with Rama.  That's how Rama came to fight Ravana and save Sita!
