Once upon a time, during a great battle, Arjuna, a mighty warrior with white horses, chased away the Kaurava army.  But then, Karna, a strong warrior,  started to attack the Pancala soldiers.  He was like a storm, smashing clouds!

He knocked down Janamejaya's charioteer and then killed his horses.  He hit Satanika and Sutasoma with many arrows and broke their bows.  He shot six arrows at Dhrishtadyumna and killed his horses too!  He even killed Satyaki's horses and then Visoka, a prince.

This made Ugrakarman, a powerful warrior, very angry. He attacked Karna's son, Prasena, and made him shake with fear! But Karna quickly shot three arrows and chopped off Ugrakarman's arms and head.  Prasena then fought bravely, but was soon defeated by his enemy.

Karna was furious that his son was defeated. He shouted, "You're dead!" and shot a powerful arrow at Shikhandi.  But Shikhandi cleverly cut the arrow with his own arrows and then hit Karna! Karna fought back, breaking Shikhandi's bow and flag, and then he even killed Dhrishtadyumna's son!

Krishna, a wise leader, saw that many Pancala soldiers were dying.  He told Arjuna, "Arjuna, save them!"  Arjuna smiled, picked up his powerful bow Gandiva, and went to fight Karna.  His arrows flew like rain, blocking out the sun, and he defeated many soldiers and horses.  The birds even hid in the mountains from the noise!  Bhima, another strong warrior, followed to help.

Arjuna and Bhima fought Karna fiercely, but Karna kept fighting back, killing many more soldiers.  Five strong Pancala warriors attacked Karna, but he was too powerful! He easily broke their bows, horses, and flags and shot many arrows at them.

The five sons of Draupadi saw their uncles in trouble and rushed to help, like ships saving sailors from a storm.  Shikhandi hit Karna with many strong iron arrows, but Karna fought back with Kripa and Kritavarma.  Satyaki, a brave warrior, fought like a hero against these three mighty fighters.

Then, Duhshasana, another Kaurava warrior, attacked Bhima.  They fought like two angry elephants, hitting each other with powerful weapons! Bhima broke Duhshasana's bow and flag, and even killed his charioteer.  Duhshasana fought back, hitting Bhima with many arrows, but finally, Bhima defeated him, sending Duhshasana tumbling from his chariot.
