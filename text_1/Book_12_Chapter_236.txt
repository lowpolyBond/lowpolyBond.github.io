Once upon a time, a wise teacher named Vyasa told a story. He said, "Imagine life is like a river.  Sometimes the river is calm, sometimes it's wild!  Knowledge is like a raft. It helps you cross the river safely."

Vyasa explained that wise people, who understand life, are like skilled raft-makers. They can help others cross the river too. But people without knowledge are like lost boats, drifting aimlessly.

To get across, you need to be good. You need to let go of your wants and worries. Vyasa said that special people who did this followed a path with many steps, like a secret code.  They learned to control their minds and their words.

Vyasa then talked about a special journey. He said our body is like a amazing cart, and our soul is the driver.  Good deeds are like the cart’s strong wheels, and wisdom is like the map, guiding us.  Faith and self-control are our helpers running beside the cart, keeping us on the right path. The journey’s end is a special place, a wonderful place where we can be happy forever.

To start this journey, Vyasa said, focus on one thing at a time.  This is like practicing a skill, and the more you practice, the stronger you become.  This practice helps you become better at controlling things like wind and fire – even your own thoughts and feelings!

Vyasa continued, “As you get better, you’ll see amazing things inside yourself. First, you'll see a foggy mist. Then, clear water. Then bright fire.  Then, swift wind, as light as a feather! Finally, you'll reach a place of pure light and peace.”

He explained that if you control the earth, you could even create things.  Controlling wind lets you shake the whole world!  Controlling water means you can drink up oceans.  Controlling fire makes you shine brighter than anything! And when you master all of these things, you become all-powerful and wise.  It's like getting to the top of the highest mountain!

Vyasa talked about two types of souls: one that's always changing, and one that stays the same forever. The changing soul wants things like wealth and happiness. But the wise soul knows that true happiness is found in letting go of all these desires, and reaching a place of peace and understanding.

To reach this peace, Vyasa said to be kind to everyone.  Be honest. Don’t get angry easily. Be brave when things are hard.  Let go of your greed, be content with what you have, and treat everyone equally. If you do these things, you'll be on your way to this peaceful place.  This is how you cross the river of life.  This is how you reach the top of the mountain!
