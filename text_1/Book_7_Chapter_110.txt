Once upon a time, during a great battle, a brave warrior named Satyaki heard King Yudhishthira's worried words.  Yudhishthira was worried about his brother Arjuna.

Satyaki, a strong warrior like a mighty bull, said, "Don't worry, King! I've heard you. I'll do anything you ask, even give my life for Arjuna! I'll fight Suyodhana's whole army and win! I'll go to Arjuna, help him kill Jayadratha, and come right back."

But Satyaki had a problem. Arjuna asked him to protect Yudhishthira while he fought Jayadratha.  Arjuna was scared that the powerful warrior Drona would capture Yudhishthira.  Satyaki said, "Arjuna wants me to protect you, but I need to fight Jayadratha!  Drona is very strong, and only Arjuna or Pradyumna can really stop him. If I leave you, Drona might grab you!"

Yudhishthira said, "I understand, Satyaki.  But don't worry about me! Bhima, my other brothers, Draupadi's sons, many other brave warriors, and especially Dhrishtadyumna, will protect me. Dhrishtadyumna is super strong and will stop Drona. Go help Arjuna, my friend! Don't worry about me."

Satyaki, feeling much better, went to help Arjuna.  He knew Yudhishthira was safe with all those strong warriors protecting him.  And so, the battle continued!
