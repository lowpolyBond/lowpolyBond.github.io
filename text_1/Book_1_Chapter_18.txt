Once upon a time, there was a huge mountain called Mandara.  It was so tall and beautiful, with birds singing and animals roaming everywhere!  Even the gods and magical creatures visited it.

The gods wanted to use Mandara to churn the ocean, like mixing a giant milkshake, to get a magical drink called nectar.  But the mountain was too big to move! They asked Vishnu and Brahma, two powerful gods, for help.

Vishnu asked Ananta, a giant snake, to lift the mountain. Ananta was super strong! He lifted Mandara and carried it to the ocean. The gods asked the ocean and a giant turtle to help. The ocean said okay, and the turtle agreed to hold the mountain on its back.

The gods and the demons, called Asuras, worked together. They used the mountain like a giant stick and a huge snake named Vasuki as a rope to churn the ocean. The gods held Vasuki's tail and the Asuras held its head.  It was hard work!  Vasuki breathed fire and smoke, but Indra, the king of the gods, made rain to cool everyone down.

Churning the ocean was messy!  Lots of scary things came out â€“  big waves, and even fires!  But the gods kept churning.  First, they got the moon. Then, Lakshmi, the goddess of beauty, appeared.  Then came a magical horse and a beautiful jewel.

Finally, Dhanwantari, a god of medicine, appeared with a pot of the magical nectar! The Asuras wanted it badly.  Before that, terrible poison came out.  Lord Shiva, a very kind god, drank the poison to save everyone. Because of the poison, his throat turned blue, and he is now called Nilakantha.

The Asuras wanted to fight for the nectar, but Vishnu tricked them! He changed into a beautiful woman and the Asuras gave her the nectar because they were so charmed. The gods got the nectar and became immortal, living forever!
