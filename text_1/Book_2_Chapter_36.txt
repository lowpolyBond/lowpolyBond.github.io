King Dasaratha was very sad.  He had made a promise he couldn't keep. He told his friend Sumantra, "Get ready! We need to send Rama to the forest.  He'll need lots of things:  food, beautiful clothes, strong wagons,  soldiers, and people who know the forest paths.  Heâ€™ll need everything!"

Queen Kaikeyi was scared when she heard this.  She couldn't even speak!  Finally, she whispered, "Bharata won't want to rule a kingdom without all its people and riches!"

King Dasaratha was angry. "Kaikeyi," he said, "You asked for Rama to go into exile, but you didn't say he had to go with nothing!"

Kaikeyi got even angrier. "King Sagara sent his son Asumanjas away with nothing," she said.  "Rama should go the same way!"

King Dasaratha cried, "Oh, no!" Everyone felt ashamed, but Kaikeyi didn't care.

Then, a wise minister named Siddhartha spoke to Kaikeyi. "Asumanjas was a bad man," he explained. "He hurt children!  The people were scared of him, so King Sagara sent him away.  But Rama is good! He hasn't done anything wrong!  What reason do you have to send him away?"

King Dasaratha was heartbroken. He said to Kaikeyi, "Will you ignore what our wise minister said?  I'll go with Rama to the forest. You can rule with Bharata."
