Bharata was very sad that his brother Rama was sent to live in the forest.  He wanted Rama to come home.  He got on his chariot with his friends and advisors. They rode past a beautiful mountain, the Mandakini River, and even saw shiny metal in the ground!

Soon, they found a wise hermit, Bharadvaja. Bharata bowed to him. Bharadvaja asked, "Did you find Rama? Did you bring him back?"

Bharata said, "I and our teacher Vasishtha asked Rama to return. But Rama said he would stay in the forest for fourteen years, as his father had asked."

Then, Vasishtha, a very smart man, said to Rama, "Please give your special sandals to Bharata.  Think of your city, Ayodhya."

Rama listened to his teacher. He gave his sandals to Bharata.

Bharata said sadly, "I couldn't bring Rama back. I'm going home with just his sandals."

Bharadvaja smiled. He said, "Bharata, you are a good and kind prince. Your father, King Dasaratha, is lucky to have a son like you!"

Bharata bowed to Bharadvaja and went home.  His army marched with him â€“ some on elephants, some on horses, and some in carts. They crossed the Yamuna and Ganges rivers.

When they reached Ayodhya, Bharata was very, very sad.  The city looked empty and quiet. His father, the king, and his brother Rama were gone.  Bharata said to his driver, "Look how sad and empty our city is! It used to be so happy and full of life!"
