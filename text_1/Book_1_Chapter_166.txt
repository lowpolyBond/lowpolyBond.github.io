Once upon a time, there was a giant, scary monster named Vaka.  He was as big as a mountain and ate people!  A brave warrior named Bhima heard about Vaka.

Bhima found Vaka and, with one super strong move, he broke Vaka's leg!  Vaka screamed and died.  His friends, other scary monsters, were very scared.

Bhima told them, "Don't ever eat people again! If you do, you'll die like Vaka!"  The monsters promised they wouldn't.

Bhima dragged Vaka's body to the town gate.  The people of the town were amazed to see the giant monster dead. They were so happy!  They thanked the gods.

They wondered who had given Vaka his last meal.  A clever priest didn't want to tell anyone that Bhima, who was traveling in disguise, had killed Vaka, so he told a story. He said a magical priest had killed Vaka.

The people were so happy they had a big party! They celebrated the magical priest and thanked the gods for saving them. From that day on, the monsters were good and the town was safe!
