Once upon a time, in the land of the Mahabharata, a wise king asked Yudhishthira, a very clever prince, about the Sankhya philosophy.  It's like a special way of thinking about the world.

Yudhishthira said, "Oh, wise king, you've explained Yoga so well! Now, tell me about the Sankhya principles. You know everything in the whole wide world!"

The king, whose name was Bhishma, smiled and said, "Listen carefully!  The Sankhya system was started long ago by a great teacher named Kapila. It's all about understanding the truth.  It teaches us that everything has flaws, even the things we want most."

Bhishma explained that everything—people, animals, even magical beings like Rakshasas and Yakshas—is busy with things that will only last a short time. We are all born, we live, and we die. Knowing this helps us understand what's truly important: happiness.

He talked about different kinds of energies inside us: Sattwa (goodness), Rajas (passion), and Tamas (darkness).  These energies affect everything, even the way we think and feel. He said that understanding these energies helps us to find peace.

Bhishma used a simple example: "Our eyes see shapes, our nose smells scents, our ears hear sounds." He continued, explaining that everything is connected. The wind needs space, and space needs something else, and so on, all the way to a powerful, peaceful energy called Narayana, which is like a source of ultimate happiness.


Bhishma went on to explain that our bodies have five problems: desire, anger, fear, sleep, and breathing. But wise people can overcome these problems. For example, they can overcome anger with forgiveness, and desire by not wanting too much.

He described life like a big, scary ocean.  Sorrow is the water, diseases are the alligators, and fear is the snakes.  But wisdom is our raft, and knowledge is our island of safety.

Bhishma even used a cool metaphor:  "The Sankhya way is like the sun's rays, carrying good people to a beautiful place in the sky, where they find ultimate happiness. Then that place takes them to another beautiful place, and then to another, until finally, they reach Narayana."

Yudhishthira then asked a tricky question:  "When people reach this happy place, do they remember their past lives?"

Bhishma said that's a really hard question, even for smart people.  But he explained that even while we're sleeping, our soul is active, seeing and feeling things.  When we die, our soul goes back to the Supreme Being, like a little stream flowing back to the ocean.  We leave our body behind, and our soul unites with the ultimate source of all things, and becomes immortal.

Finally, Bhishma said that the Sankhya system is the best kind of knowledge. It's like a wise guide that helps us find our way to true peace and happiness, freeing us from the problems and worries of the world.  He said this knowledge has always existed and will always exist –it’s eternally true.
