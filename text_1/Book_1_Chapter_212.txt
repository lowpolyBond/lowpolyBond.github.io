Once upon a time, two giant brothers, Sunda and Upasunda, decided they wanted to rule the whole world!  They were strong Daityas (like giants).

They gathered their army.  Lots of other giants joined them. They marched at night, ready for battle!  Their bards sang happy songs, hoping for victory.  They flew up into the sky!

The gods were scared.  They ran away to hide.  Sunda and Upasunda were super strong.  They easily defeated all the other creatures in the sky, and then they went down to defeat the creatures who lived under the ground and in the ocean.

Then they went to Earth.  They said, "The wise people who do sacrifices help the gods, and the gods are our enemies! Kill them all!"

So, they went around killing everyone who was doing a sacrifice.  They even threw the sacred fire into the water!  The wise people tried to curse them, but it didn't work. The wise people ran away, scared.  Their homes were destroyed.

Sunda and Upasunda changed shapes – into scary elephants, lions, and tigers – to hunt down the wise people who were hiding. They sent them to the land of the dead.  

Nobody did any sacrifices or ceremonies anymore.  No one farmed or took care of their animals.  The towns were empty, full of bones.  Even the sun, moon, and stars were sad.

Finally, Sunda and Upasunda ruled Kurukshetra, and no one dared to challenge them.  The world was a very scary place!
