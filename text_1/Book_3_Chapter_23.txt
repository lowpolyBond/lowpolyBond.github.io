The Pandavas – Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, and the twins, Nakula and Sahadeva – were leaving their beautiful city. They looked strong and brave, like the god Shiva!  Krishna, their friend, and their priest went with them. They rode in fancy chariots pulled by strong horses.

Before they left, they gave lots of gold, clothes, and cows to wise priests. Twenty guards followed, carrying bows, arrows, and other weapons.  Princess Draupadi, her servants, and nurses also went with them.

As they left, the people of their kingdom were very sad. They walked around the Pandavas, crying. They loved Yudhishthira like a father.  They asked, "Where are you going, great king? Why are you leaving us?  Duryodhana and his friends are so mean! They want to hurt you!  You built such a wonderful city, Indraprastha! It's as beautiful as a magical place in heaven! Why are you leaving it?"

Arjuna, the brave warrior, explained, "The king is going to the forest. He will show those bad people that he is good and strong. We need to ask the wise people in the forest for help.  Please go talk to them and ask them to help us."

The people bowed to the Pandavas, feeling sad. They said goodbye to Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Draupadi, and the twins, and went home with heavy hearts.
