Krishna, a very wise and powerful person, spoke to King Yudhisthira and his brothers.  He said, "I always respect Brahmins (priests). They're like gods on Earth, even though sometimes they can be grumpy.  A long, long time ago, a scary monster named Charvaka lived. He did many hard things to please the gods.  He asked for a special gift: to be safe from everyone.  The gods gave him this gift, but with one rule:  He had to be nice to Brahmins.

But Charvaka was mean! He was so strong he scared even the gods!  The gods were very upset. They went to the greatest god of all for help.  The great god said, "I have a plan.  A king named Duryodhana will become Charvaka's friend. Charvaka, because he loves Duryodhana, will be mean to the Brahmins.  The angry Brahmins will curse him, and he will die."

And that's what happened! Charvaka died because he was mean to the Brahmins.  Krishna told Yudhisthira, "Don't be sad. Your family died being brave warriors. They are in heaven now.  Be strong, protect your people, and always respect the Brahmins."
