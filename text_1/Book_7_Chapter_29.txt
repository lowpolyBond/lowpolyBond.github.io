King Dhritarashtra was worried.  He asked Sanjaya, his advisor, what happened on the battlefield.  The Kuru army, Dhritarashtra's army, was losing!

Sanjaya said, "Many brave warriors fought hard for your son, Duryodhana, and their own honor. They followed Drona, their leader.  They fought bravely against the Pandavas, even though they were losing."

The battle was fierce!  The Pandavas were winning, but then they made a mistake.  The Kaurava warriors, seeing this, attacked!  The Pandavas shouted, "Kill Drona!"  The Kauravas shouted, "Don't kill Drona!" It was like a game, with Drona as the prize.

The fighting was terrible.  Heroes fought heroes.  The sound of the battle was deafening!  The Pandavas, remembering all their troubles, fought even harder. They wanted to kill Drona, no matter what.  The battle was so fierce, nobody could remember seeing one like it!  The earth shook!

Drona, a very powerful warrior, was crushing the Pandavas.  But Dhrishtadyumna, the Pandava general, fought back bravely against him.  Their battle was amazing!

Then, Nila, a brave Pandava warrior, fought like a wildfire!  He was burning through the Kaurava soldiers.  Aswatthaman, Drona's son, challenged him.  They fought, and Aswatthaman killed Nila.

The Pandavas were sad.  They were worried because Arjuna, their best warrior, was fighting far away.  They wondered if they could win without him!
