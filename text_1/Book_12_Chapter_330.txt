Once upon a time, after a wise man named Vyasa left, another wise man, Narada, flew down from the sky to see Suka. Suka was busy reading holy books. Narada wanted to know the secrets of the holy books.

Suka greeted Narada with respect and offered him a drink.  Narada smiled and asked Suka, "My dear child, how can I be happy and good?"

Suka replied, "Wise Sanatkumara once told other wise people the way to be happy. He said the best sight is knowledge, the best practice is giving up things you don't need.  Don't do bad things, always do good, and be kind.  Being human is sad, so don't get too attached to things; attachment causes sadness."

Narada continued, "Sanatkumara said we should control our anger and desires. They only cause trouble. Protect your good work from pride, your wisdom from disrespect, and your soul from mistakes. Kindness is the greatest strength, forgiveness is the greatest power, knowing yourself is the greatest wisdom, and truth is the most important thing.  It's always best to speak the truth, but if you can, say something helpful instead."

"He also said," Suka added, "a truly wise person doesn't want much, doesn't hope for things, and isn't tied to the world. They enjoy things without being attached. They are calm, not easily upset, and meditate. They are friendly with everyone but not controlled by them. They understand they're not just their body."

"Sanatkumara said," Narada continued, "being kind to everyone is very important. Don't hurt anyone, be friendly.  Being content, not hoping for things, and being patient will bring you happiness. Let go of your desires, control your senses, and you'll be happy now and later.  Greed causes sadness, so get rid of it!"

"He also said," Suka added, "a wise person lives peacefully, even surrounded by people who are busy with their lives. They are satisfied with knowledge.  Good deeds take you to heaven; mixed good and bad deeds make you human; only bad deeds send you down to be an animal.  Weâ€™re all always getting older and closer to death, it's like being slowly cooked!  You often think something is good when it is bad, or think something is certain when it is not! Wake up!"

"Sanatkumara warned against being attached," Narada said.  "Like a silkworm trapped in its cocoon, we get trapped by our own actions.  People who get too attached to family and possessions will suffer.  It's like a fish caught in a net! Only our good and bad actions go with us after we die. So why get attached to things that won't last? The journey after death is long, dark, and lonely. Only our actions will follow us.  We need wisdom, good deeds, and purity to reach the best place. The desire to stay in this world is like a rope tying us down. Only those who do good can break free.  This world is like a wild river. Our bodies are boats, forgiveness is our oars, truth is our balance, and kindness is our sail. We must let go of good and bad, truth and lies, until we let go of everything, even our understanding.  Then we will understand the truth."

"That's the way to be happy," Suka finished.  "If you are wise, you won't suffer. You'll understand that everything is connected. You won't judge anyone. And you'll be free from all suffering."
