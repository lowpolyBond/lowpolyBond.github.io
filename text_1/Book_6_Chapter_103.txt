Once upon a time, during a great battle, King Dhritarashtra asked his advisor, Sanjaya, "How did Arjuna (the Pandava prince, also called Partha) and his teacher, Drona, fight each other?"

Sanjaya said, "Arjuna and Drona were close friends. But in battle, they fought without thinking of their friendship.  Warriors never hold back in battle! Arjuna shot three arrows at Drona.  Drona didn't even flinch.  Arjuna shot more arrows, and Drona got very angry! He shot many arrows back at Arjuna.  Then, Duryodhana (the Kaurava prince) sent Susarman to help Drona.  Susarman also shot many arrows at Arjuna. Their arrows flew through the air like cranes in the sky.  The arrows hit Arjuna, but he didn't give up.  He roared and fought back.  He hit Susarman and his son with his arrows!  They fought bravely even though they were hurt.  Arjuna was incredibly skillful.  He fought off many, many arrows all at once! The gods and demons watching were amazed!"

"Then," continued Sanjaya, "Arjuna used a powerful wind weapon.  It blew strongly and knocked down many trees and soldiers. Drona used a powerful weapon to stop the wind. Arjuna then defeated the Trigartas' army.  Then, many other warriors – Kripa, Ashwatthama, Salya, and others – surrounded Arjuna.  At the same time, many warriors surrounded Bhima (another Pandava brother) with elephants!  Bhima jumped off his chariot and fought the elephants with his mighty club. He was so strong! He looked like the sun surrounded by clouds. He fought so bravely that the elephants ran away, even crashing into their own friends!"
