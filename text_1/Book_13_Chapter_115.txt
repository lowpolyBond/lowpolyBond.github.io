Once upon a time, King Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, a very important question.  "Grandpa," he said, "you always say that not hurting anyone is the best way to live. But at special ceremonies for our ancestors, we offer meat.  How can we do that without hurting animals?  It seems confusing!"

Bhishma smiled.  "My dear grandson," he said, "let me explain. People who want to be strong, healthy, and live a long life should not hurt animals.  Many wise people have talked about this.  They say that someone who gives up eating meat is as good as someone who does many, many good deeds."

Bhishma told Yudhishthira that even the wisest people in the whole world, the great sages, agreed that not eating meat was very important.  They said that people who don't eat meat are friends to all living things.  Animals trust them, and everyone likes them.

Bhishma explained that eating meat means someone had to hurt an animal to get it.  He said that eating meat even if you didn't kill the animal yourself is still wrong because you are helping someone who did kill an animal.  It's like sharing a cookie you know was stolen.  It's not right, even if you didn’t steal it yourself.

"Giving up meat," Bhishma said, "is like doing a big, big good deed, even better than doing lots of prayers or performing amazing ceremonies!  It’s very hard to give up meat once you like the taste, but it's the best thing you can do."

Bhishma also told Yudhishthira that people who hurt animals often don’t have friends when they need help.  They are like scary wild animals, always in trouble.

He said that only meat from special ceremonies, given to the gods, is okay.  Eating other meat is wrong and could make you sad and sick.  People who are kind to all creatures live long, healthy, and happy lives.  Giving up meat is even better than giving away gold or land!

Bhishma then told Yudhishthira about many great kings who didn’t eat meat, especially during special times of the year.  These kings were known for being kind, happy, and successful.

Finally, Bhishma concluded, "My dear Yudhishthira, not hurting anyone is the greatest religion. It’s the best way to live a good and happy life, and go to heaven!"
