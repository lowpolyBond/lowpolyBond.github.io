Once upon a time, in the land of Bharat, King Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, a very important question.  "Grandpa," he said, "if a Brahmin (a holy man) is very poor, can he do the work of a Kshatriya (a warrior) to survive?"

Bhishma smiled. "Yes, my dear King. If a Brahmin needs food, he can be a warrior in times of trouble."

Yudhishthira asked another question. "But can he also do the work of a Vaisya (a farmer or merchant)?"

Bhishma said, "Yes, he can farm or keep animals for food if he can't be a warrior."

Yudhishthira was still curious. "What things should a Brahmin *not* sell if he wants to go to heaven when he dies?"

Bhishma explained, "A Brahmin should never sell wine, salt, sesame seeds, animals with manes (like horses), bulls, honey, meat, or cooked food.  Selling these things is very bad.  Selling a goat is like selling the fire god! Selling a sheep is like selling the water god!  Selling these things is very wrong."

"But," Bhishma added, "it's okay to trade things fairly.  ‘I give you this, you give me that.’ That's fine.  Taking things by force is wrong."

Later, Yudhishthira asked, "Grandpa, what if everyone fights the king? How can the king protect everyone?"

Bhishma answered, "In times of trouble, everyone should try to be peaceful and calm.  Holy men should pray for the king. They are like the king's strongest supporters."  He continued, "But if robbers attack, everyone can fight back. That's okay."

Yudhishthira wondered, "What if warriors become mean to holy men? Who will protect them?"

Bhishma said, "Holy men are very strong! They can fight back!  Warriors came from holy men, so holy men have power over them." He explained that just as fire melts ice, a holy man can make even the strongest warrior calm down.

He added, "Anyone who protects holy men is doing a very good thing! They will go to heaven.  Even a holy man can fight to protect himself, others, and the people from bad guys."

Finally, Yudhishthira asked, "What if a farmer or even someone who is not a warrior saves people from bad guys? Is that okay?"

Bhishma said, "Yes!  Anyone who helps people in trouble is a hero! They are like a bridge across a river when there's no other way to cross. Everyone should respect them."  He concluded, "A good king protects the good and stops the bad. A king who can't do that is like a cloud that never rains – useless!"
