Once upon a time, the Pandava brothers – Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva – and their mother Kunti were sleeping in a forest.  They woke up and saw a beautiful woman.  She was Hidimva, a Rakshasa (a kind of giant).

Kunti asked Hidimva nicely, "Who are you?  Why are you here?"

Hidimva explained, "I'm the sister of a very mean Rakshasa, Hidimba. He sent me to kill you and your sons. But then I saw your strong son, Bhima, and I fell in love with him! I wanted to help you, but Hidimba came to fight Bhima!"

Just then, the Pandavas saw Bhima and Hidimba fighting!  They were huge and strong, like two angry lions.  Dust flew everywhere, like a forest fire!

Arjuna saw Bhima was getting tired. He smiled and said, "Don't worry, Bhima! We'll help you!"  Bhima said, "I've got this!" But Arjuna worried.  He said, "The sun is rising.  Rakshasas are stronger in the morning.  Finish him quickly!"

Bhima got really angry. He was super strong, just like his father, the wind god! He picked up Hidimba high in the air and spun him around and around. Then he threw him down, saying, "You ate people! You deserve to die!"

Arjuna offered to help, but Bhima was already finished. He crushed Hidimba like he was a twig.  The forest shook with Hidimba’s loud scream!

Everyone was happy!  Arjuna said, "Let's go before Duryodhana finds us!"  So the Pandavas, their mother, and Hidimva, who was now Bhima’s wife, left the forest. They went on an adventure!
