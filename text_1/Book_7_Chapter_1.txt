Once upon a time, during a terrible war, a very strong warrior named Bhishma was killed.  King Dhritarashtra, who was blind, was very, very sad.  He was worried about his sons, the Kauravas, who were fighting against their cousins, the Pandavas.

Dhritarashtra asked his friend Sanjaya, "What happened after Bhishma died? My sons are scared!"

Sanjaya said, "King, after Bhishma fell, both sides stopped fighting for a little while. They gave Bhishma a comfortable bed of arrows. Then, they started fighting again.  But the Kauravas were very scared now.  They were like a flock of sheep without a shepherd in a forest full of lions!"

The Kauravas’ army was like a broken boat in a storm.  They were all very afraid.  Then, they remembered Karna, a very strong warrior.  Everyone shouted, "Karna! Karna! He's the only one who can save us!"

But Karna had made a promise to Bhishma.  He said he wouldn't fight until Bhishma was gone. So, even though everyone wanted him to fight, he didn’t fight for ten whole days!  Dhritarashtra was worried.  He wondered if Karna would save them now. He asked Sanjaya, "Will Karna be brave enough to fight for us and win the war?"  The story of the war went on, and everyone waited to see what Karna would do.
