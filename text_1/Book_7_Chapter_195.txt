King Dhritarashtra asked his advisor Sanjaya, "Sanjaya, Drona, Aswatthaman's father, was killed unfairly in battle by Dhrishtadyumna.  Aswatthaman was a super-strong warrior! He knew all kinds of magical fighting skills. He was incredibly brave and strong, like a mountain or a fire!  He was wise like the wisest teacher and fast like the wind!

Drona, his father, was a great teacher. He taught Aswatthaman everything he knew about fighting.  He wanted his son to be the best warrior ever.  That’s what good teachers do – they share their skills with their children and best students. Aswatthaman learned all the secret fighting moves. He was as skilled as anyone in the whole world!

Now, Aswatthaman heard that his father was killed. He was very angry!  It was like someone killed his best friend and teacher!  He was supposed to kill Dhrishtadyumna, just like Dhrishtadyumna was supposed to kill his father. So, what did Aswatthaman say when he heard this terrible news?  He was furious, and ready to take revenge!"
