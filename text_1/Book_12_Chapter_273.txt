King Yudhishthira asked a very important question: "How do people become bad? How do they become good? How do they give up all their wants? And how do they finally reach freedom from the world?"

His wise uncle, Bhishma, answered: "You already know the answers, my dear nephew, but let me explain it clearly.

Think about this: you see, hear, smell, taste, and touch things.  Sometimes you really want something! You might want a yummy candy or a fun toy. You work hard to get it!  The more you want it, the more attached you become.  Then, you might not want to share it.  You might even do things that aren't nice to get what you want!

This wanting and not wanting makes you unhappy. You start to lie or cheat to get what you want.  You think bad thoughts, say bad things, and do bad things.  Other bad people become your friends. You are not happy, now or later.  That's how people become bad.

But good people are different. They think about making others happy. When you help others, you also become happy.  A good person knows what is right and wrong. They listen to wise people.  They try to be kind and honest.  They want good things, but they get them in a fair way. They make good friends. They are happy now and will be happy later.  They control their wants.

When a good person understands that nothing lasts forever, they start to let go of their wants. They give up the need for things. They don't need lots of toys or candy anymore.  This is called renunciation â€“ giving up what you want. 

Finally, they reach freedom. They are no longer unhappy because of their wants. They have become free! That is called liberation or emancipation.

So, Yudhishthira, always be good!  Being good always brings happiness."
