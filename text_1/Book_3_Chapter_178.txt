Once upon a time, the mighty Bhima, a strong warrior like ten thousand elephants, went for a walk in the forest.  He was so strong, he’d fought and won against lions, tigers, and even elephants! But then, something amazing happened. A giant snake, bigger than any he'd ever seen, grabbed him!

Bhima was surprised. "Who are you?" he roared. "How can you hold me? I'm Bhima, son of Pandu! I'm unbeatable!"

The snake chuckled. "I'm Nahusha, a king who was cursed long ago.  I angered some wise people, and they turned me into a snake! I'm very hungry, and today, the gods have decided you'll be my meal."

Bhima was trapped.  He was very sad.  He thought about his brothers, his mother Kunti, and how worried they would be. He worried about his brothers' safety in the forest. The snake told Bhima that only someone who understood the soul and the world could save him.

Meanwhile, Bhima's brother Yudhisthira felt a shiver run down his spine.  The animals were acting strangely.  Jackals howled, birds cried, and the wind blew fiercely.  Something bad had happened!

Yudhisthira asked, "Where is Bhima?"  He was told that Bhima had gone for a walk.  Yudhisthira knew something was wrong. He followed Bhima's tracks – huge footprints, broken trees, and dead animals along the way!

Finally, he found Bhima in a dark cave.  The giant snake had wrapped its coils around him, holding him tight.  Yudhisthira had to find a way to save his brave brother!
