King Dhritarashtra was very sad.  He asked his advisor, Sanjaya, "How did the great warrior Bhishma die? He was like a powerful bull, strong and brave! My father, who was as strong as the god Indra, fell from his chariot. What happened to my sons after Bhishma, who was so wise and good, was killed?"

Dhritarashtra was heartbroken.  He wondered, "When Bhishma fought, who fought beside him? Who protected him from behind?  Bhishma was like the sun, shining brightly, scaring the enemy. How did the Pandavas fight him? He was so strong, almost unbeatable!"

Bhishma was amazing! He fought bravely for ten days. He was like a huge storm, shooting arrows like rain.  He was so powerful, the Pandavas' army was afraid! But then, even this great warrior fell, like a giant tree blown down by the wind.  Dhritarashtra blamed himself, saying his bad advice led to Bhishma's death.

He asked Sanjaya, "How could the Pandavas defeat Bhishma? He was so strong, even the gods couldn't defeat him easily!  Bhishmaâ€™s friends, Drona and Kripa, were there to help him, and yet he was defeated by Sikhandin! How was this possible?"  

Dhritarashtra was confused and angry. He wanted to know everything: who fought with Bhishma, who protected him, and how the Pandavas managed to win. He said, "Bhishma was like a giant ocean of arrows, impossible to defeat!  He was our protector, and now he is gone.  My army is like lost sheep without a shepherd!"

Dhritarashtra was sad and worried. He knew that the war was based on a game of dice, and he questioned the whole dreadful battle. He wondered about the fate of his sons and the Pandavas. He was deeply hurt by Bhishma's death, and he felt the world had lost its fairness.  He begged Sanjaya, "Tell me everything that happened in the battle, even the bad parts. I need to know what happened to my father, my sons, and my army!"
