Arjuna went on a journey.  He reached the big, big ocean!  The waves were like giant cliffs, crashing and rolling.  Lots and lots of boats filled with shiny jewels were on the water.  He saw big turtles, whales, and other sea creatures swimming around.  Shiny shells looked like stars under the clouds.  Many, many jewels floated on the water.  The wind blew very hard.

Arjuna then saw a city of demons nearby, under the water.  Matali, his chariot driver, zoomed the chariot down and under the earth! The rumbling chariot scared the demons. They grabbed their bows, arrows, swords, and other weapons.  They were afraid!  They shut the city gates tight.

Arjuna blew a giant conch shell.  The sound was so loud it echoed everywhere!  It scared the demons even more.  Thousands of demons, called Nivata-Kavachas, came out! They wore armor and carried lots of different weapons.

Matali drove the chariot so fast, Arjuna couldn't see anything! The demons played loud, strange music. The sound was so loud that even the fishes swam away!

Then, the demons threw hundreds and thousands of sharp arrows at Arjuna!  A huge battle began!  Even powerful magical beings came to watch the fight.  They cheered for Arjuna, just like they cheered for the king of the gods, Indra, in a battle long ago.
