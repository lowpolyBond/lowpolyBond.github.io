Once upon a time, in a land far away, lived Princess Amva.  Her father, the King of Kasi, had many daughters.  Bhishma, a very powerful warrior, took Amva and her sisters, Amvika and Amvalika, away from their home.  Bhishma gave Amvika and Amvalika to his younger brother to be his wives.

Bhishma then let Amva go to King Salwa, a mighty king.  Amva traveled a long way, with wise old men and her nanny to help her.  She told King Salwa, "I've come to be your wife!"

But King Salwa said, "No! You were going to marry someone else.  Bhishma took you away by force, and I don't want a woman who was meant for another man."

Amva cried, "That's not true! Bhishma took me away against my will. I was very sad. I love you, and I only want to be your wife!"

She begged and pleaded, but King Salwa wouldn't change his mind. He was scared of Bhishma.  He kept saying, "Go away! I don't want you. You belong to Bhishma."

Amva was heartbroken.  She said, "Even though you reject me, truth is always strong!  Good people will help me!"

Sadly, Amva left King Salwa's kingdom, feeling very sad and alone.  She cried all the way home.  King Salwaâ€™s decision was very unkind.
