Once upon a time, Yudhishthira, a very good king, asked his wise grandfather Bhishma, "Grandpa, what good things happen to someone who gives sandals to a Brahmin whose feet are burning?"

Bhishma smiled. "My dear boy," he said, "giving sandals helps that person overcome all troubles!  They'll be above all their enemies.  Shiny golden and silver carts pulled by mules will come to them!" He added, "It's like giving a whole fancy chariot with strong horses!"

Yudhishthira then asked, "Grandpa, what about giving sesame seeds, land, cows, and food?"

Bhishma explained, "Sesame seeds are special! They're the best food for our ancestors, the Pitris. Giving them sesame seeds makes the Pitris very happy and keeps you away from a scary place called hell. It's like worshipping the gods!"  He added that even great wise people went to heaven by giving sesame seeds.

Bhishma continued, "Giving land is also wonderful. Even a small piece of land given with kindness helps you avoid bad luck. Giving a good house is even better – it helps you go to heaven!  Giving a shed for cows saves your family from trouble for seven generations!"  He warned, though, not to give bad or unlucky land.

"Cows are very special," Bhishma said.  "They give us milk, butter, and so much more! Giving a cow is like giving a gift of life.  Giving many cows brings great good fortune and keeps you safe from harm."  He added that you shouldn't give cows to just anyone – only to kind and good people.

Finally, Bhishma talked about food. "Giving food to a hungry person is one of the best things you can do.  It's better than giving gold or fancy clothes!  Giving food brings happiness here and in heaven." He said that giving food to a guest is especially good.

"So, Yudhishthira," Bhishma concluded, "giving even small things with a kind heart brings great blessings!"
