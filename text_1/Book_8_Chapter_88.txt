A great battle was about to begin!  The sky was filled with amazing creatures â€“ gods, magical beings, and even flying creatures!  It was a magical sight.  Everyone watching felt excited.  The battlefield was filled with the sounds of music, singing, and laughter, but also the noise of war: horns blowing, soldiers shouting, and elephants trumpeting!

Arjuna and Karna, two mighty warriors, started fighting.  They shot so many arrows that it became dark!  Everyone hid, running to Arjuna or Karna for safety.  Then, the darkness lifted, and the two warriors fought even harder, like the sun and moon shining after a storm.

They fought so fiercely, it looked like a battle between the gods and giants from long ago!  The battlefield was full of brave heroes, but also many dead soldiers.  It was a terrible, but also beautiful, sight.  

Arjuna was incredibly strong. He easily defeated many of Duryodhana's warriors, cutting down their bows, chariots, and even their horses and elephants.  Gods in the sky even blew trumpets to praise Arjuna! Flowers rained down from the sky, too! Everyone was amazed, except Duryodhana and Karna.

Then, Drona's son, Ashwatthama, tried to make peace.  "Duryodhana," he said kindly, "let's stop fighting! Many great warriors are already dead.  Share the kingdom with the Pandavas.  Arjuna is very powerful, but he will listen to me."  Ashwatthama told Duryodhana that the Pandavas were his friends, and that peace was the best option.

But Duryodhana was angry. He remembered how Bhima had killed his brother.  He didn't trust the Pandavas anymore. He thought Arjuna was tired and Karna could still win.  Duryodhana shouted to his army, "Attack! Kill them all!"  The battle raged on.
