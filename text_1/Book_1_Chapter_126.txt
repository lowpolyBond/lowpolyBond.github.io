Long ago, in a faraway land, King Pandu died.  He was a good king, but he left his kingdom to become a holy man.  He lived in the mountains with his wife Kunti and his little sons.

Wise, holy men, like magical wizards, lived on the mountain too.  They saw King Pandu die. They said, "King Pandu left his wife and babies behind. We must take them back to his home."

So, the holy men started walking. They carried King Pandu and his other wife, Madri, who sadly died with him. They also carried Kunti and her sons: Yudhishthira, Bhima, and Arjuna.  Even though Kunti was tired, she felt the journey was short because she loved her sons.

They arrived at the big city of Hastinapura.  Lots and lots of people came out to see them.  There was Bhishma, a strong warrior, and Dhritarashtra, the new king, who was blind, and his many sons, the Kauravas.  Everyone was very respectful of the holy men.

The oldest holy man spoke.  "King Pandu left behind his sons," he said. "Yudhishthira was born with the help of Dharma, the god of righteousness! Bhima is strong, and Arjuna is a great archer.  They also have twin brothers, Nakula and Sahadeva." He explained that Pandu's other wife, Madri, had died with him.  He asked the people to take care of Kunti and her sons.

Then, *poof!* The holy men disappeared! Everyone was amazed!  They all went home, thinking about the good king and his brave sons.
