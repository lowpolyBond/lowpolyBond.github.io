Long ago, a wise man named Parasara told a story about how everyone should live.  He said there were four groups of people:

* **Brahmins:**  They were like teachers and wise people. They studied and learned.
* **Kshatriyas:** They were like kings and soldiers. They protected everyone.
* **Vaishyas:** They were farmers and traders. They grew food and made things.
* **Sudras:** They helped the other groups.  They did important jobs, like cleaning and helping with ceremonies.

Parasara said it was important for everyone to do their job well.  Sudras should work hard and be kind.  Being around good people made everyone better, just like shiny jewels look even brighter next to the sun!

He said that even a small, good deed was better than a big, bad one. A king who stole cows and then gave them away still did something wrong.  It's like taking someone's toy and then giving it to someone else â€“ it's still not right!

Each group had a special job: Brahmins studied, Kshatriyas protected, Vaishyas made things, and Sudras helped. If everyone did their job, everyone would be happy. Happy people make the gods happy too!

Parasara said being good was important.  Even a small, kind gift was better than a big gift given without kindness. Giving to the Brahmins with respect was extra good!

Life is like a big ocean, said Parasara. We all need to find a way to get to the other side, to become good and kind.  Brahmins shone with goodness, Kshatriyas with bravery, Vaishyas with wealth, and Sudras with their clever hard work.  Everyone could shine in their own way!
