Arjuna, the mighty warrior, told King Yudhishthira what happened in battle.  "King," he said, "Drona's son, Ashwatthama, attacked me!  He shot arrows like poisonous snakes.  Lots of soldiers surrounded my chariot. I fought bravely and killed five hundred of them! Then I fought Ashwatthama. He was strong and fought like a brave elephant.  He wanted to save the Kaurava soldiers I was defeating.

Ashwatthama shot so many arrows!  He shot from eight chariots pulled by eight oxen!  It was like a huge raincloud pouring rain!  He shot so fast, I couldn't even see where his arrows came from. He even hit me and Krishna with five sharp arrows each. But I fought back hard and defeated him.  He was hurt badly and covered in blood.  He ran away to hide.

Then, Karna, another strong warrior, arrived with fifty soldiers!  I defeated them all, too, and came to see you. Everyone is scared of Karna, even the Pancalas! Karna is so strong; he killed seventeen hundred soldiers already!

King, you fought Ashwatthama before, and I heard Karna saw you afterward.  I thought you were resting. But Karna is very dangerous. No one can stop him.  Please, let Satyaki, Dhrishtadyumna, Yudhamanyu, and Uttamauja protect my chariot.  I will fight Karna like Indra fought the demon Vritra.  Come watch! Many soldiers are bravely fighting and dying.  If I don't defeat Karna today, I will fail! Please bless me to win!"
