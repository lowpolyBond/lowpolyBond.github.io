Princess Damayanti was very sad.  She missed Nala terribly. She sighed a lot, lost her color, and didnâ€™t eat or sleep.  Her maids told her father, King Bhima, that she was very sick.

King Bhima thought, "My daughter is grown up! It's time for her wedding!"  He decided to have a big party, a Swayamvara, where many kings could come and choose Damayanti as their wife. He sent messages all over the land, inviting everyone.  Soon, many kings came with their elephants, horses, and soldiers. It was a noisy and exciting time!

Meanwhile, two wise saints, Narada and Parvata, visited King Indra, the king of the gods.  They told Indra that all the kings were going to Damayanti's Swayamvara.  Indra, the god king, was curious.

Indra asked, "Where are all these brave kings going?"

Narada explained about Damayanti, saying she was the most beautiful princess in the world. He said all the kings wanted to marry her.

Even the gods wanted to see this beautiful princess!  They decided to go to the Swayamvara too.  But then, they saw Nala.  Nala was incredibly handsome, just like the god of love! The gods were so amazed by him that they forgot about Damayanti.  They asked Nala to help them.  They wanted him to deliver a message.  They left their heavenly chariots and talked to him.
