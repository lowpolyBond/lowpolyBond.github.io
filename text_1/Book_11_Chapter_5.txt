King Dhritarashtra asked Vidura, "Tell me how to handle life's big problems."

Vidura said, "A wise man once got lost in a scary forest.  It was full of roaring lions and other scary animals!  The man was very afraid. His hair stood on end! He ran and ran, but couldn't escape.

The forest was surrounded by a net, and a scary woman stood watching.  Giant snakes, as tall as mountains, guarded it, too.  There was also a deep pit hidden by plants.  The man fell in!

He got stuck, hanging upside down, tangled in vines.  A big snake was at the bottom of the pit, and a six-legged, six-headed elephant was nearby!  Scary bees buzzed around, drinking honey from a tree above the pit.  The man drank the honey that dripped down, but he was still thirsty!

Black and white rats were gnawing at the tree roots.  He was scared of the lions, the woman, the snake, the elephant, the falling tree, and the bees!  Even though things were terrible, he never gave up hope of surviving."
