Once upon a time, after a long night, King Duryodhana told his army, "Get ready to fight!"  His soldiers quickly got dressed in armor.  Some hooked up their horses to their chariots, others ran around getting things ready.  Elephants were prepared for battle, and foot soldiers got their weapons.  Many soldiers even put down carpets on their chariots!  Loud music played to make everyone excited.  The Kaurava army, with their leader, the King of Madras, got into position, ready to fight.

They made a promise: no one would fight alone.  If anyone did, or left a friend in trouble, they'd be in big trouble!  They would all fight together.  The Pandava army also got ready and lined up for battle.  The noise was like a HUGE, roaring ocean!

King Dhritarashtra asked, "Sanjaya, tell me about the deaths of Drona, Bhishma, Karna and my son, Duryodhana. How did Shalya and Duryodhana die?"

Sanjaya said, "King Dhritarashtra, after Drona, Bhishma, and Karna were killed, Duryodhana hoped Shalya would win.  Shalya was a strong warrior, so Duryodhana felt safe. But the Pandavas were still angry after Karna died.  Shalya, brave and strong, fought with his army. Kritavarma was on the left, Kripa on the right, Ashwatthama in the back, and Duryodhana in the middle, with lots of soldiers all around him.

The Pandavas also split into groups to fight. Yudhishthira fought Shalya. Arjuna fought Kritavarma. Bhima fought Kripa. The twins, Nakula and Sahadeva fought Shakuni and Uluka.  It was a huge battle!

Dhritarashtra asked, "After so many great warriors died, how many soldiers were left on each side?"

Sanjaya said, "King, your army still had 11,000 chariots, 10,700 elephants, 200,000 horses, and 3,000,000 soldiers. The Pandavas had only 6,000 chariots, 6,000 elephants, 10,000 horses, and 1,000,000 soldiers.  But even with fewer soldiers, they fought bravely. They were all angry and wanted to win. The battle was fierce and terrible, with everyone fighting hard!"
