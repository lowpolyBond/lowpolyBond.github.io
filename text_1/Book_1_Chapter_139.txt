Once upon a time, after a big contest, Karna's father, Adhiratha (a charioteer), came to see him.  Adhiratha was old and tired; he leaned on a stick. He was so happy to see his son! Karna, who had just won a kingdom, bowed down to his father.  Adhiratha hugged Karna and cried with joy.

Bhima, one of the Pandava brothers, saw this.  He laughed and teased Karna, "Hey, son of a charioteer! You're not even worthy to fight Arjuna! You should be holding a whip, not ruling a kingdom!"

Bhima's words made Karna sad.  But then, Duryodhana, Karna's friend, stood up angrily.  "Bhima," he roared, "a warrior's strength is what matters, not his family! Great heroes come from all sorts of backgrounds.  Even gods have mysterious beginnings!  Karna is a mighty warrior, and he deserves to be king!"

Duryodhana told everyone how amazing Karna was.  The crowd cheered for Duryodhana and Karna.  The sun set, but the arena was still bright with many lamps. Duryodhana took Karna's hand and led him away.  Everyone went home, talking about Arjuna, Karna, and Duryodhana.

Kunti, Karna's mother, saw him.  She knew he was her son because of his special birthmarks.  She was so proud! Duryodhana was happy to have such a strong friend like Karna.  He wasn't scared of Arjuna anymore. Karna was a wonderful speaker, and he made Duryodhana feel even better.  Yudhishthira, another Pandava brother, even thought Karna was the greatest warrior in the world!
