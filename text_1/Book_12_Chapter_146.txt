Once upon a time, a kind pigeon lived in a tree.  A hunter, who caught birds, came to rest under the tree.

The pigeon’s wife told him, "We should be kind to everyone, even our enemies!"

The pigeon was so happy to hear this, he started crying happy tears! He welcomed the hunter warmly. "Welcome!  What can I do for you?  This is your home for now!"

The hunter shivered. "I'm freezing!"

The clever pigeon gathered dry leaves. He flew away and brought back a tiny spark of fire.  He lit the leaves, making a warm fire for the hunter.  "Warm yourself!" he chirped.

The hunter felt much better. "Now I’m hungry," he grumbled.

The pigeon sadly shook his head. "We forest birds eat what we find each day. We don't store food."

The pigeon felt ashamed. He thought hard. Then he smiled.  "I will do something special for you!"

He made another fire. He remembered that wise people said it’s very good to honor guests.  With a happy heart, he walked around the fire three times and then… flew right into the flames!

The hunter watched in shock. "What have I done? This bird gave his life for me! I am so cruel!" The hunter felt terrible about what he had done, and he cried.
