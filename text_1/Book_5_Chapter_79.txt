Once upon a time, a wise old man talked to the Pandava brothers.  He said, "I want to help you and the Kauravas make peace.  Peace is better than war.  But it's like growing crops.  You need both hard work *and* rain.  I can work hard, but I can't control the rain.  Duryodhana, the Kaurava king, is very bad. He's mean and doesn't care about being fair. His friends, Sakuni and Karna, make him even worse.

Duryodhana will never give up his kingdom peacefully. He'll only stop if he's defeated.  Yudhishthira, the good king, won't give up either.  So, sending a message to Duryodhana probably won't work. He's too wicked. He stole your kingdom when you were young! He's always tried to hurt you.  He deserves to be punished.

You know Duryodhana is evil, and you know I want to help Yudhishthira.  Why do you worry about me?  You know war is coming. It was decided a long time ago.

I will try my best to make peace, I'll use words and actions, but it's unlikely.  Even Bhishma tried to make peace before!  Duryodhana wouldn't share even a tiny bit of his kingdom. I have to obey Yudhishthira, and that means thinking about what to do about Duryodhana's evil actions again."
