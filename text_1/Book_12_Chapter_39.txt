The Pandava brothers, Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, and the twins, finally returned to their city!  Thousands of people rushed out to see them. The streets were so full, it looked like a big, sparkling ocean!  The houses were decorated, and ladies peeked out, saying wonderful things about the princes. They especially praised Draupadi, Yudhishthira’s wife, saying, "You did a great job, wonderful princess!"

The city was filled with happy shouts and cheers. Yudhishthira, being a good king, rode through the streets gracefully and then went into the beautiful palace. People greeted him, saying, "You won! You're our king! Rule for a hundred years!"

Yudhishthira went inside, prayed to the gods, and then went back outside.  More people—lots and lots of holy Brahmins—were waiting to bless him. He gave them gifts: sweets, jewels, gold, even cows!  Everyone shouted, "This is a happy day!"  It sounded like a thousand swans singing!

But then, something scary happened. A sneaky demon named Charvaka, who looked like a Brahmin, pretended to speak for all the holy men. He shouted, "You're a bad king! You killed your family! You should die!"

Yudhishthira felt terrible. He bowed his head and said, "I'm sorry! Please forgive me!"

The real Brahmins were shocked! They yelled, "That's a lie! We didn't say that!  It's Charvaka, Duryodhana's friend, trying to trick you!"

The angry Brahmins were so powerful that with a mighty "Hun!" they made Charvaka disappear!  Poof! He was gone.

The Brahmins blessed Yudhishthira and went home. Yudhishthira and his brothers were very happy.  Their victory was complete!
