Once upon a time, there was a king named Dhritarashtra. He married a queen named Gandhari.  They wanted a big family!  Gandhari asked a wise man for a wish.  She wished for one hundred sons, strong and brave just like their father.

The wise man said, "So be it!" But Gandhari waited a very long time – two whole years!  She got worried when she heard that another queen, Kunti, had a baby boy.  Gandhari was so upset, she accidentally hurt her tummy.  A strange thing happened!  Instead of a baby, a hard ball of flesh came out!

The wise man came back. He saw the ball and said, "Don't worry, my magic still works!" He told Gandhari to put the ball in one hundred jars of special butter and wait two years.

Two years later, guess what?  One hundred tiny babies popped out of the jars!  One of these babies was named Duryodhana.  He was a noisy baby – he cried like a donkey!  Everyone was scared because of the strange sounds and bad weather that happened the day he was born.

Wise people said Duryodhana might bring bad luck.  They told Dhritarashtra to leave him, but he loved his son too much. So, Duryodhana stayed.  Soon after, ninety-nine more baby brothers were born to Gandhari!  Dhritarashtra also had another son with a different woman, named Yuyutsu.

Meanwhile, another king named Pandu also had children.  He had five sons with his two wives, Kunti and Madri.  These five brothers were all very good at fighting in chariots.  They were all special because gods helped their mothers have them.  Now you know how Dhritarashtra had many sons, and Pandu had his five!
