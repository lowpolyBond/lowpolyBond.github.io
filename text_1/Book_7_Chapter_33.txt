Once upon a time, in a great battle, the Pandavas needed to defeat Drona's army.  Drona’s army was like a strong, unbreakable circle.  Many brave warriors tried to break through, but they couldn't!  There was Bhima, Satyaki, and many other strong fighters, but Drona was too powerful. He pushed them all back with his amazing arrow shots!

King Yudhishthira was worried.  He looked around for someone strong enough to break through Drona's circle.  He saw his nephew, Abhimanyu – Arjuna’s son – a very brave young warrior. Abhimanyu was super strong and skilled, almost as good as his father and uncle Krishna!

Yudhishthira asked Abhimanyu for help. He explained that only Abhimanyu, Arjuna, Krishna, or Pradyumna could break the circle.  He begged Abhimanyu to try.  Bhima and others promised to follow and help him.

Abhimanyu said he knew how to get *into* the circle. His father had taught him.  But he worried he might not be able to get *out* if things went wrong.  He was a little scared, but he was also brave.

Yudhishthira told him, "Don't worry, we'll all protect you!"  Bhima added, "I'll be right behind you!"

Abhimanyu bravely said, “I’ll go into that circle, even if it's as dangerous as flying into a fire! I will fight for both my father's and my mother's families!”  He promised to fight so bravely that everyone would remember his name.

Everyone cheered for Abhimanyu.  They knew he was very brave to try something so dangerous. Yudhishthira wished him luck and said, "May your strength be even greater!"

Then Abhimanyu told his driver, "Go!  Drive the chariot towards Drona's army!"  And so, the brave young warrior charged into the battle.
