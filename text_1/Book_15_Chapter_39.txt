Once upon a time, after a big battle, King Dhritarashtra, Gandhari, and Kunti (Yudhishthira’s mother) went to live in the forest.  A wise man named Narada told Yudhishthira that Dhritarashtra didn't die in a fire accident.  Dhritarashtra had made a sacred fire in the forest.  The fire spread, and he passed away peacefully near the river Ganga.

Yudhishthira, his brothers, and many people went to the river Ganga. They performed a special water ceremony to honor Dhritarashtra, Gandhari, and Kunti.  They were all dressed simply.  They put Yuyutsu in charge and offered prayers to the water.

Then, Yudhishthira sent some trusted people to the Ganga to properly take care of Dhritarashtra, Gandhari, and Kunti's bodies.  Twelve days later, Yudhishthira held a big ceremony with lots of gifts and food for everyone to remember his relatives. He gave away many things – gold, silver, cows, beds, jewels, and even carriages! He gave especially generous gifts in honor of his mothers.

After the ceremony, Yudhishthira was very sad. He missed his uncle and family very much.  Even though he was the king, he felt very lonely.  But he continued to rule his kingdom.  Narada, the wise man, gave Yudhishthira comfort and then left.  Dhritarashtra had lived three years in the forest and fifteen years in the city before he passed away.  The story of Dhritarashtra’s passing is called the Asramavasika Parvan, and it's important to remember and share.
