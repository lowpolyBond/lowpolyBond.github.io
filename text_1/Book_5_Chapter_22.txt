King Dhritarashtra was worried.  He heard the Pandavas, his nephews, were near the city of Upaplavya.  He sent his trusted friend Sanjaya to meet them.

"Sanjaya," said Dhritarashtra, "go quickly and see how they are.  Tell Ajatasatru, 'It's wonderful you're safe in the city!' Tell all the Pandavas, 'We hope you're well after all your troubles.  You didn't deserve such hardship.'"

Dhritarashtra knew the Pandavas were good and honest. They had earned their wealth through hard work, and they were always kind to him. He never found anything wrong with them.  They were always fair, brave, and controlled their anger, sadness, and joy.  They helped their friends.  Only Duryodhana, his son, and Karna hated the Pandavas.  Duryodhana was silly. He thought he could cheat the Pandavas out of what was rightfully theirs, but the Pandavas were too strong!

Dhritarashtra described the Pandavas' amazing strength.  Arjuna, with his magic bow Gandiva, could defeat anyone!  Krishna, the wisest and bravest of them all, was like a god.  Bhima was super strong, like ten thousand elephants!  The twins, Nakula and Sahadeva, were like fierce hawks in battle.  They had many friends fighting with them, like Dhrishtadyumna and Virata, the King of Matsya, who was grateful for their help.  Even strong kings from faraway lands were on their side!  And everyone was afraid of Krishna's power; even Sishupala, a very powerful king, was defeated by him!

"Sanjaya," Dhritarashtra said, "I'm scared. The Pandavas are too strong.  With Arjuna and Krishna together, they're unbeatable.  My son Duryodhana should make peace with them before it's too late.  Tell Yudhishthira I want peace. Tell Krishna that too.  Yudhishthira always listens to Krishna.  Tell everyone kind words â€“ anything to avoid war!"  Dhritarashtra was worried and he hoped Sanjaya could bring peace.
