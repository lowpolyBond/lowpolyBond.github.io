Once upon a time, after a big wedding celebration, the brave Pandava princes and their friends gathered at King Virata's palace.  The palace was sparkly with jewels and smelled wonderful!  King Virata and King Drupada sat at the front.  Important people like Krishna, Balarama, and their father were there too.  Arjuna, Bhima, the twins Nakula and Sahadeva, and Abhimanyu were all seated with the other princes.  Everyone was dressed beautifully.  It looked like a sky full of shiny stars!

They talked for a while, then looked at Krishna.  Krishna told everyone about how the Pandavas had lost their kingdom to their cousins, the Kauravas, in a game of dice.  He explained how the Pandavas had followed their promise to live in exile for thirteen long years, working hard and enduring many hardships.  Now their exile was over.

Krishna said, "The Pandavas are very fair and would happily share the kingdom, but the Kauravas cheated them!  The Kauravas are strong, but the Pandavas, with their friends, are even stronger.  They could easily win a war, but they only want what is rightfully theirs â€“ half the kingdom."  He said the Kauravas had been very mean to the Pandavas when they were young, and still tried to hurt them.

Krishna told everyone to think carefully about what was fair.  He said the Pandavas were honest and true to their word.  If treated badly again, they might fight back with all their might.  He asked for a wise and kind person to be sent to talk to the Kauravas, to politely ask them to share the kingdom.

After Krishna finished talking, his older brother, Balarama, agreed with him and praised his wise words. Everyone listened and thought about what they should do next.
