Princess Amva was very sad.  She had left her city to marry Prince Salwa.  But Salwa didn't want her anymore!  Amva felt all alone.  She blamed many people: her father, Bhishma (a powerful warrior), and even herself.  "Why didn't I run away during the battle?" she cried.  She felt so angry and heartbroken.

Amva decided to leave everything behind. She went to a forest where wise holy men lived. She told them her whole sad story.  She felt terrible and wanted to become a holy woman, doing special prayers and living simply in the forest to make up for her past mistakes.

One wise holy man, named Saikhavatya, listened to her. He couldn't take away her pain, but he helped her.  He told her that sometimes bad things happen, and that doing good things and praying could make her feel better.  He and the other holy men promised to teach her how to live a simple life and pray in the forest. Amva felt a little bit better knowing she wasn't alone and that she could find peace.
