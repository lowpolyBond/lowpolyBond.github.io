Once upon a time, King Dhritarashtra, who was blind, went to visit his oldest son's home with his sons, the Pandavas.  The Pandavas were five brothers: Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, and the twins, Nakula and Sahadeva. They were very handsome!

Many wise people came to see them.  They wanted to know which Pandava was which.  Sanjaya, a wise man, pointed them out.

He said, "The king, Yudhishthira, has skin as bright as gold, a strong body like a lion, and big, copper-colored eyes.  Bhima, is strong like a wild elephant, with skin like hot gold.  Arjuna, the great archer, has dark skin, is young and strong, and walks like an elephant. The twins look like gods!  And this beautiful lady, with skin like a blue lotus, is Draupadi, wife of the Pandavas."  

Sanjaya then showed them the other ladies.  There was Krishna, Draupadi's friend, who was beautiful like a goddess. There was Subhadra, Arjuna's wife, with skin like the moon.  He showed them many other princesses, wives of the Pandavas and their cousins.  He even pointed out the sad wives of the Kauravas, Dhritarashtra's other sons who had died in war.


After all the wise people left, the old king asked his grandsons how they were doing.  Everyone sat down, the soldiers, the ladies, even the children, and the king asked them all how they were.
