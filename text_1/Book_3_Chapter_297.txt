Once upon a time, a kind king named Dyumatsena lost his sight.  He went to live with wise holy men in a forest.  These wise men kept telling everyone how lucky Dyumatsena's daughter, Savitri, was.

One day, some people from Dyumatsena's kingdom arrived.  They had exciting news!  The bad man who had taken over the kingdom was dead!  His army had run away.  Everyone wanted Dyumatsena back as their king, even though he couldn't see!

The people brought a chariot for the king and his army. They cheered, "Long live King Dyumatsena!"  The holy men blessed the king, and he happily went home with Savitri.

The priests put Dyumatsena back on his throne. His son helped him rule. Savitri was very happy.  She had 100 brave sons and 100 strong brothers! She helped her family become very successful.

The story of Savitri is a wonderful tale. It shows how kindness and good luck can win over bad times.  If you listen to this story carefully, good things will happen to you too!
