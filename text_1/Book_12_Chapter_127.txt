Once upon a time, a very wise Rishi named Rishabha was visiting a special place.  It was a beautiful forest where two holy men, Nara and Narayana, lived.  There was a lovely lake, and a Rishi named Aswasiras always read the holy books there.

Rishabha went to see Nara and Narayana.  Nearby, he saw a very, very tall and thin Rishi. This Rishi was named Tanu, and he was so skinny, he looked like a stick!  He was very, very old and wise.

Rishabha sat with Tanu, and they talked about good things and being kind.  Suddenly, a king named Viradyumna arrived. He was very sad because his son, Bhuridyumna, was missing.  He searched everywhere!  He was so worried he felt like he was going to die.

The king asked Tanu, "What is stronger than hope?  Why can't I find my son?"

Tanu explained that his son had been unkind to another Rishi. The Rishi had asked for a golden jar and some tree bark, but the prince had been mean and refused.  Because of this, the prince was lost.

Viradyumna was very sorry. He knew he had to be kind.  All the other Rishis gathered around to help him.  They all helped him understand and find his son.


The story teaches us to always be kind and to never give up hope, even when things seem very, very hard.
