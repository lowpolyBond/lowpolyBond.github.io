King Yudhishthira, Bhishma explained the four ways people can live their lives.

First, there's **Brahmacharya**.  This is like being a student.  Young people learn the Vedas (holy books) and serve their teacher. They are very disciplined, kind to everyone, even their enemies, and always focus on learning.

Next is **Garhasthya**. This is like being a grown-up with a family.  People get married, have children, and work hard. They need to be kind, honest, and fair. They worship the gods and help others.  They enjoy life but always do what's right.  It's a very important and hard job!

Then comes **Vanaprastha**. This is like retiring to the forest. After a long life of family and work, people leave their homes and go live simply in the woods. They study the holy books and spend time thinking about spiritual things.  They try to connect with the world around them.

Finally, there's **Bhaikshya**. This is like being a wandering holy person. They have no home and ask for food from others. They travel, think deeply, and always try to be good.  They don't want anything for themselves and treat everyone the same.


Bhishma said that each way of life has its own rules and responsibilities.  If you follow them, you will live a good life and be happy, both now and forever.  He even told a story about how a great god said that being honest, kind, helpful, and faithful is the key to a good life.
