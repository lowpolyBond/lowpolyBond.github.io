Yudhishthira was sad. He told his grandpa Bhishma, "Grandpa, you said being good is important. But what about hope?  I had hoped Duryodhana would stop fighting.  But he didn't!  Hope is so big, like a huge mountain, or even bigger than the sky! It's hard to understand and even harder to lose.  What is stronger than hope?"

Bhishma said, "I'll tell you a story.  Long ago, King Sumitra went hunting. He shot a deer with an arrow. The deer was strong and fast! It ran and ran. King Sumitra chased it. He ran across rivers and through forests. The deer was tricky. It would let the king get close, then run far away.  The king kept shooting arrows, but the deer always escaped.  Finally, the king shot his best arrow.  But the deer laughed! It ran so far away that the arrow fell to the ground.  The deer ran into a big, thick forest, and the king still followed!"
