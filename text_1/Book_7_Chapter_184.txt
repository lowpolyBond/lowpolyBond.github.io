The big battle between the Pandavas and the Kauravas raged on.  Yudhishthira, the Pandava king, wanted to defeat the Kauravas, but he couldn't kill Karna himself.  That night, Karna had killed a powerful Pandava warrior named Ghatotkacha. Yudhishthira was very angry and sad.

He told his army, "Let's attack Drona! He's the Kauravas' strongest warrior."  He ordered all his best fighters – Dhrishtadyumna, Sikhandin, Nakula, Sahadeva, Draupadi's sons, and many more – to attack Drona together.  They all rushed towards Drona, wanting to defeat him.

Drona was a great warrior, and he fought bravely.  Duryodhana, the Kaurava king, helped Drona. The battle was fierce and lasted all night!  Both sides were very tired.  The soldiers were so sleepy, some even fell asleep on their horses or elephants!  Some even accidentally hurt their own friends while they were sleeping.

Arjuna, a brave Pandava warrior, saw everyone was exhausted. He shouted, "Everyone is tired and sleepy! Let's rest for a while. We can fight again when the moon rises."

The soldiers agreed. They all fell asleep wherever they were – on the ground, on their chariots, or on their elephants.  The battlefield looked like a painting of sleeping warriors!

When the moon came up, it was bright and beautiful.  It woke the sleeping soldiers. Then, the battle started again, with both sides determined to win.
