The night ended, and Duryodhana, the Kaurava king, got ready for war. He had a HUGE army!  He divided his soldiers, elephants, chariots, and horses into three groups: best, good, and okay.

His chariots were super strong! They had extra wood for repairs, lots of arrows, tough leather covers, sharp spears, and even pots filled with poisonous snakes!  They also had things to throw hot stuff, like tar, and stones at the enemy. Some chariots even had bells that jingled! The chariots were decorated with gold and jewels and pulled by four strong horses. Each chariot had several drivers.

His elephants were amazing too!  Each one carried seven brave soldiers – some with hooks, some with bows and arrows, some with swords, and one with a spear and a trident. They were covered in bells and jewels, and looked like giant, jeweled hills!

Duryodhana also had many, many horses and soldiers on foot.  The horses were well-trained and shiny with gold decorations. The soldiers wore strong armor and carried all kinds of weapons.

He even had a special reserve army, ready to help if anyone got into trouble.

Duryodhana's army was enormous – way more than the Pandavas' army!  He had amazing leaders too, like Kripa, Drona, Karna, and many others.  He talked to them every day and showed them how much he respected them.  Every single soldier wanted to fight hard for their king!
