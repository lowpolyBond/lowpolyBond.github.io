Once upon a time, there was a great warrior named Pradyumna. He was very brave, but he had been hurt badly in a battle.  His charioteer, Daruka's son, had left the battle because Pradyumna was injured.

But Pradyumna got better! He told his charioteer, "I'm ready to fight again!  Drive me back into battle!"

The charioteer didn't hesitate. He whipped the horses, and they flew! They ran so fast, they seemed to be flying! They zipped around, up and down, and all over the battlefield, so fast nobody could believe it.

Salwa, a powerful enemy, saw this.  He was angry! He shot arrows at the charioteer, but the charioteer didn't even flinch!  Then Salwa shot many arrows at Pradyumna, but Pradyumna was too quick! He sliced the arrows in half with his sword!

Salwa tried magic! He shot even more arrows, but Pradyumna was amazing. He used his special weapon, and shot arrows right back!  He hit Salwa, and Salwa fell down, unconscious!

Suddenly, gods appeared! They told Pradyumna, "Stop! Don't kill Salwa!  Only Krishna can kill him."

Pradyumna listened to the gods. He put away his arrow.  Salwa, hurt and scared, ran away as fast as he could. He zoomed off in his magical chariot and disappeared into the sky!

Pradyumna and his charioteer returned to their side, victorious, even though they didn't kill Salwa. They had shown everyone how brave and skillful they were!
