Suka asked his grandpa, Vyasa, "Grandpa, what's the most important thing to do in the whole world?"

Vyasa said, "My dear Suka, I'll tell you a very, very old secret.  It's about controlling our minds and bodies.  Listen carefully!

Imagine your senses – your eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin – are like playful puppies.  They like to run around and get into trouble.  Your mind is like a good shepherd, keeping those puppies from getting into mischief.  The best thing you can do is to train your mind to focus on good things, not bad things.  That's the most important job of all.

Think of it like this: your mind and senses are like horses.  Usually, they run wild. But if you train them, they'll be calm and steady.  When they're calm, you can see your true self, your inner light, like a bright shining star. Wise people see this inner light.

It's like a big tree with lots of leaves and fruit. The tree doesn't know exactly where each leaf or fruit is.  We are like that tree. We don’t know everything about ourselves. But inside, we have a special part that sees everything.  It's like a light that shows you who you really are.

Life is like a river. It flows and flows, sometimes calm, sometimes wild.  The five senses are like crocodiles, always wanting to grab things.  Bad thoughts are like weeds in the river.  Good thoughts, like kindness and truth, are like clear, clean water.  It’s a tricky river to cross!

But if you use your wisdom and understanding, you can cross it.  Then, you'll be free from worry, and you’ll be happy and at peace. You'll see the world as a bird sees it from high above, not getting angry or sad about small things.

This secret is so important, it should be passed down from parent to child.  It’s a secret only for those who are kind and good and try their best to control their feelings and actions. This knowledge is like the biggest mystery ever, but also the best secret to have!

It's about understanding that the most important thing is to see beyond your body. You are more than just your body. You are eternal and amazing, and there's nothing to fear.  And this is true for everyone, boys and girls alike. Knowing this will set you free."

Vyasa smiled, “This is the best advice anyone could ever give.  Follow it, and you'll find true happiness.”
