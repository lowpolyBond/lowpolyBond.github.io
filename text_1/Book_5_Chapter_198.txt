One sunny morning, Duryodhana, a prince who wanted to fight, gathered a HUGE army.  All the kings had taken baths, worn their best white clothes, and put flowers in their hair. They prayed and got blessings from wise people.  Each king had his own special flag. They were all strong, brave, and knew a lot.  They wanted to win the great battle!

First came Vinda and Anuvinda, and other brave warriors from faraway lands, led by Bharadwaja's son. Then came even MORE warriors!  There was Aswatthaman, Bhishma, and Jayadratha.  Kings from the south, west, and the mountains came too!  Sakuni and other leaders from the east and north joined, along with fighters from many other places.  All these amazing warriors were ready for battle!

Next came Kritavarman, the Trigartas king, and Duryodhana himself, with his brothers and many other powerful kings.  They all marched behind the brothers.  Duryodhana and his family made a HUGE camp on the battlefield, Kurukshetra. It was so big and fancy, it looked just like their own city, Hastinapura!  It was five yojanas (that's a really, really long distance!) across.

The camp had thousands of tents filled with food for all the soldiers, elephants, and horses. Duryodhana even made sure there was food and places to stay for everyone else: the singers, the cooks, the traders, everyone who came to watch the big battle!  He was ready for a big fight!
