Bharata went to a big meeting.  Wise men, dressed in beautiful clothes, were there.  It looked like a bright, starry night!

The wise Vasishtha spoke to Bharata.  "Your father, King Dasaratha, loved everyone. He left this kingdom to you. Your brother, Rama, always does what's right. He obeyed his father. Now, you should rule this land!  Many kings will give you gifts!"

But Bharata was sad.  He knew Rama was the oldest brother, and he should be king.  Bharata said, "How can I be king when Rama is so good? He's learned and kind.  The kingdom belongs to him! I belong to him!"

Bharata was upset. He felt it was wrong to take Rama's place.  He said, "If I take the kingdom, it will be a terrible sin! Rama is the true king, even better than me!"

Everyone at the meeting cried, because they loved Rama too.  Bharata said, "I'll go to the forest and bring Rama back!  I'll even live there with him if I can't convince him to come!"

Bharata asked Sumantra to get the army ready.  Everyone was happy to help.  They wanted Rama back!  Wives told their husbands to go quickly.

Soldiers rode horses and elephants. Carts rumbled.  Bharata got ready to go. He wanted to bring Rama home!  He told Sumantra to get his chariot ready.

Sumantra did as he was asked.  People brought all kinds of animals—camels, mules, elephants, and strong horses—to help.  Bharata was going to bring Rama back to be king!
