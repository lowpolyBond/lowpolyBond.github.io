Rama and Sita, with big, bright eyes, were very happy.  They had talked to a wise man named Vasishtha. Now, they were praying to God Narayana. Rama put butter in a special fire. Then, he and Sita ate a little bit of the food from the offering and sat down to think quietly about God.  They went to sleep in the temple.

Before sunrise, they woke up.  They told their helpers to clean and decorate the palace.  They listened to stories of their family, which made them very happy. Then they prayed.  When the sun came up, they bowed to God in the sun. They asked some wise people to say special prayers for peace.

The prayers and the sound of drums filled the whole city of Ayodhya. Everyone knew Rama and Sita were praying.  They were all very happy!

The people decorated the city for Rama's big day. They put up trees and flags everywhere.  There were bright flags on tall buildings, houses, and even shops. Actors and dancers sang and played music.  Everyone was talking about Rama becoming king! Even the children were excited!

The streets were filled with flowers and sweet smells.  They put out lights so the streets would be bright for Rama’s big parade.

The people all gathered together. They were so happy about King Dasaratha, Rama’s father.  “King Dasaratha is a good king!” they said.  “He’s getting old, but he’s making Rama the new king. Rama is kind, smart, and good. We love him!”

People from far away came to see Rama become king.  Ayodhya was full of people! It was like the ocean, full of happy sounds! It was a beautiful day!
