Once upon a time, there was a wise man named Vrishaspati.  He had a wife, and they had seven children: six sons and one daughter.  These weren't ordinary children; they were all special fire spirits!

One son, Sanju, was a very good and holy fire.  People made special offerings to him during big celebrations.  His wife, Satya, was incredibly beautiful.  Sanju had a son who was also a fire spirit, and three daughters who were very good.

Another of Vrishaspati's sons was Bharata.  People offered special gifts to him too, at the full moon.  Bharata had a son, also named Bharata, and a daughter named Bharati.

Another son, Bharadwaja, was also a special fire.  His wife, Vira, had a son who was like a sacred drink called Soma. This son was also known by many other names.

Vrishaspati had another son who was called Viswajit.  He was like the fire in our stomachs that helps us digest our food! Another son, Viswabhuk, was a very good and holy fire. His wife was a river!

Then there was Vadava, a powerful fire spirit. He was special because he moved upwards. Another son, Swishtakrit, made offerings to the gods better.  And the last son, Manyauti, was a fiery and angry spirit.

Vrishaspati's daughter, Swaha, was a powerful fire spirit, too! She was in everything! Because of her special powers, she had three sons:  One was the most handsome fire spirit in the whole wide world; one was a brave and strong warrior fire; and one was a peaceful fire that brought everyone peace.


So, Vrishaspatiâ€™s family was full of amazing and powerful fire spirits, each with its own special job and personality!
