Once upon a time, after a big battle, a brave warrior named Karna was killed.  King Duryodhana, who was on Karna's side, was very sad. He cried, "Oh, Karna! Oh, Karna!"  He and his few remaining soldiers went back to their camp, feeling very upset.

Even though some people tried to comfort him, Duryodhana was still determined to fight. He chose a new leader named Shalya.  Then, a huge battle happened! It was like a fight between the good gods and the bad giants.  Many soldiers died.  Shalya, the new leader, was also killed.

Duryodhana, all alone and scared, ran and hid in a lake.  But a strong warrior named Bhima found him. Bhima caught Duryodhana and defeated him.

Three soldiers were still fighting for Duryodhana's side – Ashwatthama, Kripa, and Kritavarma.  They were angry and fought through the night.

The next morning, a man named Sanjaya came back to the city. He was very sad. He told everyone that Duryodhana was dead. Everyone cried.  The whole city was filled with sadness.  Sanjaya told King Dhritarashtra (Duryodhana's father) all the bad news:

“King Shalya is dead.  Shakuni, Uluka, and many other soldiers are dead too. All the soldiers from the east, west, north, and south are gone. Duryodhana is dead.  Almost everyone on your side is dead! Only a few are left alive.”

King Dhritarashtra was heartbroken. He fell to the ground, very upset.  His wife, Gandhari, and many other people also cried.  Vidura, a wise man, tried to comfort the king.  Dhritarashtra was so sad that he fainted many times.  He asked everyone to leave him alone so he could be by himself.

Everyone was very, very sad at the end of the great war.
