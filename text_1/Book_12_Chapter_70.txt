King Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandpa, how can a king be happy and successful, both now and after he dies?"

Bhishma smiled.  "My dear Yudhishthira, a king should follow 36 good rules!  These rules will help him be a great and kind ruler."

Bhishma explained: "A good king is kind and fair. He earns money honestly, not by hurting others. He enjoys life but isn't greedy. He speaks kindly and bravely, but never boasts. He gives gifts, but only to those who deserve them. He makes friends carefully, avoiding bad people. He keeps secrets and never uses trickery. He praises others, not himself. He takes taxes only from those who can afford it. He never punishes anyone without being sure they are wrong. He keeps his promises and is trustworthy, except to those who have hurt him. He loves his family and is always clean. He eats healthy food. He respects his elders and prays to the gods. He works hard but never does anything shameful. He is always polite and helpful. He’s smart and waits for the right time to act. He’s always kind. Once he helps someone, he doesn't forget them. He never hits anyone without thinking. He doesn't get too sad when he wins a battle. He gets angry only when he needs to. He's gentle but firm with those who do wrong."

Bhishma said, "A king who follows these rules will be happy and will go to heaven when he dies.  A king who doesn't follow these rules will be in great danger."

Yudhishthira, a very good listener and a clever king, listened carefully. He bowed to his grandfather and promised to rule his kingdom by these rules, with the help of his strong brothers, Bhima and the others.
