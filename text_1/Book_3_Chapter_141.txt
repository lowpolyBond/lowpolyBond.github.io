The Pandava brothers were traveling with the wise Lomasa.  Lomasa pointed to a beautiful river.  "This is the Alakananda River," he said. "It's a very special river!  Gods and wise people come here to pray.  Even the sun and moon visit it!"  He explained that Lord Shiva, a powerful god, stood under the river's source.  The brothers bowed respectfully to the river.

Then, they saw something huge and white in the distance. It looked like a giant mountain! Lomasa explained, "That's not a mountain.  Those are the bones of Naraka, a powerful demon!"

Naraka wanted to be the king of the gods. He was very strong and mean, and he scared the real king of the gods, Indra. Indra was worried, so he asked Vishnu, the most powerful god of all, for help.

Vishnu appeared, and he was so bright that even the god of fire, Agni, seemed dim.  Indra told Vishnu about Naraka. Vishnu easily defeated Naraka with just one touch!  Narakaâ€™s bones are what you see, Lomasa said.

Yudhishthira, the oldest Pandava brother, asked about another amazing thing Vishnu did.  He wanted to know about the time the Earth sank!

Lomasa said, "Long ago, so many people lived on Earth that it became too heavy.  The Earth sank down, down, down!  It was in so much pain!  The Earth asked Vishnu for help."

Vishnu changed into a giant boar with one big tusk. He was so strong he lifted the entire Earth back up!  The gods were amazed and scared at the same time.  They went to see Brahma, the creator god, and he told them that Vishnu, the powerful god, had saved them.

The gods went to see Vishnu and thanked him.  He was resting in a beautiful garden. He was still shining like a mighty boar, even after saving the Earth.  The gods went home, and the Pandavas, having heard this amazing story, continued their journey.
