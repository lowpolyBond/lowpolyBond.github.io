Once upon a time, King Yudhishthira asked the wise Vyasa, "Tell me about great kings of the past! What amazing things did they do?"

Vyasa said, "There was a king named Srinjaya.  He had a beautiful daughter.  Two wise men, Narada and Parvata, visited his palace.  Parvata asked, 'Whose amazing daughter is this?' Srinjaya said, 'She's mine!'  Narada then said, 'King, give me your daughter to be my wife!'  Srinjaya happily agreed.

But Parvata was angry! He shouted, 'I wanted to marry her first! You can't go to heaven now!'  Narada shouted back, 'I followed all the marriage rules!  You can't go to heaven without me!'  They both cursed each other.

Srinjaya wanted a son.  He was very kind and gave lots of food and clothes to the wise men.  They were happy and asked Narada to give Srinjaya a special son.  Narada gave Srinjaya a magical son named Suvarnashthivin.  Everything this boy touched turned to gold!  The king's palace, his clothes, even his poopâ€”all were gold!

Some greedy robbers heard about the golden boy. They stole him, killed him, and cut him into pieces.  But they didn't find any gold! The magic was gone.  The robbers fought and died too.  King Srinjaya was very sad.

Narada came to comfort him.  He told him about another great king, Marutta.  King Marutta was super generous. He gave away all his gold and riches to the wise men and the poor.  He had amazing parties with the gods!  Even though Marutta was so great, he still died.  Narada said, "Your son didn't give anything away.  Don't be sad. Even the greatest kings die."
