Rama and Sita were going to live in the forest.  Lakshmana, Rama's brother, was very sad.  He cried, "I'm coming with you!  I'll protect you from the scary animals!"

Rama didn't want Lakshmana to come. He said, "Lakshmana, who will take care of Mother Kaushalya and Mother Sumitra while we're gone?  Our stepmother, Kaikeyi, might not be nice to them."

Lakshmana said, "Brother, I'll take care of them!  I'll be your helper! I'll carry your things, find food, and keep you safe!"

Rama loved Lakshmana very much.  He said, "Please ask Mother Sumitra if you can come.  And please bring my special bow and arrows from Sage Vasishtha’s house."

Lakshmana went to say goodbye to his family and brought Rama’s special weapons.

Then Rama said, "Let's give all our things to the poor and the wise people before we leave for the forest.  Let's ask Suyajna, Vasishtha's son, to help us."  

So Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana got ready for their big adventure in the forest.
