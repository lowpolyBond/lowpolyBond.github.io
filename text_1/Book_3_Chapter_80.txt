Once upon a time, after the brave Arjuna left the Kamyaka forest, his brothers, the Pandavas, were very sad.  They missed him terribly!

It was like a beautiful necklace without its best pearl, or birds without wings. The forest felt empty without Arjuna, who was as strong as the god Indra.  He was their biggest protector, like Vishnu protects the gods.

The Pandavas felt lonely.  They hunted animals and gave the meat to the priests, but their hearts were heavy.  Draupadi, their wife, was especially upset.  She missed Arjuna dearly.  She told Yudhishthira, "Without Arjuna, this forest doesn't feel beautiful. Everything looks sad."

Bhima, the strong one, agreed.  He told Draupadi that without Arjuna, the sun seemed to be missing from the sky!  He missed Arjuna's strong arms and the way he fought bravely.

Nakula was also sad. He remembered all the amazing things Arjuna had done, like winning horses and giving them to their king as a gift. He couldn't imagine life in the forest without his brother.

Sahadeva felt the same way. He remembered how Arjuna won many battles, even defeating the whole Yadava army!  He missed seeing Arjuna's empty bed in their home in the forest.

All the Pandava brothers missed Arjuna very much.  The Kamyaka forest felt empty without their brave warrior brother. They felt like they needed him to be happy again.
