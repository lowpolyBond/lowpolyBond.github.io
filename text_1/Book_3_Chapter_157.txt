Once upon a time, after defeating a scary monster, the Pandava brothers – Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva – went back to their quiet home in the forest.

Yudhishthira missed his brother Arjuna.  He called a meeting with his brothers and Draupadi.  "Arjuna said he'd be gone for five years," Yudhishthira explained. "He's learning to be a great warrior!  He'll meet us at Mount Sweta, a beautiful mountain full of flowers, birds, and animals. Let's go there to meet him!"

They went to wise holy men for blessings. The holy men said, "Your journey will bring you good luck!"

So Yudhishthira, his brothers, and the holy men started their long trip.  Sometimes they walked, sometimes they rode on the backs of friendly monsters!  They passed Mount Mainaka and Mount Gandhamadana, and finally, after seventeen days, reached the big, snowy Himalayas.

They found a kind, wise king named Vrishaparva living in a beautiful place near waterfalls. They stayed with him for seven days. Vrishaparva treated them like his own sons!  Before they left, they gave him some of their things to keep safe. Vrishaparva gave them good advice and even walked a little way with them to make sure they were okay.

They continued their journey, climbing up the mountain paths, past all sorts of animals. After four days, they finally reached Mount Sweta. It looked like a giant golden cloud!  They followed Vrishaparva’s directions and found their way easily.

Next, they entered the amazing forest of Gandhamadana. It was even more beautiful than they'd ever imagined!  Everywhere were colorful birds singing, sweet-smelling flowers, and trees full of delicious fruits.  They saw peacocks dancing, monkeys playing, and elephants splashing in lakes filled with beautiful lotus flowers.  The air smelled wonderful!

Yudhishthira was amazed. "Bhima," he said, "look at this magical place!  It's so beautiful it's like being in heaven!"

They saw many wonderful things: sparkling rivers, colorful birds, and amazing flowers. They even saw Gandharvas and Kimpurushas (magical beings!) on the mountaintops.

They were very happy and amazed by the beauty of the mountain. After a while, they found another wise holy man, Arshtishena, and visited his simple home.  He looked very thin and holy.  Their adventure was far from over!
