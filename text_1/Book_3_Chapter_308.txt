Once upon a time, a powerful warrior named Karna lived. He was very strong, and had magical armor and earrings that made him almost impossible to defeat!

One day, a wise-looking man appeared.  It was actually Indra, the king of the gods, in disguise! Indra wanted Karna's magical armor and earrings.

Indra asked Karna for a gift. Karna, being very generous, offered him gold, beautiful women, and lots of cows and land.  But Indra only wanted the armor and earrings.

Karna said, "I can't give you these! They are part of me, and they keep me safe!"  He offered Indra everything else he owned, but Indra still wanted the special armor and earrings.

Indra explained that he needed them to win a big battle.  He finally offered Karna a powerful weapon in exchangeâ€”a magical spear!  This spear could kill only one enemy, but it would be very powerful.

Karna thought about it. He knew losing his armor and earrings would make him weaker, but he wanted that powerful spear.  So he agreed.

With a sad heart, Karna took off his magical armor and earrings.  Everyone watched, amazed.  The gods were happy; they celebrated.

Karna got the spear and the gods took the armor and earrings. He was now vulnerable.  But he also had a super-powerful weapon!

The Pandavas, Karna's enemies, were very happy to hear about this. They knew Karna was now much weaker. They knew this would give them a great advantage in the coming battle!

After a long time in the forest, the Pandavas returned home. They were happy to be back and knew they could use their advantage, after hearing what happened to Karna.
