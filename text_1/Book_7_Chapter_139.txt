King Dhritarashtra was very sad.  Many of his soldiers were dying.  He said, "Sanjaya, my army is losing!  Arjuna is so strong! He's fighting with Bhima and Krishna.  They're unstoppable!  Even the best soldiers can't stop them!  I'm worried about the king of Sindhu. If Arjuna sees him, he's in danger. I think he's already dead."  Dhritarashtra asked Sanjaya, "Tell me what's happening in the battle! Tell me about Satyaki, Arjuna's brave friend."

Sanjaya said, "King Dhritarashtra, Satyaki is amazing! He's like a strong elephant crashing through a field of flowers! He's fighting for Arjuna. He's roaring and making the enemy army tremble.  Another king, Alamvusha, tried to stop him. They fought a huge battle! Everyone stopped fighting to watch. Alamvusha hit Satyaki with many arrows. But Satyaki was too strong! He cut the arrows before they could hurt him.  Alamvusha shot more arrows, and they hurt Satyaki. Then, Satyaki got angry. He killed Alamvusha's horses! Then, with one arrow, he cut off Alamvusha's head! After that, Satyaki kept fighting, destroying the enemy army. He was unstoppable!  He was surrounded by many soldiers, but he fought them all! Then he killed Duhsasana's horses. Arjuna and Krishna were very happy to see Satyaki fighting so bravely!"
