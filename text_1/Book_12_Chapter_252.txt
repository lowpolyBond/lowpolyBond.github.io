Once upon a time, a wise teacher named Vyasa was talking to his student. He wanted to teach the student about the soul and how to reach enlightenment.  He started by explaining what makes up everything in the world.

He said, "Imagine everything is made of five basic things: space, wind, fire, water, and earth.  Think of it like a recipe!"

Space is like an empty box.  Our ears hear because of space.

Wind is like the air we breathe.  Our legs move because of wind, and we can feel things because of wind too.

Fire is like the warmth inside us, and the light from the sun. Our eyes see because of fire.

Water is like the liquids in our bodies, like blood. Our tongues taste because of water.

Earth is like the solid parts of our bodies, like our bones and skin. Our noses smell because of earth.

Vyasa said, "Besides these five, everything also has three other things: ignorance, desire, and actions.  And then there's our mind, which sometimes doubts things, and our understanding, which helps us know what's true.  Finally, there's the soul – the real you – that's bigger than anything else,  the most important part of all.”

He added, “The soul becomes connected to a body because of what we do.  But if you can see that every living thing is pure and good, even though it's made of all these things, you won't have to worry about making mistakes anymore. You’ll have reached enlightenment!"
