Once upon a time, Arjuna, a great warrior, talked to King Yudhishthira.  Yudhishthira was quiet.  Then, a wise man named Vyasa spoke.

Vyasa said, "Arjuna is right, Yudhishthira.  Your duty is to rule your kingdom. You can't just leave and go live in the forest.  Lots of people depend on you!  Gods, your ancestors, guests, and even your servants need you to look after them.  Animals and birds also need people to protect them.  Ruling is the hardest job, but it's the most important."

Vyasa explained that kings should be strong and fair. They should be wise and kind, but also know when to punish people who do wrong.  He said, "Kings who are too peaceful get eaten up by the world, like a mouse eaten by a snake!"

Vyasa told a story about a great king named Sudyumna.  Two brothers, Sankha and Likhita, lived near a river. Likhita ate some of Sankha's fruit without asking.  Sankha was angry but told Likhita to go to King Sudyumna and accept punishment.

Likhita went to King Sudyumna and told him what he did. Sudyumna could have forgiven him, but instead, he followed the rules and cut off Likhita's hands.  

Likhita went back to his brother. Sankha wasn't mad anymore.  He told Likhita to pray by the river.  Miraculously, Likhita grew two new hands!  Sankha explained that his prayers and Sudyumna's fair punishment made this happen.

Vyasa said, "King Sudyumna became famous because he was a fair and just ruler.  That's what kings should do â€“ rule wisely and fairly, not just give up everything!"  He told Yudhishthira, "Don't be sad.  Your duty is to rule, not to run away."
