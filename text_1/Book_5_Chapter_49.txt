Long ago, in a great meeting of kings, Bhishma told Duryodhana a story.  He said, "Once, many important gods went to see Brahma, the creator.  Even the wind gods, fire gods, and sun gods were there!  Then, two amazing men, Nara and Narayana, left without bowing to Brahma."

Everyone wondered who they were. Brahma said, "They are very powerful and holy. They fight bad guys, the Asuras, and help the good gods."

Bhishma continued, "The gods, led by Indra, the king of the gods, asked Nara and Narayana for help. They were fighting the Asuras! Nara and Narayana agreed to help."

"Nara was incredibly strong," Bhishma said. "He defeated tons of Asura enemies!  He was like a whirlwind on his chariot, even cutting off the head of a giant Asura trying to eat him!"

Bhishma explained that Nara and Narayana were actually Arjuna and Krishna, two great heroes fighting in the war!  "They are incredibly powerful," Bhishma said. "They are like one soul in two bodies. They are reborn again and again to fight evil."

Bhishma warned Duryodhana, "When you see Krishna and Arjuna together, remember this story! They're unstoppable!  Your bad decisions will lead to a terrible war."

Karna, a warrior on Duryodhana's side, boasted, "I will defeat the Pandavas (Arjuna and his brothers)!"

But Bhishma said, "Karna is not nearly as strong as Arjuna!  He brags a lot, but he's not very brave. He didn't help when the Pandavas were in trouble. Remember when Arjuna was very brave and the Pandavas won?"

Then, Drona, another wise warrior, also told Duryodhana to make peace with the Pandavas.  But Duryodhana ignored them both.  He didn't want peace.  He thought he was strong enough to win the war. Because of his bad choices, a great war was about to begin!
