Prince Bharata rode into Ayodhya in his rumbling chariot.  The city was sad and quiet.  All the doors were closed.  It was dark and gloomy.

Ayodhya used to be bright and happy.  Now, it was like a dried-up riverbed, empty and lifeless.  Or like a fire that's gone out, leaving only ashes.  It was like a battlefield after a big fight, with everything broken and scattered.  Or a beautiful necklace with all its jewels gone.

The streets were empty.  The shops were closed.  There was no laughter or singing.  It was like a party after everyone went home, just leftover mess.  Or a pond with no water left, just cracked earth.

Bharata was very sad. He said to his driver, Sumantra, "Look at our city! It's so quiet now.  No one is wearing flowers or singing songs.  There are no happy sounds of chariots and elephants. Everything is dark and sad since Rama left."

Bharata cried.  He went into the palace, which felt empty without his father, the king. The palace was dark and silent, like a cave without a lion.  Bharata cried a lot, just like the gods cry when something bad happens.
