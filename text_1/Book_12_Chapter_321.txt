Once upon a time, in a faraway land, a king named Janaka ruled Mithila. He was a very good king, wise and kind, and he studied a lot about life and how to be free from worries.  Yudhishthira, another king, wondered if it was possible to be truly free while still living a normal life.

Bhishma, a wise old man, told him a story.  The story was about King Janaka and a wise woman named Sulabha.  Sulabha was a holy woman who traveled the world. She heard that Janaka was very wise and wanted to meet him to test his wisdom.

Sulabha used her special powers to change her appearance. She became incredibly beautiful! She went to Mithila and pretended to be a beggar. King Janaka welcomed her, gave her food, and treated her kindly.

Then Sulabha asked Janaka, "Are you truly free from all your worries, as everyone says?"  Janaka explained that he had learned from a great teacher, Panchasikha, how to live without being attached to things. He said he could be happy even though he was a king.  He explained that true freedom wasnâ€™t about giving up everything, but letting go of wanting things too much.

Sulabha, secretly using her special powers, tried to test Janaka. She didn't use force, just her wisdom.  She pointed out that Janaka still cared about being king, about his power and wealth.  She said that true freedom came from understanding the world and not being attached to it, whether you were a king or a beggar.  She explained this by using lots of examples, showing that everyone is connected, just like parts of the body work together.

Janaka listened carefully to Sulabha's long and wise explanation.  He realized she was right.  Sulabha explained that she had come to learn from him, not to trick him or show him up. She stayed only for the night, like a guest at his palace, then left the next day.

Bhishma finished the story, saying that even though Janaka was a great king, he learned even more from Sulabha.  Yudhishthira understood that true freedom comes from wisdom and understanding, not just from giving up everything.
