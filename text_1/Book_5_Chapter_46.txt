Long ago, a wise teacher named Sanat-sujata told a wonderful story about the universe.  He said it all started with a tiny seed, a magical seed called Mahayasas.

This seed was pure light and knowledge. It was so bright, it made the sun shine!  Only special people, called Yogins, could see this seed with their minds.

This amazing seed made everything grow. It gave the sun its heat and light.  It even created the earth and the sky!  Rivers, oceans, and the wind all came from this tiny seed.

Imagine our bodies like little cars, Sanat-sujata said.  These cars are going to break down someday. But the good things we do – those never disappear. They're like the strong wheels of the car, helping us get to a special place.

This special place is with the seed, the unchanging, wonderful seed.  It's a place nobody can truly see with their eyes, only with their hearts and minds.

The teacher explained that we live in a world of tricks and illusions, like a river.  We might see pretty things in the river, but it’s important to look beyond them.  This river also flows from the magical seed.

Everyone has a little piece of the seed inside them, he said. This is called Iswara. It's what makes us alive and helps us live good lives. Iswara created the world and told us how to live well.

But sometimes we get caught up in bad things and forget about the seed.  It’s like climbing a golden tree, but instead of reaching for the top we get stuck on the branches.  We need to climb back down and remember the seed.

The five elements – earth, water, fire, air, and space – all came from the seed.  Even the sun and the moon came from it.  Everything started from that one tiny seed!

Sanat-sujata said the seed is also inside us.  It’s like our breath, our thoughts, and our spirit.  It's hidden deep inside, like a swan swimming below the water.  If we find it, we’ll understand everything.

The seed is tiny, like a thumb, but it’s full of everything. It’s inside all of us, even inside people who don’t believe in it. But those who do, can feel happiness and peace.

The teacher said we should try to be kind, to control our thoughts and feelings, to forget about bad things. If we do, we can find the seed.   This magical seed is the beginning and the end of everything. It lives in everyone's heart. It's the father, the mother, the child, and the grandparent of everyone. It's always with us, but we might need to look carefully to find it.
