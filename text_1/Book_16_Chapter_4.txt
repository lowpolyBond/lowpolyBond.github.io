A terrible thing happened!  All the Yadava people, Krishna's family, were killed.  It was a curse, a very sad and powerful curse.

Krishna's friends, Daruka and Vabhru, found him sitting alone, very sad.  Krishna told Daruka to rush to Arjuna, a great warrior, and tell him about the terrible tragedy. He needed Arjuna's help.

Daruka sped away, heartbroken. Krishna then told Vabhru to protect the women and children. But poor Vabhru, still a little drunk from a party, was also killed!  Another victim of the curse.

Krishna went to his father, Vasudeva, in the city of Dwaraka. He asked his father to keep everyone safe until Arjuna arrived.  Then Krishna went to find his brother, Rama.  He said he was going to live quietly in the forest.

Rama was already doing special meditation.  Suddenly, a huge, beautiful, white snake came out of him! It was Rama's true form, a powerful snake god,  and he went back to the ocean, greeted by other snake gods and even the ocean king, Varuna!

Krishna's father, Vasudeva, was very, very sad. He knew what had to happen. He remembered old prophecies, about the curse and the end of the Yadavas.  He decided to leave the world too. He closed his eyes and did special meditation.

A hunter, Jara, was looking for deer. He saw Krishna sleeping in the forest. Mistaking Krishna for a deer, he accidentally shot him in the foot with an arrow.  Jara was horrified when he realized what heâ€™d done.

Krishna, even though he was hurt, comforted the hunter. Then, he shone with bright light, and went up to heaven!  All the gods and goddesses were there to greet him.  Everyone worshipped him and sang his praises.  Krishna, the great and kind god, had gone to his heavenly home.
