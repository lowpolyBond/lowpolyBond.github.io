King Dhritarashtra was very sad.  He was worried his son, Duryodhana, would lose the big battle. He fell to the ground, so upset he couldn't even think straight! His helpers splashed him with cool water and fanned him.  The queen and other ladies gently helped him back to his seat.  He was still shaky, but slowly he got better and wanted to know what had happened in the battle.

He asked, "My son's enemies are so strong!  Arjuna, the sun shining brightly, is like a fierce elephant charging into battle.  He's unstoppable! Who even tried to stop him from reaching Drona?"

Dhritarashtra kept asking about all the Pandava warriors. He wondered who tried to stop:

* **Bhima:**  Bhima was super strong, like ten thousand elephants! Who faced him as he charged towards Drona?

* **Arjuna:** Arjuna was like a storm cloud, shooting arrows like rain! His chariot rattled and roared.  He was as fast as lightning, a deadly warrior!  Did my soldiers even *try* to stop him?  Could anyone survive facing Arjuna?

* **Nakula:** Nakula was brave and handsome, and he fought bravely.  Who tried to stop *him*?

* **Sahadeva:** Sahadeva was fierce, like a poisonous snake!  Who fought against him?

* **Satyaki:**  Satyaki was a great warrior, just like Arjuna! Who stood against him?

* **Uttamaujas:**  Uttamaujas was a powerful warrior, as strong as the gods themselves! Who dared to fight him?

* **Dhrishtaketu:** Dhrishtaketu was brave and fought on the Pandavas' side. Who tried to stop him?

* **Ketumat:** Ketumat was very brave, he even killed one of Duryodhana's men! Who fought against him?

* **Sikhandin:** Sikhandin was a strong warrior who helped defeat Bhishma.  Who tried to stop *him*?

* **The Kekaya brothers:** Five brave brothers, fought alongside the Pandavas.  Who fought them?

* **Yuyutsu:** Yuyutsu was a super strong warrior. Even many kings couldn't defeat him! Who fought against him?

* **Dhrishtadyumna:** Dhrishtadyumna was wise and wanted Duryodhana to lose. Who tried to stop *him*?

* **Saivya:** Saivya was from a powerful family, known for their bravery and strength. Who stopped him?

* **Ghatotkacha:**  Ghatotkacha was a powerful demon warrior and Dhritarashtra was very scared of him!  Who tried to stop Ghatotkacha?

Dhritarashtra cried, "My army is no match for them!  The Pandavas have the greatest warriors on their side!  They have Krishna, the greatest of all, protecting them.  He is the Lord of the Universe, and they will win!"  He felt better after talking about it all.
