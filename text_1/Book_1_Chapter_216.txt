Arjuna, the strongest of the Pandavas, went to live in the forest.  Lots of people went with him: wise men who knew the holy books, musicians, holy people, and storytellers.  Arjuna traveled like a king with his guards! He saw beautiful forests, lakes, and rivers.  He decided to stay near the source of the Ganges River.

There, the wise men made many sacred fires.  They prayed and offered gifts to the gods.  The place became even more beautiful because of their prayers.

One day, Arjuna went into the Ganges River to bathe.  A beautiful Naga princess named Ulupi, who lived underwater, saw him.  She was so attracted to him that she pulled him down into her underwater palace!

Arjuna found a sacred fire in the palace. He offered prayers to the fire, just as he always did.  Then, he saw Ulupi and asked her, “Who are you? And where is this amazing place?”

Ulupi explained that she was the daughter of King Kauravya, the Naga king. She said she was so in love with him that she had to meet him.  She asked Arjuna to marry her.

Arjuna was surprised. He told Ulupi, "I promised to stay a holy man for twelve years. I can’t just marry anyone!”

Ulupi explained that Arjuna’s promise was because of a deal the Pandavas made about Draupadi, their shared wife.  She said that helping her wouldn’t break his promise.  She also said that it was a good thing to help someone in need.

Arjuna, being kind and understanding, agreed to spend some time with Ulupi.  He knew it wouldn't break his promise.

After spending the night with Ulupi, Arjuna returned to his camp.  Before she left, Ulupi gave Arjuna a magical gift: she made him invincible in the water!  Now, no creature of the water could ever hurt him.
