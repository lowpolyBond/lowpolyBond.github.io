Balarama, a strong and kind prince, visited a beautiful place called Kurukshetra.  After giving away lots of gifts, he went to a lovely forest.  This forest was full of amazing trees – mango trees, jackfruit trees, and many more!

Balarama asked some wise holy men who lived there about the forest. They told him a wonderful story.  A long, long time ago, a very holy woman lived there and prayed very hard. She was so good that she went to heaven!

Balarama spent the evening praying with the holy men. Then he started climbing a big mountain.  He saw a beautiful river and a special place for prayer. He bathed in the clean, clear water and stayed there for the night.  Then he went to another special place to pray.

While he was resting with some wise people, a very special holy man named Narada came to visit. Narada had magical golden things – a staff and a pot! He also had a beautiful musical instrument.

Narada told Balarama sad news about a big battle.  Many important people had died!  Only a few were left fighting.  Narada said Duryodhana, one of Balarama's students, was still fighting.  He was about to have a huge fight with Bhima, Balarama’s other student!

Balarama was very sad. He said goodbye to the holy men and rushed to see the battle. He loved the river Sarasvati very much. He sang a song about how wonderful and holy the river was.  Then he got in his fast chariot and went to the battlefield to watch his students fight.
