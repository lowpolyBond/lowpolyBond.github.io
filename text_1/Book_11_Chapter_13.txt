Once upon a time, after a big battle, some helpers bathed King Dhritarashtra.  Then, Krishna, a very wise man, talked to him.  Krishna said, "King, you're smart! You know the good books and the right things to do.  Why are you so angry? All this bad stuff happened because of your own mistakes!  Bhishma, Drona, Vidura, and Sanjaya all told you to be careful. They warned you that the Pandavas were stronger. You didn't listen.  A good king sees his mistakes and learns.  You let Duryodhana, your son, control you.  Your son did bad things, like making a princess feel very bad.  Bhima fought back because it was so unfair. The Pandavas are good, but you treated them very badly."

King Dhritarashtra listened. He said, "You're right, Krishna! My love for my children made me do wrong things. I'm lucky Bhima didn't hurt me.  I'm not angry anymore. I want to hug Bhima and the other Pandavas!" The old king was sad, but he hugged Bhima, Arjuna, and the other Pandava brothers. He cried and wished them well. He knew that after the war, they were his only hope for the future.
