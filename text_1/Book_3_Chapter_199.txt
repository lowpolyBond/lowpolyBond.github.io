Once upon a time, King Yudhishthira asked a wise man named Markandeya, "How can I go to heaven?  Is giving gifts the best way?  Does it matter when I give them – as a child, a young man, or an old man?"

Markandeya said, "There are four ways to waste your life.  One is having no children. Another is being bad.  A third is depending on others for food.  The last is cooking for yourself without sharing with the gods, your ancestors, and guests *before* you eat."

He then listed sixteen bad ways to give gifts:  giving to someone who doesn't follow rules, to a thief, to a bad teacher, to a liar, a sinner, an ungrateful person, someone who sells sacred books, a priest who cooks for someone of lower caste, a priest who doesn't do his job, someone who married a girl too young, women (in certain cases), a snake charmer, or a servant.  These gifts don't help you get to heaven.

Giving gifts out of fear or anger only helps you while you're still a baby in your mother's tummy!  Giving gifts when you are old will benefit you in old age.  The best way to get to heaven is to always give gifts to good priests.

Yudhishthira then asked, "How do priests help others get to heaven?"

Markandeya replied, "Priests pray, chant special words, make offerings to the gods, and study holy books.  This is like building a boat to take themselves and others to heaven.  Making priests happy pleases the gods, and they can even help you get to heaven!"

Markandeya explained that Yudhishthira should give gifts to good priests, especially at special ceremonies. He shouldn't give to bad priests or those who don't deserve it.  He also explained the value of hosting guests, offering them food, water, and a place to rest.  He said giving food was the best gift of all.

Yudhishthira then asked about the journey to the afterlife.  Markandeya said it's a very long and difficult journey, 86,000 yojanas (a long way!).  People who gave gifts to priests traveled more comfortably. Those who gave horses had horses to ride, those who gave umbrellas had shade from the sun, those who gave food weren’t hungry, and so on. Giving water was especially good; it created a refreshing river for them in the afterlife.

Yudhishthira kept asking about good deeds and how to be a good person. Markandeya talked about different types of purity (thoughts, actions, and cleanliness) and the importance of being kind and honest. He said true goodness comes from the heart, not just from outward acts like fasting or wearing special clothes.

Finally, Markandeya talked more about giving gifts.  He explained that gifts given at certain times and in certain ways are even more powerful. Giving a cow is exceptionally good, and the best gifts were given to those in need, such as the weary traveler asking for food.  Markandeya said that even helping the traveler find someone who *could* give food earned great merit.  The story ends with Markandeya explaining that giving gifts is one of the most important and powerful things a person can do.
