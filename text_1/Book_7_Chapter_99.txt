Once upon a time, during a big battle, Arjuna, the brave son of Kunti, was fighting so bravely! He fought so well that he made a wall of arrows around himself!  It was amazing!

Everyone watched in awe.  Even the magical beings cheered for him!  Arjuna fought on foot, but no one could stop him!  He didn't even get scared when lots of chariots, elephants, and horses charged at him.  He kept fighting and winning.  Kings threw tons of arrows, spears, and clubs at him, but it was like throwing rocks at the ocean!  Arjuna was unstoppable!

Then, his charioteer, Krishna, got out of their chariot.  The horses were hurt and tired from the battle.  Everyone gasped! No one had ever seen anything like it.  The Kauravas, the enemy army, were amazed.  They said, "This is the most amazing thing ever!  Even when they are not riding in their chariot, they are still winning!"

Krishna, who was very good with horses, took care of them. He took out the arrows, soothed their wounds, and gave them water.  Soon, the horses were ready to go again.

Krishna and Arjuna got back into their chariot.  The Kauravas were sad to see them go. They whispered, "Oh no! They're back, and they are going to beat us again!"

Arjuna, who was super fast, sped off towards Jayadratha, an enemy king.  Dust filled the air, making it hard to see.  The Kauravas were scared and said, "We have to stop them!  But it's no use, Duryodhana doesn't seem to know what to do."

Arjuna was like a lion hunting deer, going through the enemy lines, his conch shell horn sounding loud and clear. His chariot was so fast that the arrows he had shot earlier were left behind!  Lots of angry soldiers tried to stop him, but they couldn't!

Duryodhana, the leader of the Kauravas, tried to follow Arjuna, but it was almost impossible. The sun was setting, and the battlefield was covered in dust. The Kauravas were tired, hurt, and scared. They couldnâ€™t even see clearly anymore. The battle was far from over!
