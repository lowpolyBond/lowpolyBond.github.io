Once upon a time, Yudhishthira, a kind prince, was traveling. He came to some strange rivers and a spooky hill called Hemakuta.  It was a weird place!  If you spoke, rocks would fall! The wind howled, and it always rained.  Even though you could hear people reading holy books, you couldn't see anyone.  Strange, right?

Yudhishthira asked a wise man named Lomasa, "What's going on here?"

Lomasa explained, "Long ago, a very grumpy saint lived here. He was so angry that he cursed the hill! He said, 'If anyone talks, the hill will throw stones!' That's why it's so quiet and stormy."

He also told Yudhishthira about another mystery.  A long time ago, gods visited nearby rivers.  They didn't want people to see them, so they made the hill hard to climb, hiding their special place.  Only people who were very good and peaceful could see or climb it.  Lomasa told Yudhishthira to be quiet and to wash himself in the holy rivers to be cleansed.  He then directed the prince to another river, the Kausiki.


Lomasa then told Yudhishthira a story about a very holy man named Rishyasringa.  Rishyasringa was a special boy. He was born from a deer! His father was a very holy man who had wished for a son.  When the father was washing, some of his special fluid got into the water, which a deer then drank. From this, the deer gave birth to Rishyasringa. He was super holy, lived in the forest, and only his father had ever seen him.

Because of King Lomapada's bad deeds, the rain stopped in his kingdom.  Wise people told him that to bring the rain back, he needed Rishyasringa. But Rishyasringa didn't know anything about people. So the king sent some clever women to bring the holy boy to his kingdom.

That's how Rishyasringa came down from the mountains and brought the rain back!  The women cleverly lured him out with their beauty and kindness.  King Lomapada was very happy and gave Rishyasringa away in marriage to his daughter. And everyone had lots of rain again!
