Once upon a time, a mean ten-headed monster named Ravana wanted to kidnap Sita, Rama's beautiful wife.  He asked Maricha, a clever magical creature, for help.

Ravana explained his plan:  "Maricha, you must change into a golden deer!  Sita will want Rama to catch it.  While Rama's away, I'll snatch Sita!"

Maricha was scared.  Ravana threatened him, so Maricha agreed.  He knew it was dangerous, but he had no choice.

Maricha turned into a beautiful golden deer. He pranced near where Sita, Rama, and his brother Lakshmana were staying. Sita loved the deer and begged Rama to catch it.

Rama went after the deer, leaving Lakshmana to protect Sita.  Maricha tricked Rama, running far away.  Finally, Rama realized it was Maricha!  He shot an arrow, and Maricha fell, crying out in Rama's voice for help.

Sita heard Rama's voice and panicked.  She told Lakshmana to go help, but Lakshmana worried about leaving her alone.  Sita got angry and wouldn't listen.

While Sita was upset with Lakshmana, Ravana, disguised as a holy man, appeared. He revealed himself as the monster, Ravana. He tried to force Sita to come with him, but Sita refused. She said she would never leave Rama.

Ravana was furious. He grabbed Sita and flew away into the sky. A giant bird named Jatayu saw everything. He tried to stop Ravana, but the monster was too strong. Jatayu was badly hurt, but he'd done what he could to protect Sita.

Ravana flew away with Sita, leaving Rama and Lakshmana heartbroken and ready for a great adventure to rescue her!
