A wise, holy man spoke to Bhima, a strong Pandava prince.  "Bhima," he said, "I only asked you those questions because I care about you. I wasn't trying to scold you, or show off my knowledge, or get angry. I know how strong and brave you are! You’ll do even more for your family than you think. You, Bhima, and your friends, are exactly the kind of warriors your family deserves!

Some people worry about whether good things will happen or bad things. They wonder if they’re strong enough. But it’s tricky!  Sometimes what helps you succeed, can also make you fail.  It's like the wind – unpredictable. Even the best plans can be ruined. But even things that aren't our fault, like rain or hunger, can be overcome with hard work.  We can’t escape doing things, but we *can* choose which things to do. And remember, both our efforts and what's destined to happen work together.  So work hard, Bhima! Don't worry about winning or losing. Just do your best.  That’s what I meant."

The holy man continued, "Tomorrow I’ll talk to Dhritarashtra, the Kaurava king.  I’ll try to make peace, but I won’t let the Kauravas take advantage of you. If they make peace, everyone wins!  But if they refuse, there will be a terrible war.  Bhima, you and Arjuna will lead the Pandava army. I’ll be Arjuna’s chariot driver – he asked me to, and I want to help!"  He smiled. "I just wanted to remind you of your strength, my brave warrior!"
