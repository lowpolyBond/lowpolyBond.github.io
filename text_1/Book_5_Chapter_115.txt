King Yayati was a very generous king.  One day, a wise man named Galava and a powerful bird named Garuda came to him asking for a gift.  Garuda explained that Galava needed a very special gift to help him.

Yayati wanted to help. He really wanted to! But he wasn't as rich as he used to be.  He thought hard.  He knew that if he said he couldn't help, it would be bad luck.  It was said that refusing someone in need could bring bad luck to the whole kingdom!

Yayati had a beautiful daughter named Madhavi.  She was so beautiful that even gods wanted to marry her!  Yayati decided to give Madhavi to Galava.  He said, “Madhavi will bring good luck to her husband!  She is a wonderful gift!”

Galava was very happy.  He thanked King Yayati and flew away with Madhavi and Garuda. Garuda said, "Now we can get the horses we need!"

Galava decided to find a king who would give him lots of horses as a wedding gift for Madhavi. He heard of King Haryyaswa, a very good king who lived in Ayodhya.  King Haryyaswa was kind and loved wise men.  He also really wanted a child.

Galava went to see King Haryyaswa. He said, "King, Madhavi is a wonderful woman, and she will bring you many children. Will you marry her and give me horses as a wedding gift?"  Galava then told the King how many horses he wanted.
