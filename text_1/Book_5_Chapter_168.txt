King Dhritarashtra was worried about the upcoming war.  His uncle, Sakuni, was a clever strategist, ready to fight hard.  He had a powerful army, fast as the wind!

Then there was Aswatthaman, Drona's son. He was a super-strong warrior, even better than Arjuna, who was famous for his bow and arrow Gandiva. Aswatthaman’s arrows flew so fast, they almost touched each other!  He was incredibly powerful, but he was also very afraid of dying.

Drona, Aswatthaman's father, was old but still super strong!  He was like a fire, burning up the enemy army.  He loved Arjuna, his student, more than his own son.  He wouldn't want to hurt Arjuna.

Another great warrior was Karna’s son, Vrishasena.  He was a brave warrior who would fight hard for the Kauravas.

Vrihadvala was another powerful warrior.  He was like death itself on the battlefield.  His army was strong and ready to fight.

Jalasandha was very strong, a fearless fighter, ready to die for the Kauravas. He fought from his chariot or even from an elephant!

Vahlika was brave and fearless, just like Yama, the god of death. He never ran away from a battle.

Satyavan was another great warrior. He never gave up and always fought bravely.

Alambusha, a powerful Rakshasa (demon), was also on their side.  He hated the Pandavas and would fight them fiercely.

Bhagadatta, the king of Pragjyotisha, was a great warrior. He fought Arjuna for many days!  But then he became friends with Arjuna.  He fought from a huge elephant, just like Indra, the king of the gods, fought from his elephant Airavata.

Bhishma told King Dhritarashtra about all these strong warriors on his side, explaining how powerful they would be in the battle.
