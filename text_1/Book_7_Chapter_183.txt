The King Dhritarashtra was worried. He asked Sanjaya, his advisor,  "Why didn't Karna use his super-powerful spear to kill Arjuna or Krishna? That spear could kill anyone, even the gods!"

Sanjaya explained, "Every night, we told Karna to use the spear on Arjuna or Krishna the next morning. But, every morning, they forgot! It seems like fate decided things.  Karna had the spear, but destiny kept him from using it."

Dhritarashtra sighed, "Fate, bad choices, and Krishna himself have destroyed us! That powerful spear was wasted on Ghatotkacha, a small warrior. Karna and my sons are all dead now. Tell me what happened after Ghatotkacha died."

Sanjaya continued the story.  "After Ghatotkacha died, the Kauravas cheered. They attacked the Pandavas hard. King Yudhishthira was very sad. He was heartbroken that Ghatotkacha, a good friend who helped them a lot, was gone.  He felt hopeless.

Krishna, seeing Yudhishthira's sadness, told him, "Don't be sad!  Fight! We need you!"

Yudhishthira explained, "Ghatotkacha was like a brother to me. He helped us so much, even carrying Princess Draupadi on his back. I'm very upset that he's gone."

He was especially angry that Karna killed Ghatotkacha.  He remembered how Karna and Drona had tricked Abhimanyu to death too. Yudhishthira felt a burning need to avenge his friend and fight Karna.

Then, a wise man, Vyasa, appeared. He said, "Arjuna is still alive. It's lucky they didn't fight one-on-one, because if they had, Karna would have used the magic spear on Arjuna.  Ghatotkacha's death was a sad thing, but it might have been meant to be. Don't let sadness take over. Fight bravely!  You will win!"

So, Yudhishthira,  feeling stronger, led his army against Karna, ready to fight.  He was determined to avenge Ghatotkacha.  The battle raged on!
