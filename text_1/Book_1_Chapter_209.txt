Once upon a time, after a big wedding, wise Vidura told King Drupada it was time for the Pandava brothers – Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, and the twins – to go home.  King Drupada agreed. He said the Pandavas, along with Krishna and Vidura, should decide when to leave.

Yudhishthira said, "We'll do whatever you say, King Drupada!"

Krishna said, "I think it's a good idea for the Pandavas to go home. But let's follow King Drupada's plan."

King Drupada smiled. "I agree with Krishna.  The Pandavas are like family to me and to Krishna."

So, the Pandavas, Krishna, Vidura, and Draupadi (Drupada's daughter) and Kunti, their mother, started their journey home. They had fun along the way!

When the Pandavas were close to their home city, Hastinapura, King Dhritarashtra sent some important people – Vikarna, Chitrasena, Drona, and Kripa – to welcome them.  Everyone was so happy to see the Pandavas!  People cheered, "The Pandavas are back!  Our heroes are home!"  Others said, "It’s like King Pandu himself has returned from the forest!"

The Pandavas went to see their grandfather, Dhritarashtra, and their great-uncle, Bhishma. They greeted everyone nicely.  Dhritarashtra then told Yudhishthira, "You and your brothers should live in Khandavaprastha. It’s half the kingdom, and you’ll be safe there."

The Pandavas happily agreed. They went to Khandavaprastha, which was a wild, empty place.  But with hard work and Krishna’s help, they built a magnificent city!

They made it beautiful. They built high walls, big gates, and strong towers. They had lots of gardens with amazing trees like mango trees, palm trees, and many more. There were pretty lakes, lovely flowers, and singing birds everywhere. The city was so wonderful, they called it Indraprastha, like the city of the gods!

Soon, many people moved to Indraprastha – wise teachers, clever traders, and skilled workers.  Everyone was happy there.

After the city was built, Krishna and his friend Rama went back to their own city, Dwaravati.  The Pandavas were safe and happy in their new home, all thanks to the kindness of Dhritarashtra and Bhishma.
