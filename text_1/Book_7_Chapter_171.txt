Sanjaya told the king, "Many brave kings attacked Satyaki.  They rode in shiny chariots, with lots of soldiers and elephants. They roared like lions, wanting to defeat him.  Satyaki was strong! He fought back, shooting many arrows.  He cut down many heads, broke many elephant trunks, and smashed warrior's arms!  The battlefield was filled with broken things—like a night sky full of stars.  The sounds of people crying were awful, like ghosts screaming.

The king's son heard all the noise. He told his driver, "Go there! Let's see what's happening!" Duryodhana, the king's son, attacked Satyaki. Satyaki shot many arrows at Duryodhana, but Duryodhana fought back.  Then Satyaki shot even more arrows at Duryodhana, and even knocked his horses down! Duryodhana had to jump into another chariot. Satyaki was winning the fight! He defeated the king's army.


Meanwhile, many warriors attacked Arjuna. They used magic weapons, but Arjuna was very brave. He fought them all off.  Sakuni, a very angry warrior, shot many arrows at Arjuna, but Arjuna fought back and shot many arrows at Sakuni, and even knocked his horses down too.  The ground was covered with broken arrows and dead warriors – it looked like a field of flowers. Arjuna also defeated Sakuni and his son. Their army ran away, scared.  Arjuna and Krishna blew their horns to celebrate their victory!


Dhrishtadyumna fought against Drona. He broke Drona’s bow, but Drona got a new one and shot back.  Dhrishtadyumna kept fighting and defeated many soldiers. The battlefield was covered in blood – it looked like a scary river!  Dhrishtadyumna and his friends were victorious, even against Duryodhana, Karna, and Drona’s army! They defeated thousands of warriors!"
