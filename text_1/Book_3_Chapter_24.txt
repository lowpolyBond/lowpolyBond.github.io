The Pandava brothers had to leave their home.  Yudhishthira, the eldest, was very wise and kind. He said, "Brothers, we must live in the forest for twelve years.  Let's find a beautiful, safe place with lots of birds, animals, and yummy fruits!"

Arjuna, the best archer, said, "Brother, you know the best places! You've talked to many wise people.  I know a great lake called Dwaitavana. It's full of pretty flowers and birds.  We could live there!"

Yudhishthira agreed, "That sounds perfect, Arjuna! Let's go to Dwaitavana."

So they went to Dwaitavana.  It was a wonderful forest!  Many wise men lived there. Some prayed to the gods, some studied, and some were very old and holy.  The forest was full of amazing trees â€“ mango trees, palm trees, and many more!  Beautiful birds sang songs.  Big elephants walked through the forest.  Lots of holy people lived there too, some wearing simple clothes made of tree bark.

When the Pandavas arrived, many people came to greet them.  Everyone was happy to see the kind king. Yudhishthira sat under a big, beautiful tree, just like his father used to do.  His brothers, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva, and their friend Krishna, sat with him.  They were all tired from their journey, but happy to be in their new forest home. The big tree with the brothers sitting under it looked like a mountain with five huge elephants resting on its side!
