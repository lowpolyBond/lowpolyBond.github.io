Arjuna and Krishna were fighting a big battle.  Arjuna saw that his friends were in trouble.  A mean guy named Susarman and his brothers wanted to fight Arjuna.

Arjuna asked Krishna, "Should I help my friends first, or fight Susarman and his brothers?"  Krishna turned the chariot towards Susarman.

Arjuna was super-strong! He shot seven arrows at Susarman.  He broke Susarman's bow and flag.  Then he quickly shot six more arrows and defeated Susarman's brothers.

Susarman threw a sharp iron spear at Arjuna, and another at Krishna. But Arjuna was too fast! He sliced both spears in half with his arrows.  Then he shot so many arrows at Susarman that Susarman couldn't fight anymore.

Arjuna kept fighting, like a fire burning through a field of straw.  No one could stop him!  He was so strong and brave, he defeated lots of enemy soldiers.

Then, Arjuna found another strong enemy, King Bhagadatta, who was riding a huge elephant.  Bhagadatta threw lots of arrows at Arjuna and Krishna. Arjuna cleverly avoided them and shot back!

The battle between Arjuna and Bhagadatta was amazing! They fought bravely, back and forth. Bhagadattaâ€™s elephant trampled many soldiers and chariots.

Arjuna could have easily killed Bhagadatta and his elephant but he wanted a fair fight. Arjuna was very angry when the elephant continued to destroy everything.  The battle continued!
