Arjuna was in exile.  He went on a long journey.  He visited many holy places. He gave lots of cows to the wise priests who traveled with him.

He went to snowy mountains and beautiful rivers.  He saw the river Utpalini, full of pretty lotus flowers!  He saw the Ganga River too! He cleaned himself in all the holy waters and gave more cows away.

Arjuna traveled to many different kingdoms.  In Kalinga, the priests said goodbye. Arjuna continued alone, except for a few friends.

He saw tall mountains and beautiful homes.  He reached Manipura, a city by the sea. There, he met a beautiful princess named Chitrangada.  Her father, King Chitravahana, was very kind.

The king explained a special rule:  his family always had only one child. His ancestors had sons, but he had only a daughter.  He treated Chitrangada like a son.

The king told Arjuna, "If you marry my daughter, your son will continue my family line.  This is my way of giving her away."

Arjuna agreed. He married Chitrangada and lived in Manipura for three years.  They had a son! Then Arjuna said goodbye and continued his journey.
