King Dhritarashtra asked, "Sanjaya, tell me! How did Bhima, the mighty warrior, fight the King of Kalinga and his army?"

Sanjaya replied, "The King of Kalinga, urged on by your son, attacked Bhima with a huge army of soldiers, horses, and elephants.  Bhima, helped by his friends the Chedis, fought back bravely!  The Kalinga army was very big, and they also had Ketumat and Srutayus fighting with them.  The Kalingas, Nishadas, and Bhima's friends fought a huge, scary battle! It was like Indra (the king of the gods) fighting the demons!"

The battlefield was noisy and messy, like a stormy ocean!  Soldiers fought so hard they sometimes hurt their own friends by mistake.  Bhima's friends, the Chedis, got scared and ran away. But Bhima didn't! He shot many arrows from his chariot. The King of Kalinga and his son, Sakradeva, shot back. They even shot Bhima's horses!

Bhima's horses fell, but he kept fighting!  He threw a big iron mace at Sakradeva, and Sakradeva fell down dead!  Then, the King of Kalinga attacked Bhima with more soldiers. Bhima switched to a sword and fought even harder! He even cut a poisonous arrow sent by the King in half! The King threw fourteen spears, but Bhima cut them all up before they could hit him.  He then fought Bhanumat, another Kalinga warrior, on a big elephant. Bhima jumped onto the elephant and killed Bhanumat with his sword, then chopped off the elephant's head!

Bhima fought like a whirlwind, killing many soldiers, horses, and elephants. He was so strong, he looked like Death himself!  He jumped and spun, cutting and slashing. The battlefield was full of broken weapons, dead elephants, and fallen soldiers.  The King of Kalinga and many of his soldiers were killed.

The Kalingas were scared and ran away, but then they came back.  Dhrishtadyumna, Bhima’s friend, shouted, "Fight!"  More of Bhima's friends joined the fight.  King Yudhishthira also helped.  Bhima’s friends, Dhrishtadyumna and Satyaki, helped him fight.  They fought bravely together.

Even Bhishma, a great warrior from Dhritarashtra's side, came to fight Bhima. Bhishma and the Pandava warriors shot many arrows at each other.  Satyaki even killed Bhishma's charioteer.  Bhishma had to leave the battle because his chariot was damaged.

Bhima was unstoppable.  He defeated the whole Kalinga army. His friends Satyaki and Dhrishtadyumna praised him for his bravery.  The battle was over, and Bhima had won!
