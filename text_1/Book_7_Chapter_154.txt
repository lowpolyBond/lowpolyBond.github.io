One night, during the big war, a very strong warrior named Drona got really angry.  He was so strong, he almost defeated all the Pandavas!  They were scared, like skinny cows shivering in the cold.  Dhritarashtra, the blind king, wanted to know what happened.  He asked his advisor, Sanjaya.

Sanjaya said, "King, it was a terrible night! Drona was unstoppable! He killed many warriors with his arrows.  Then, a brave king named Sivi fought Drona.  Sivi shot many arrows, even killing Drona's chariot driver! But Drona was too strong. He killed Sivi too.

Then, Bhima, the strongest Pandava, had a fight with a Kalinga king. The Kalinga king hurt Bhima with his arrows.  But Bhima was furious!  He jumped onto the Kalinga kingâ€™s chariot and punched him to death!  Bhima's power was amazing; he broke the dead king's bones with his bare hands!

Other warriors attacked Bhima, but he was too strong. He even killed Dhruva with a punch! He grabbed another warrior, Jayarata, and slapped him to death!  Karna, a great warrior, tried to fight Bhima, but Bhima grabbed Karna's spear and threw it back at him!

Bhima then fought King Durmada and his brother Dushkarna. They fought bravely, shooting many arrows at Bhima. But Bhima was so strong, he made their chariot sink into the ground with one stomp of his foot! Then he punched them both until they fell down!

Everyone was terrified of Bhima!  The other kings ran away, scared. That night, Bhima fought so bravely that everyone thought he was the god Rudra!  After the battle, the Pandavas were happy, and they all praised Bhima for being so strong.  But then, the Kaurava army, including Duryodhana and Drona, surrounded Bhima.  Another big fight started in the dark. It was a terrible, noisy battle, just what wolves and crows like!"
