A great battle raged!  Sanjaya told King Dhritarashtra all about it.  Thousands and thousands of soldiers fought.  It was so chaotic that sons didn't know their fathers, brothers didn't know brothers, and friends fought friends!  It was like demons had taken over!

Crash! Bang!  Chariots smashed into each other.  Big elephants fought, their tusks tearing each other.  They trumpeted loudly in pain.  Some elephants were hurt, but kept fighting!

Soldiers on foot fought with swords, spears, and axes.  They were brave and angry.  Their swords flashed in the sunlight, all bloody.  The battlefield was full of cries and screams.  People called out for their fathers, mothers, brothers, and friends.  Many soldiers were hurt and bleeding.  Some asked for water.  Others, too injured to fight, just lay there.  

Some brave warriors, even when badly hurt, didn't cry out. They just fought harder!  Some brave soldiers got hurt, but looked beautiful, like flowers!  It was a terrible battle.  Fathers killed sons, and sons killed fathers. Friends became enemies.  Everyone fought fiercely, not caring who they hurt.

Even the mighty Bhishma, on his silver chariot, looked like the moon shining on a mountain! The battle was so fierce that even the Pandavas' army started to get scared.
