Once, while the monkey army was resting, sneaky demons came!  These demons, led by Ravana, were invisible.  But Vibhishana, a wise demon who helped Rama, broke their magic trick!  The monkeys saw the demons and quickly defeated them.

Ravana was furious! He marched his army to fight.  He was a great warrior, just like a super-smart general. Rama, Lakshmana, and the monkeys got ready to fight back.  Rama and Ravana fought each other. Lakshmana fought Indrajit, another strong demon.  Sugriva fought Virupakshya, and other monkey heroes fought other demons.

It was a HUGE battle!  Arrows flew everywhere! Swords clashed!  It was like a fight between the gods and giants long ago!  Ravana threw spears and swords at Rama. Rama threw sharp arrows back.  Lakshmana and Indrajit also fought fiercely.  Vibhishana and Prahasta rained arrows on each other!  The whole battle was so scary, even the gods were worried!
