King Dhritarashtra was worried.  His son Duryodhana had done something terrible. Sanjaya, his charioteer, told him what happened.

Duryodhana and his friends had been very mean to Draupadi, the Pandavas' wife.  They dragged her into the assembly! They said cruel things.  Arjuna, one of the Pandavas, was very angry.  He's so strong, he even fought a god disguised as a hunter!  This god, Shiva, was testing Arjuna's strength.  Arjuna won!  He's incredibly powerful.  Even the gods couldn't beat him!

Bhima, another Pandava brother, was furious. He said he would hurt Duryodhana badly for what he did to Draupadi.  All the Pandavas were incredibly strong and skilled fighters.  They were so angry, they would surely fight back.

King Dhritarashtra was scared.  He knew his sons had been wrong. He said, "My sons are wicked!  They don’t listen to me.  Karna and his friends are bad influences, too. They only want to do what's wrong.”

Dhritarashtra knew Arjuna was incredibly powerful, even more so now because he was so angry.  Arjuna’s arrows were like magic!  They could even hurt gods!  And Arjuna has Krishna, a powerful god, as his friend and protector.  The king worried that his sons couldn’t possibly win against the angry Pandavas.  The Pandavas were too strong, too skilled, and too angry to be defeated. The king knew his sons were in great danger.
