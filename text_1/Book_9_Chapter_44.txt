Once upon a time, a very special baby was born!  His name was Kartikeya, and he was super strong and amazing.  His story begins with a magical seed from a powerful god named Shiva. This seed was so strong, even fire couldn't burn it!  It landed in a river, then on a mountain, where the baby Kartikeya grew.

Six kind goddesses, the Krittikas, found him.  They all wanted him to be their son, so Kartikeya magically grew six mouths so he could nurse from them all!  Because of him, the mountain turned to gold!  Everyone loved Kartikeya.  He was so strong and good.  He even learned to use all kinds of weapons!

One day, Kartikeya saw lots of strange creatures.  They were spooky and had animal faces â€“ like tigers, lions, even owls!  Lots of important gods and goddesses were there too!  They all wondered who Kartikeya would choose as his favorite.  To surprise them, he used magic to make himself into four amazing boys!

Each boy went to a different god or goddess, showing them equal love. Everyone was amazed! The gods and goddesses asked the Great God Brahma to give Kartikeya an important job. Brahma thought hard. Then, he made Kartikeya the leader of all the gods' armies!  He would be their best warrior!

They all went to a beautiful river, the Sarasvati, to celebrate.  It was a happy day, full of music and dancing, as everyone welcomed their new brave leader! Kartikeya was ready to fight the bad guys and protect everyone. And that's the story of how Kartikeya became a great hero!
