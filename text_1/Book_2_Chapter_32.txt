Rama, a kind prince, was going to live in the forest.  He sent his brother, Lakshmana, to invite a wise holy man, Rishi Suyajna, to say goodbye.

Lakshmana found the holy man and brought him to Rama's beautiful palace. Rama and his wife, Sita, were very happy to see him.  They gave Rishi Suyajna lots of wonderful gifts:  shiny jewelry, necklaces, a comfy bed, and even a big elephant!

Then Rama gave lots of gifts to his friends and helpers. He gave them cows, gold, silver, and beautiful clothes.  He gave extra special gifts to the people who helped his mom. He wanted everyone to be happy.  Rama’s friends and helpers were sad because Rama was leaving.

Rama gave all his servants lots of money so they’d be okay while he was gone. Then he gave lots of gold and silver to old people, sick people, and anyone who needed help.

A poor man named Trijata, who worked very hard in the forest, heard about Rama's kindness. His wife told him to ask Rama for help. Trijata, wearing old, ragged clothes, went to see Rama.

Trijata told Rama he was very poor and had a big family. Rama smiled and said, “Throw your stick, and I’ll give you as many cows as can fit between you and where the stick lands!”

Trijata threw his stick as hard as he could! It landed near a field of thousands of cows!  Rama gave all those cows to Trijata! Trijata was so happy and thankful!

Rama gave away all his remaining riches to everyone he could:  his friends, his servants, and all the poor people.  He wanted to make sure everyone was taken care of before he left for the forest.
