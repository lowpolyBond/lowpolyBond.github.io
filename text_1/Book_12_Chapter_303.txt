Once upon a time, the brave Yudhishthira asked his wise uncle Bhishma, "Uncle, what is something that never goes away, and once you have it, you never have to come back here again? And what is something that does go away, so you have to come back?"

Bhishma smiled. "Yudhishthira, I'll tell you a story.  A long time ago, King Janaka asked the great sage Vasishtha the same question!"

Bhishma explained Vasishtha's answer: "Imagine the universe as a giant house.  This house is built and rebuilt over and over again.  It takes a really, really long time—12,000 years for one little part, and then many, many more years after that!  This long time is called a Kalpa, which is like one day and night for the great god Brahman.

When Brahman's night comes, everything seems to disappear. But then a powerful god, Isana, wakes up and builds a new universe.  He's like a super-powerful builder! He creates Hiranyagarbha, the first being, who is super smart and creates everything else.

He creates consciousness (our ability to think and feel), and then all the elements: air, light, space, water, and earth.  Then, using these elements, he makes all the creatures of the world –  people, animals, insects, even plants.  This is the world we see, the world that changes and ends. This is the 'destructible' thing.

But there's also something that *never* changes, something that is always there.  It's the 'indestructible' part. It's like the energy that makes everything possible.  Think of it as the invisible force that makes the house, then rebuilds it again and again."

Bhishma continued, "This universe, the house that we see, is made of things that change and disappear. That's the destructible part. But there's a 25th thing, Vishnu, which is formless, and it is part of the indestructible.   This indestructible part is always there, even when the universe is gone. It’s like the plan for the house that never goes away. It is part of everything, and everything comes back to it."

Bhishma then explained that we are all part of this cycle of building and rebuilding. Our actions determine whether we go to a happy place or a sad place after we die and our life in this universe ends.  Good actions lead to happiness, and bad actions lead to unhappiness.  But ultimately, everything comes back to the indestructible, the ever-lasting part.

Yudhishthira listened, his curiosity finally satisfied, understanding the cycle of life, death, and rebirth. He finally understood the difference between what disappears and what always remains.
