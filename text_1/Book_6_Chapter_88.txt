Once upon a time, after a good night's sleep, the Kauravas and Pandavas got ready for a HUGE battle!  The noise was so loud, it sounded like the roaring ocean!

King Duryodhana and his friends – Bhishma, Drona, and many others – lined up their army.  They wore shiny armor and were ready to fight!  Bhishma led the way, followed by Drona, then Bhagadatta, and many more brave kings with their soldiers. Their army was enormous, like a giant ocean wave!

Yudhishthira, the Pandava king, saw the huge Kaurava army. He told his army leader,  "Look at that army! It's huge!  Let's get ready to fight back!"

The Pandava army got ready too.  Bhima and Satyaki were at the front, followed by Arjuna, with his friend Krishna driving his chariot. Yudhishthira was in the middle, with his brothers.  Abhimanyu and other brave heroes were at the back.  Their army was ready too!

The noise was incredible! Drums banged, horns blew, and everyone shouted and cheered.  The armies stared at each other, ready to fight!

Then the battle began! Arrows flew like angry snakes, spears shone like lightning, and maces crashed to the ground.  The clash of swords and shields sounded loud and clear!  It was a big, noisy, exciting battle!  Elephants crashed into each other, soldiers fought on foot and on elephants. It looked like gods and demons fighting in the sky!

Then Bhishma, a very powerful warrior, charged into the Pandavas' army!  Dhrishtadyumna and the other Pandava warriors charged right back!  Foot soldiers, chariot warriors, and elephants crashed together. It was a massive, exciting battle with everyone fighting hard!
