Once upon a time, in a great battle, Bhima and Karna fought.  Karna's chariot was broken, but he hopped into a new one!  They fought like two giant elephants, crashing into each other with their spears.  Karna hit Bhima hard, but Bhima shot him back with even more arrows!

Karna then hit Bhima’s chariot flag. Bhima was angry! He shot so many arrows at Karna, it was like a whip against a horse! Karna’s mouth was dry, and his eyes were red with anger. He threw a super strong arrow, like a thunderbolt! It hit the ground with a thud!

Bhima, super angry, threw a huge, golden mace! It smashed Karna’s horses. Then Bhima chopped off Karna's flag and killed his driver! Karna was all alone, without a chariot, but he kept fighting!

Duryodhana, Karna’s friend, saw this. He told his brother, Durmukha, “Give Karna a new chariot!” Durmukha rushed to help, but Bhima was happy to see this! He shot many arrows and killed Durmukha.

Karna jumped into Durmukha's chariot. He was sad because Durmukha was dead.  Then Bhima shot even more arrows at Karna! They pierced Karna's armor, like angry snakes!  Karna shot back, hitting Bhima’s arm.  Bhima was bleeding! He shot back again, hurting Karna even more!

Finally, Karna was too tired. He ran away! Bhima, strong and brave, stayed to fight! He was like a blazing fire!
