Once upon a time, during a big battle in the Mahabharata,  Sanjaya told King Dhritarashtra what was happening.

"King," Sanjaya said, "your son, Chitrasena, was fighting Nakula's son, Satanika.  Satanika was shooting lots of arrows! Chitrasena fought back bravely.  They shot arrows back and forth at each other.  Satanika was very strong and knocked off Chitrasena's armor!  Without his armor, Chitrasena looked like a snake shedding its skin – beautiful and shiny!  Then Satanika broke Chitrasena's bow and flag.  But Chitrasena grabbed a new bow and shot back!  Satanika, angry now, killed Chitrasena's horses and driver.  Chitrasena jumped off his chariot and shot twenty-five arrows at Satanika!  Satanika, in return, cut off Chitrasena’s fancy bow with a special arrow.  Chitrasena, without his chariot, horses, bow, or driver, hopped onto another chariot and kept fighting!"


Next, Sanjaya told about another fight.  "King, Vrishasena, Karna's son, was fighting Drupada.  Yajnasena also joined the fight and shot lots of arrows at Vrishasena.  Vrishasena fought back with even more arrows! They were covered in arrows, looking like spiky porcupines!  They were so covered in blood, they looked like beautiful flowering trees! Vrishasena shot many arrows at Drupada. Drupada broke Vrishasena’s bow. Vrishasena got a new bow and shot Drupada.  Drupada fainted and was taken away. The Kaurava army attacked Drupada’s soldiers.  The battlefield was lit by lamps, and looked beautiful like a starry night. Vrishasena won the fight and looked like the sun in the sky!"


Finally, Sanjaya talked about another battle. "Your son Duhsasana fought Prativindhya.  Their fight was amazing, like two bright stars in the night sky! Duhsasana hit Prativindhya on the forehead with arrows, making him look like a mountain. Prativindhya fought back, shooting lots of arrows at Duhsasana!  Duhsasana was very strong. He killed Prativindhya's horses, driver, and even smashed his chariot to pieces! Prativindhya, with no chariot, kept fighting. Duhsasana broke Prativindhya’s bow.  Prativindhya's brothers came to help. A huge fight started, and many soldiers died that night."
