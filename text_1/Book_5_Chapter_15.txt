Once upon a time, the powerful king Nahusha was stronger than Indra, the king of the gods!  Indra's wife, Sachi, was worried.  She went to Indra for help.

Indra said, "I can't fight him now. Nahusha is too strong.  Sachi, you must trick him. Go to Nahusha secretly and tell him, 'I want you to ride in a special palanquin carried by wise holy men.  If you do that, I will be yours!'"

Sachi did as Indra said.  She went to Nahusha, who was very happy to see her. He agreed to anything she wanted.

Sachi said, "I want you to have a special ride – a palanquin carried by holy men. Nobody has ever had such a special ride before!"

Nahusha loved this idea. He was so proud! He had the holy men carry him everywhere.

But Sachi had a plan. She rushed to Vrihaspati, a very wise teacher, and asked for help.

Vrihaspati said, "Don't worry! Nahusha is being too proud and arrogant. He's using the holy men, which is wrong. I will perform a special magic to find Indra."

Vrihaspati started a magical fire. He asked the fire to find Indra. The fire, who is also a god, changed into a woman and searched everywhere – mountains, forests, the sky!

The fire couldn't find Indra anywhere except the water.  But the fire is afraid of water!  Vrihaspati told the fire to go into the water anyway.

The fire said, "I can't! I'll be destroyed!"  This shows us that even the strongest things have weaknesses. Then the story showed how everything comes from something else,  like how fire comes from water.  And that's how Indra was saved!
