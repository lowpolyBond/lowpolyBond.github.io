Once upon a time, during a big battle, Krishna (also known as Vasudeva) talked to Karna.  Krishna said, "Karna, you're suddenly talking about being good! But where was your goodness before?  You and your friends were mean to Draupadi. You let them treat her badly. You didn't stop Shakuni from cheating in the game and taking everything from the Pandavas. You didn't help the Pandavas when they were in trouble. You even tried to burn them alive! You laughed when Draupadi was sad and hurt. You didn't stop anyone from being mean to her. You even tricked the Pandavas into another game! You let Abhimanyu die in battle.  Your goodness only shows up now, when it's too late!"

Krishna continued, "Your bad actions will catch up with you, Karna. But the Pandavas, who are good and brave, will win. They will get their kingdom back, with the help of their friends.  The Kauravas will lose."

Karna felt ashamed but he kept fighting.  Krishna told Arjuna, "Arjuna, defeat Karna!"  Arjuna was very angry, remembering all the bad things Karna had done.  He and Karna fought fiercely, using powerful magic arrows.  They shot arrows at each other, making the sky dark and the ground shake!

Karna shot a powerful arrow that hit Arjuna. Arjuna fell.  But quickly, he got back up!  Then, to weaken Karna, Arjuna cut down Karna's beautiful flag on his chariot with another amazing arrow.  Seeing their flag fall, Karna's soldiers became scared.

Arjuna then shot a super powerful arrow.  It was so strong, it cut off Karna's head!  Karna died.  A bright light shone from his body.

The Pandavas cheered!  They blew their horns, happy that Karna was defeated.  The Kauravas were scared and ran away.  Karna's death marked a big turning point in the battle. The sun seemed to set on Karna, just like the real sun sets at the end of the day.
