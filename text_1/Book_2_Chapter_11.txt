Once upon a time, Queen Kaikeyi loved King Dasaratha very much.  One night, she asked him for a big favor.  She said, "I want something very special. If you promise to give it to me, I’ll tell you what it is."

King Dasaratha was very much in love with Kaikeyi, so he immediately said, "My dearest queen, I promise!  I swear by my amazing son, Rama, that I will do anything you ask!"

Kaikeyi had been talking to a wicked woman named Manthara. Manthara wanted Kaikeyi's son, Bharata, to be king.  So, Kaikeyi remembered a promise King Dasaratha had made a long time ago. He had promised her two special wishes.

Kaikeyi reminded the king of his promise.  She said, "Remember, long ago you promised me two wishes!  The whole world heard you promise!"  She told him that she had saved his life once, and this was her reward.

Kaikeyi was clever. She knew the king loved her and would do anything she asked.  She asked for two things.  First, she wanted her son Bharata to become the next king instead of Rama. Second, she wanted Rama to be sent away to live in the forest for fourteen years!

The king was shocked. He loved Rama very much. But he had given his promise.  Sadly, he had to agree to Kaikeyi’s wishes.  Rama, the best prince, was sent away to live in the forest, and Bharata became king.  It was a very sad day for everyone.
