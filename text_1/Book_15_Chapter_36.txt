After the great war, Dhritarashtra, the blind king, saw his sons and grandsons again.  It was like magic!  He wasn't sad anymore. He felt happy.  Everyone went back to their homes.

The Pandavas – Yudhishthira and his brothers – went to visit Dhritarashtra.  Their grandfather, Vyasa, a very wise man, talked to Dhritarashtra.  Vyasa said, “Dhritarashtra, your children are happy now. You've heard great stories and learned so much. Don't be sad anymore.  Yudhishthira is waiting for your permission to go home and rule the kingdom.  It’s been a long time, and the kingdom needs a king.”

Dhritarashtra was happy to see his family. He loved Yudhishthira very much, but he told him, “My dear son, you’ve been so good to me.  Go back to your kingdom.  I want to be alone to pray and think.  Your mother Kunti and my wife Gandhari want to pray too.”

Yudhishthira didn't want to leave.  He loved his grandfather and his mothers. But Gandhari said, "Son, the kingdom needs you. Go, and rule wisely."

Yudhishthira was very sad. He missed everyone.  He explained that many people had died, and the kingdom needed him.  But his mother Kunti said, “My son, go. Our prayers will be better if you’re not here.  Go and be happy.”

Sahadeva, one of Yudhishthira’s brothers, also wanted to stay.  But his mother convinced him to go.

Finally, Yudhishthira and his brothers said goodbye. They hugged their grandfather and mothers. They promised to always remember them.

Then, with their wives and friends, they started their journey back to their kingdom, Hastinapura. The sound of chariot wheels, camels, and horses filled the air as they set off. They were going home.
