Once upon a time, there was a huge battle!  Bhishma, a very strong warrior, fought for the Kauravas. He was so powerful, the Pandavas couldn't even look at him! He was like the sun, so hot and fierce!

All the Pandava soldiers attacked Bhishma, but he was too strong. He knocked down many brave warriors from the Panchala and Srinjaya armies.  Even though many soldiers died, they kept attacking!  Bhishma was amazing; he cut off the arms and heads of many warriors, even knocking down elephants!

Only Bhima, a very strong Pandava, could fight Bhishma.  When they fought, everyone shouted! The Pandavas cheered when Bhima fought bravely. Duryodhana and his brothers protected Bhishma.  Bhima was so strong, he even killed Bhishma's chariot driver!  The chariot ran away without a driver.  Bhima also killed many other Kaurava warriors, like Sunabha.

Seven of Duryodhanaâ€™s brothers got very angry when Bhima killed their friend. They attacked Bhima! They shot many arrows at him, but Bhima was tough. He fought back!  He killed Aparajita, Kundadhara, Panditaka, and Visalaksha.  He even killed Mahodara and Adityaketu! Finally, he killed Vahvasin too!

All Duryodhana's brothers were dead. Duryodhana was very sad. He said, "Bhima is too strong! We need to kill him!"  But even with many soldiers, the Kauravas couldn't win.  Duryodhana was very upset and went to Bhishma. He cried, "My brothers are all dead!  You're not helping us!"

Bhishma, with sad eyes, said, "I told you this would happen.  Drona and Vidura warned you, too. Bhima is unstoppable. Even the gods couldn't defeat him! You must fight bravely, my son, even if it means death, because the Pandavas can't be defeated."
