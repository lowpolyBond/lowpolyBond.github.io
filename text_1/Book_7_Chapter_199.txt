King Dhritarashtra was upset.  He said, "The great warrior Drona, a wise teacher, was insulted by Dhrishtadyumna! Dhrishtadyumna was a bad guy who even killed his own teacher!  Where were the brave warriors to stop him?  This is a shame!"

Sanjaya, Dhritarashtra's advisor, replied, "Everyone was quiet. Arjuna, a great warrior, looked at Dhrishtadyumna sadly and said, 'Shame!' The others felt embarrassed. But Satyaki, a very brave friend, shouted at Dhrishtadyumna, 'You are a terrible person! You killed your own teacher!  Everyone is angry with you! You should be ashamed!'  Satyaki was furious. He said Dhrishtadyumna’s family would suffer because of his actions.  He reminded Dhrishtadyumna that Arjuna didn’t kill Bhishma –  Sikhandin did, and Dhrishtadyumna’s father had planned it.  Satyaki threatened to hit Dhrishtadyumna with his big stick!"

Dhrishtadyumna answered angrily, "I’ve heard you, but I don't care! You're not a good person either!  You are the one who should be ashamed! You killed Bhurisravas even though he was defenseless! I did what I needed to do to win the war. The Pandavas and Kauravas both do bad things in war!  We all do bad things to win!"

Sanjaya continued, "Satyaki was so angry he shook all over! He wanted to fight Dhrishtadyumna!  Bhima, another strong warrior, saw this and stopped him.  Sahadeva, another brother, told Satyaki, 'We are friends with the Panchalas, and Dhrishtadyumna is a friend. We should forgive each other.'"

Dhrishtadyumna said, "Let him come at me! I’ll fight him! We need to win the war.  Let’s go fight!"  Satyaki was still angry, but Bhima and Sahadeva calmed them both down. Finally, everyone started to fight again.
