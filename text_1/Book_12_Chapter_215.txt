Bhishma, a wise old man, told a story. He said, "People get stuck when they want things too much.  They want yummy food, shiny toys, and fun games. But those things can cause trouble."

He explained that life is full of ups and downs. We get sick, we grow old, and we even die.  So, it's important to be happy no matter what.

"To be happy," Bhishma said, "be kind in your words and actions. Don't be boastful. Be peaceful and help others.  Even if you feel sorry for someone, remember that everything happens for a reason.  What you do, good or bad, has consequences."

"Be honest and kind to everyone.  Forgive others.  Don't be careless. Think good thoughts, speak good words, and do good deeds. That's how you find true happiness."

Bhishma said that we shouldn't want things we can't have, or things that aren't real. Instead, we should learn and grow.  If we try hard, we'll learn to be wise.

He said that honest words are important.  Don't say mean things.  Be gentle and truthful.  Our words have power, and they shape the world.

Bhishma said, "If you want to be truly happy, let go of wanting things.  Live simply, be peaceful, and focus on your inner self.  Control your feelings and thoughts."

He compared people who chase after things to thieves who run away with their loot. They're always scared!  If they want to be safe, they have to get rid of their stolen goods.  We should get rid of our bad feelings, too, to find true peace.

Bhishma said, "If you live simply, eat healthy food, are kind and quiet, and control your wants, you can find true happiness. This is like finding a peaceful place inside yourself, a place called Brahma."

He explained that we should train our minds to be peaceful and control our feelings.  When we do, we'll find inner peace. We shouldn't show off our calmness, but just quietly work on being good.  It's better to eat simple food, even if it's just what we can get by asking for help.

Bhishma said that we should follow rules and practices that help us become better people. We need to keep working at it, just like slowly building a fire. With practice, this inner peace will grow brighter, like the sun!

He added that some people think this inner peace is just for part of their lives—while they're awake, or dreaming, or asleep—but it's more than that.  Real peace is something bigger and better! Once we understand that, we'll be free from sadness and will find true, lasting happiness.
