King Dhritarashtra was talking to his advisor, Vidura.  Dhritarashtra wasn't listening to good advice from his friends, Bhishma and Drona. Vidura said, "King, Bhishma and Drona are wise and fair. They love you and the Pandava princes equally.  They only want what’s best for you. They've always given you good advice, and you've never hurt them. Why would they lie to you now?"

Vidura explained that the Pandavas – Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva – were Dhritarashtra's nephews, just as much as Duryodhana was his son.  He said, "Anyone telling you to hurt the Pandavas is not your true friend."

Vidura reminded Dhritarashtra how strong the Pandavas were.  "Arjuna is a great archer! Bhima is as strong as ten thousand elephants!  Nakula and Sahadeva are brave warriors!  Yudhishthira is wise and good. And they have amazing friends like Krishna fighting beside them!"  Vidura said it was foolish to fight such powerful warriors.

"King," Vidura continued, "You've been accused of something bad that Purochana did.  Show everyone you’re kind and fair by welcoming the Pandavas back.  If you treat them well, it will make everyone happy, and it's better than fighting.  Making peace with Drupada, their father-in-law, will make you even stronger.  Remember, where Krishna is, victory is!"

Vidura warned, "Duryodhana, Karna, and Sakuni are young and selfish. Don’t listen to them. They will lead you to disaster.  If you don't listen to wise advice, your kingdom will be destroyed!"  Vidura urged Dhritarashtra to make peace and be kind to the Pandavas, before it was too late.
