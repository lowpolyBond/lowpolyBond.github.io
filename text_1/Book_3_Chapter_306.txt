Once upon a time, in a faraway kingdom, a princess named Kunti had a baby.  This baby was very special; he looked like a shining star!  Kunti was worried because she wasn’t married yet.  She didn’t want anyone to know she had a baby.

Only her nurse knew her secret.  When the baby was born, he was strong and handsome, with big eyes and strong shoulders. He even wore tiny armor!  Kunti loved her baby very much.

To keep him safe, Kunti put him in a beautiful woven basket.  She lined it with soft blankets and a comfy pillow.  She felt so sad, she cried. Then, she took the basket to the Aswa River and gently placed it in the water.

As she let go, Kunti prayed: "My dear child, may everyone be kind to you. May your journey be safe and happy. May the river god protect you, and the sun god, your father, keep you safe always!  May all the gods watch over you!"

Kunti was very sad to leave her baby.  But she was afraid her father would be angry.  So, she went back home, her heart heavy with sorrow.

The basket floated down the Aswa River, then to the Charmanwati, then the Yamuna, and finally to the big Ganga River. The river carried the basket far away.

The baby’s special armor and magical earrings kept him safe.  The basket eventually reached a city called Champa.  There, a new adventure began for the little prince.  This is just the beginning of his amazing story!
