Once upon a time, Baladeva, a strong hero who used a plow as his weapon, traveled to many holy places. He visited many holy people and gave them gifts.  He was very kind and respectful.

One day, he went to a special place called Kapalamochana.  This place had a special name because of something that happened a long time ago.  A long, long time ago, Rama, a brave prince, fought a mean monster. He chopped off the monster's head! The head flew far away and landed on the leg of a wise holy man named Mahodara.  Ouch! It got stuck!

Mahodara was very sad. The head hurt, and it wouldn't come off! He tried bathing in many rivers and oceans, but nothing helped.  Finally, he heard about Kapalamochana.  When he bathed there, the monster's head fell off! He was so happy!  Because of this, the place was called Kapalamochana, which means "head release."

After Kapalamochana, Baladeva went to another holy place where many wise people lived.  This place was special because a very old holy man, Rushangu, had died there peacefully a long, long time ago.  Rushangu was so good that he chose this special place to die and go to heaven.  Another important holy man, Vishvamitra, had also become a wise person there.

Baladeva gave gifts to everyone he met. He visited many, many holy places, always being kind and respectful. He even went to a place where the mountains were created long ago! He was a very good and brave man.
