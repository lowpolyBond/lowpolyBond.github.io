Krishna went to his mother Kunti. He told her what happened at the Kuru assembly.  Duryodhana was being mean and wouldn't listen to anyone.  Krishna asked Kunti, "What should I tell the Pandavas? What is your wisdom?"

Kunti said, "Tell Yudhishthira this:  'You're being too kind, my son!  You're like someone who reads holy books but doesn't understand them. You only think about being good.  Remember who you are!  A Kshatriya, a warrior king, is meant to protect people, even if it means fighting.

"Long ago," Kunti continued, "King Muchukunda was offered the whole earth! But he said, 'I want to win a kingdom by fighting!' He became a great king because he was brave.  A king gets good karma by protecting his people.  If he does bad things, bad things will happen to him!  A good king keeps everyone doing their jobs:  Brahmins pray, Kshatriyas fight, Vaisyas trade, and Shudras work.  A good king brings a good time (a Krita Yuga)! A bad king brings bad times!  Your job is to rule fairly and bravely!

"Your grandfather, your father, and I always wanted you to be brave, generous, and strong. We wished for you wealth, children, and a long life! That's what a king should do!  But you, my son, are poor and suffering!  Hungry people need a strong king to feed them!  That's true goodness!  Use gifts, threats, clever tricks, or fighting to get back what is yours! You are a Kshatriya.  You must fight!  Don't let your family be defeated! Don't let your family be remembered as weak! Fight for what is right!"
