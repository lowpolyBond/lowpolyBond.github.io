Arjuna, the brave warrior, spoke to his brother Bhima.  "Bhima," he said, "you're my older brother. I can't say anything against you.  King Dhritarashtra is a good man, and we should always be kind to him. Good people don't hold grudges; they remember only the good things."

Yudhishthira, their wise older brother, heard Arjuna. He turned to Vidura, a wise counselor, and said, "Tell King Dhritarashtra that I will give him all the treasure he needs for the ceremonies for his son, Bhishma, and all the others who helped him.  I don’t want Bhima to be sad.”

Bhima was still angry, though. He glared at Arjuna. Yudhishthira saw this. He spoke to Vidura again. "Tell King Dhritarashtra that Bhima was very sad and suffered a lot while living in the forest.  Tell him he can take anything he wants from my palace. Tell him not to be angry with Bhima.  Tell him all my things, and all Arjuna’s things, belong to him.  He can give this wealth to the wise priests, give gifts to his sons and friends, and use it to pay back any debts.  Tell him I give him everything! My riches and even myself, I give to him.”
