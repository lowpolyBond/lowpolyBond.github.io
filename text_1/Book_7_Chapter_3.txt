The great warrior Bhishma, everyone's grandpa, lay on the ground.  He was hurt really badly.  Arjun, the best archer, had shot him with many arrows. Bhishma looked like a dried-up ocean, all alone and defeated.  The Kaurava soldiers felt very sad and scared. They had lost their hope of winning the battle.

Karna, a close friend of Bhishma and another brave warrior, jumped down from his chariot. He was heartbroken.  He walked to Bhishma and bowed down.

"Grandpa Bhishma," Karna said, his voice full of sorrow, "I am Karna. Please talk to me.  You are so wise and good, but look at you, lying here wounded!  No one can do the things you could.  You were the best leader, the best fighter, the best advisor! Now youâ€™re gone!"

Karna cried.  He knew without Bhishma, they were doomed.  Arjun was too powerful.  His arrows were like thunder.  They scared everyone.  Karna said, "Arjun is like a fire, and Krishna, his friend, is like the wind, making that fire burn even hotter!  Their battle cries make our soldiers tremble.  Arjun fought with even the gods! No one can beat him!"

Karna was worried. He knew Arjun was unbeatable.  "Even *I*, with all my strength, might not be able to stop him," he said, sadly.  "But I will try, Grandpa Bhishma,  if you give me your blessing."
