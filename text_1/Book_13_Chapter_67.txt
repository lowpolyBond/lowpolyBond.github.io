Yudhishthira, the kind king, asked his grandfather Bhishma, "Grandpa, I know giving gifts is good.  Giving food is especially great, but what about giving drinks? Tell me more!"

Bhishma, the wise old man, smiled. "My dear Yudhishthira, giving food and drink is the best kind of gift!  There’s nothing better.  All living things need food to grow strong and healthy. Even the gods said it’s a wonderful gift!  Giving food is like giving life itself!"

"Think about King Sivi," Bhishma continued. "He saved a pigeon's life, and because of that, he went to a wonderful place after he died.  Giving food to a holy man is like giving life, too."

"But what about drinks?" Yudhishthira asked.

"Ah, yes!" Bhishma said. "Everything comes from water!  The moon, the gods' nectar, the snakes' special drink, even the food we eat – all start with water. Plants and medicine grow because of water. Water gives life to everyone, from animals to people."

"So giving water or drinks is just as important as giving food," Bhishma explained. "It brings good luck, makes you famous, and helps you live a long and happy life. People will respect you, and you'll have no more worries! It cleanses you of bad things and takes you to a wonderful place after you die.  Even the great Mann said so!"
