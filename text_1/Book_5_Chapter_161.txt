Once upon a time, after the Pandavas set up their camp near the Hiranwati river, the Kauravas did the same.  Duryodhana, the Kaurava king, gathered his friends Karna, Dussasana, and Sakuni. He wanted to make a plan.

Duryodhana talked to Karna and Dussasana, then to all of them together.  Finally, he called Uluka, a clever man, secretly.

"Uluka," Duryodhana whispered, "go to the Pandavas. Tell Yudhishthira and Krishna this message:  The big battle we've been waiting for has arrived. Remember all those brave words you said?  Now's the time to prove them! Tell Yudhishthira, 'You're a good person, but how can you want to destroy the world? You should protect everyone!'

Duryodhana told Uluka a story.  "It's like a clever cat," he said. "The cat pretended to be holy near the river.  All the birds and mice thought he was a good guy.  They trusted him, asking for his help. The cat promised to protect them.  But secretly, the cat ate the mice every day! They carried him to the river, one by one!  Only a wise mouse, Dindika, figured it out, but even he was eaten. Then, the other mice ran away.”

Duryodhana said, "You, Yudhishthira, are like that cat! You say you're good, but you're planning a war!  Be a true warrior! Fight bravely and be honest!"

Then, Duryodhana gave Uluka more messages. He told him what to say to Krishna: "Fight me bravely! You said you would help the Pandavas win. Now, show me you mean it!"  Duryodhana told him what to say to Bhima: "Remember your promise to kill the Kauravas! Don't be a coward!  Be a real warrior!"

He gave messages for Nakula and Sahadeva too:  "Fight bravely! Remember all your suffering!"

Then, Duryodhana told Uluka to tell Virata and Drupada: "Fight for the Pandavas!  Help them win!" He also told him what to say to Dhrishtadyumna: "Fight Drona, your enemy!" And to Sikhandin: "Bhishma won’t kill you! Fight him bravely!"

Duryodhana laughed. He told Uluka to tell Arjuna: “Arjuna, either you defeat us and rule the world, or we defeat you and you'll die! Remember your suffering and your exile. Be a real warrior, and fight for what you believe in! Don’t be afraid of us!”

Duryodhana described his huge army – so many soldiers, like a giant, unstoppable ocean!  He said, “Arjuna, your army is small compared to mine!  How can you even hope to win?”


Finally, Duryodhana sent Uluka off, ready for war.  And the great battle was about to begin!
