Arjuna was angry!  His friend Krishna had given him good advice, but Arjuna still felt upset. He shouted at his brother, Yudhishthira, the king.

"You shouldn't scold me!" Arjuna yelled.  "You're miles away from the battle!  Bhima is the one fighting bravely! He’s killed thousands of enemies – elephants, soldiers, everything!  *He* can scold me, not you, who’s safe behind your friends!"

Arjuna told Yudhishthira about Bhima's amazing strength. He described how Bhima fought like a lion, smashing chariots and elephants.  "Bhima is a true warrior," Arjuna said. "He deserves to scold me, not you!"

Then, Arjuna got really mad. "You're safe and comfy while we fight! You caused all our problems because of your gambling.  You lost our kingdom! Because of you, we’re all fighting this terrible war!"  Arjuna was so upset, he pulled out his sword!

Krishna, his friend, stopped him. "Arjuna, why are you so sad? Why the sword?"

Arjuna said, "I want to kill myself! I'm so ashamed of myself!"

Krishna said, "Don't do that!  Killing yourself is worse than anything.  Tell me about your amazing bravery, and remind yourself of all your great victories!"

Arjuna told Krishna about all the battles he had won. He had defeated kings from all over the land! He was the best warrior, almost as good as the gods!  He would defeat Karna, the enemy warrior, and save everyone.  He put his sword away.

Arjuna went to Yudhishthira and said, "I'm sorry, brother.  I was wrong."

Yudhishthira felt terrible.  "I'm the bad one," he cried. "I caused all this. I deserve to be punished!"  He wanted to leave and live in the forest.

But Krishna smiled. "Yudhishthira, Arjuna was only angry because of a promise he made. It was all for your good. Arjuna will defeat Karna, and we will win the war! Forgive each other!"

Yudhishthira was relieved. He realized he had been unfair and forgave Arjuna. They were all very happy.  They were ready to fight again, together.
