Arjuna, the brave warrior, told his friend Lomasa, "Please tell my brother Yudhishthira to go on a special trip!  He should visit holy places called tirthas.  It will bring him good luck!"

Lomasa went to Yudhishthira and said, "Arjuna wants you to visit the tirthas!  It's a very important journey.  I'll go with you and protect you from scary monsters called Rakshasas.  They’re huge, like mountains!  Many great kings have gone on these journeys before."

Yudhishthira was so happy! He said, "I’ve already wanted to go! I'll leave whenever you're ready."

Lomasa said, "Let's travel light, King!  Only bring a small group."

Yudhishthira then said, "Only the strongest Brahmins and holy men should come. We need people who can handle long walks and don't need fancy food.  Anyone who needs a cook or special meals should stay behind. Let's send the others back to King Dhritarashtra. He'll take care of them. If not, the King of Panchala will."

Many people were sad to leave, but they went back to see King Dhritarashtra. He was kind and gave them what they needed.

Yudhishthira, with just a few Brahmins and Lomasa, stayed for three nights at a place called Kamyaka.  They were happy and ready for their big journey!
