Long ago, the gods were very worried.  Bad things were happening!  People, especially the wise Brahmins, were being killed at night. The gods knew that if the Brahmins disappeared, the whole world would end!  They were very scared.

They went to Vishnu, a powerful god, for help.  "Great Vishnu," they pleaded, "we don't know who is doing this terrible thing. Please save us!"

Vishnu knew the answer. "It's the Kalakeyas!" he said. "They are very mean and strong.  Their leader, Vritra, was defeated a long time ago, but they ran away and hid in the ocean."  The Kalakeyas were hiding among the sharks and crocodiles, sneaking out at night to hurt people.

"But," said Vishnu, "we can't fight them in the ocean! We need to dry up the sea!"  He knew just the god to help: Agastya.

The gods went to see Agastya, a very powerful and kind sage. They told him how scary things were.  They reminded him of all the times he had helped them before.  He had even stopped a bad king, Nahusha, and calmed down a giant mountain, Vindhya, which was growing so tall it blocked the sun!

The gods asked Agastya for help.  They knew that only he could dry up the ocean and save the world from the Kalakeyas! Agastya, being kind and powerful, agreed to help.
