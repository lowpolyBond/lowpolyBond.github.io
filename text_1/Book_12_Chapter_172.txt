Once upon a time, a kind bird named Rajadharman lived near a giant banyan tree.  He was friends with a Rakshasa king, Virupaksha.

One day, a mean Brahman named Gautama came to stay with Rajadharman. Rajadharman built a fire for his guest and went to sleep.  But Gautama was very bad!  He killed Rajadharman while he slept!  He cooked and ate the poor bird.

The next morning, the Rakshasa king couldn't find his friend. He worried. He asked his son to find Rajadharman.  

The son found Rajadharman's body under the banyan tree. He was so sad! He quickly caught Gautama.

The Rakshasa king was heartbroken.  He wanted to punish Gautama. He told his Rakshasas to eat Gautama’s body. But even the Rakshasas, who were scary and ate other people, refused! They said Gautama was too bad; even they wouldn't eat him.

The king decided to give Gautama to the robbers.  But guess what? The robbers didn't want him either!  They were too disgusted by his ungratefulness.

Bhishma then explained that there's punishment for many bad things – killing, stealing, breaking promises. But there’s no punishment bad enough for someone who is ungrateful like Gautama.  Even the robbers and the worms wouldn't touch him!  It shows how much worse being ungrateful is than other bad deeds.
