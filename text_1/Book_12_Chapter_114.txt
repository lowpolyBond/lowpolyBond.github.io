Once upon a time, a wise king named Yudhishthira asked his wise teacher, Bhishma,  "What should a kind person do if a mean person is being rude to them in public?"

Bhishma smiled. "My dear king," he said, "Let me tell you a story.  If someone is mean to you, don't get angry.  If you don't get angry, all the bad things that the mean person did come back to them. All the good things you did will stay with you!

Think of the mean person like a noisy bird making irritating sounds. Just ignore them! Getting angry is like wasting your life.  The mean person might even brag about being rude, like a silly peacock showing off its feathers.  They're like a crow cawing nonsense. It means nothing!

Don't even talk to such people. They are like a dog who only wags its tail for treats, then bites you when you're not looking. If they say bad things about you when you're not around, all their good deeds vanish!

Imagine a snake showing its dangerous hood. When mean people talk bad about good people, they're only showing how bad they are. Don't waste your time arguing; it's like a donkey stuck in mud.

Stay away from people like that! They are like angry wolves, or wild elephants, or fierce dogs.  Don't let them upset you. It's like arguing with a loud, silly person.   They might shout or throw things, but ignore it. Don't fight back.

If you remember this story, you will never feel hurt by mean words. Ignoring rude people is the best way to handle them."
