Once upon a time, in the epic story of the Mahabharata, there was a beautiful princess named Draupadi.  She was very brave and angry when a prince named Jayadratha insulted her husbands, the Pandava brothers.

"How dare you!" Draupadi shouted at Jayadratha. "You're insulting the strongest warriors in the world! They're like gods!  My husbands are brave and powerful. They fight like lions!  You’re like a tiny mouse trying to fight an elephant! Trying to fight them is like trying to pull hair from a sleeping lion!  You'll run away when you see my powerful husband Bhima!  Fighting Arjuna is like kicking a huge, angry lion in a cave! And fighting the younger Pandavas is like stepping on poisonous snakes! You’re making a big mistake!"

Jayadratha laughed. "I know how strong your husbands are," he said. "But we are princes too, and we think we are better!" He told Draupadi to get into his chariot, or he would take her by force.

Draupadi was furious.  "Even Indra, the king of the gods, wouldn't dare take me!" she said. "When my husbands arrive, they'll be like a wildfire! Arjuna's arrows will fly like a swarm of bees!  Bhima will smash you with his club!  They’ll catch you, and you’ll be sorry!"

Jayadratha, ignoring Draupadi's warnings, grabbed her clothes.  Draupadi pushed him away, and he fell down. But he grabbed her again. Draupadi, scared, called for Dhaumya, her wise advisor.

Dhaumya arrived and told Jayadratha, "You can't take her!  You have to fight and win against the Pandavas first!  If you don't, you will suffer!"

Jayadratha was still trying to take Draupadi away. Dhaumya followed them, hoping to protect the princess.  The story continues…
