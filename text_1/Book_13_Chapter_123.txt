King Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandpa, what makes a woman truly good?"

Bhishma smiled. "Long ago," he said, "in heaven, a lady named Sumana met a shining woman named Sandili.  Sandili was happy and bright, like a star. Sumana asked, 'How did you get to heaven?'"

Sandili answered, "I didn't do anything special like wearing funny clothes or shaving my head.  I was a good wife.  I never said mean things to my husband. I always worshipped the gods and helped my in-laws. I was honest and kind. I never gossiped or stayed out late. I never did anything wrong or hurt anyone. I kept secrets safe."

"When my husband came home, I welcomed him. I only ate food he liked. I woke up early to help my family. When he went away, I stayed home, doing good things, and I didn't wear fancy clothes or makeup until he returned. I let him sleep peacefully. I never pushed him to work too hard. I kept our home clean."

Sandili smiled. "A wife who does these things will be happy and honored, just like Arundhati!"  Then, Sandili disappeared.

Bhishma finished, "Anyone who reads this story every new moon and full moon will be happy and go to heaven!"
