Long ago, in a land far away, lived a powerful warrior named Krishna.  He was super strong and had a special bow and arrows. One day, he fought bad guys called Danavas.  They had a shiny, magical chariot that could disappear!

Krishna shot his arrows, which were like fast, flying snakes!  He couldn't see the chariot, it vanished like magic!  The Danavas yelled and howled.  Krishna had special arrows that could hear their shouts, and *whoosh!* he shot them down!

The chariot reappeared, and suddenly, BOOM! The Danavas threw tons of rocks at Krishna.  He was buried under a huge pile of rocks, like an ant hill!  His friends were scared and cried.  Even the sky and the earth seemed sad.

But Krishna was strong! He used Indra's magic hammer to break the rocks. His friends were so happy to see him again, like the sun coming out after a storm!  His horses were tired, and his driver told him, "Krishna, there's a bad guy named Salwa. You have to defeat him!"

Krishna knew his driver was right.  He got his amazing spinning fire-disc, Sudarshana.  It was so bright, like a second sun!  He threw the disc, and *whizz!* it destroyed Salwa's city, Saubha.  Then, *whizz!* it cut Salwa in half.  The Danavas ran away, screaming!

Krishna blew his horn, happy to have won. He had saved the day! He couldn't go to Hastinapura to help his friends because he was busy fighting Salwa. He was sad he missed it.

After that great battle, Krishna visited his friends, the Pandavas. They hugged him, and everyone was happy to see him.  Then, Krishna went home. Many people wanted to go with him, but some stayed to help the Pandavas.  The Pandavas prepared to go live in the forest.
