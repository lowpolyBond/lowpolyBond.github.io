Duryodhana was angry.  Krishna, a wise and powerful man, had said things Duryodhana didn't like.  "Krishna," Duryodhana said, "you're being unfair! You only blame me!  My cousins, the Pandavas, always treat you with respect, but you only scold me.  Have you even thought about who is stronger?"

He continued, "Everyone – even the King, our teacher, and our grandfather – blames only me. But I did nothing wrong!  In the dice game, the Pandavas lost fairly.  I even wanted to give them back their things! Then they lost again!  Why do they hate us so much? They're weaker than us, yet they want to fight!  What have we ever done to them?"

Duryodhana boasted, "They can't win!  We have Bhishma, Drona, Karna, and Kripa – they're unbeatable! Even the gods couldn't defeat them!  If we die in battle, that's a warrior's honor! We would rather die fighting than bow down to anyone in fear.  Only a coward would give up! A true warrior is brave, even if it means breaking like a strong stick, rather than bending like a weak one.  I only bow to wise priests. I will never give the Pandavas any land, as long as I live!  As long as our father, the King, is alive, we all should listen to him.  Even a tiny bit of our land will never be given to them!"
