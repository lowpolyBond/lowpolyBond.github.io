Once upon a time, a wise man named Tuladhara was talking to a priest named Jajali.  Tuladhara said, "Jajali, look!  See all the birds in the sky. Some are like your own children, birds you raised. They're all going home to their nests."

He pointed to the birds. "See how they carefully fly home? They love you, Jajali. Just like your children love you, they return to their nests."

Tuladhara continued, "Being kind to others is very important.  Doing good things helps you here and in the next life. But hurting others is bad. It makes you lose your goodness.  The best people are kind, calm, and do good things just because it's the right thing to do, not to get something in return."

"Faith is like the sun's daughter," Tuladhara explained. "It helps you be a good person and live a good life.  Even if you make a mistake, faith can help you. Faith is more important than anything else!  Even a generous person who's also a bad person is better than a miserly person who is good!"

Tuladhara told a story about some gods.  They judged some people's offerings.  At first, they got it wrong.  The best offerings came from kind, faithful people, not just rich people.  Faith makes your good deeds even better.  Without faith, your good deeds don't count.

Tuladhara said, "Faith is like shedding your old skin, leaving behind your badness. It's the best way to be good.  Everyone has faith, but some people's faith is better than others.  Be a good person, Jajali.  Have strong faith."

After that, both Tuladhara and Jajali went to heaven because they were so good and kind.  Tuladhara taught Jajali many important lessons about being good and kind to everyone.  He told him that the best way to be happy is by having faith and being kind.  Then he asked Jajali if he wanted to hear any more stories.
