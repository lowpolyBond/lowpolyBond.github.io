Once upon a time, a snake-person named Naga worked pulling the sun-god Surya's chariot.  A wise man asked Naga, "What amazing things did you see near the sun?"

Naga replied, "The sun is full of wonders!  All the creatures in the world came from the sun!  Wise people and gods live in the sun's rays, like birds in a tree.  The wind comes from the sun and blows all over the world! The sun makes rain – it divides the wind to make rain clouds.  The sun is so bright, it shows the whole universe!  The sun even has a dark part, which turns into rain clouds.  The sun drinks the rain for eight months, then sends it back down as rain.  The sun holds the soul of the whole world! It helps everything grow.  The sun is powerful and ancient – it has always been there!"

Then Naga said, "But the greatest wonder of all… I saw it with my own eyes! One day, at noon, while the sun shone brightly, a being as bright as the sun appeared.  It was so bright, it made the whole sky shine! This being flew towards the sun, making a path through the sky.  It was incredibly bright, like a huge, glowing fire!  We couldn’t even look at it! It looked like another sun! The sun welcomed it with open arms, and the bright being returned the greeting. Then, the bright being went inside the sun! They became one!  We couldn’t tell them apart! We asked the sun, 'Who was that bright being?' But even the sun didn't know!"
