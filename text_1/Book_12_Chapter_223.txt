Once upon a time, a king named Yudhishthira asked his grandpa, Bhishma, a very wise man, "Grandpa, how can a king who has lost everything still live happily?"

Bhishma said, "I'll tell you a story about Indra (the king of the gods) and Vali, a powerful demon. Indra had defeated all the demons, but he couldn't find Vali.  He asked a wise Brahman, 'Where is Vali?  He used to be so powerful! He was like the sun, the wind, the rain â€“ everything!'

The Brahman said, "Indra, it's not polite to ask about Vali like that, but I'll tell you.  Vali might be reborn as a camel, a bull, a donkey, or a horse. He might be living simply."

Indra asked, "If I find him, should I kill him or be nice?"

The Brahman said, "Don't hurt him! Learn from him instead."

So Indra looked everywhere.  He found Vali living in a simple stable as a donkey!  Indra was surprised. He said, "Vali! You used to be so grand, with thousands of servants and magical things!  Now you're just a donkey eating hay! Are you sad?"

Vali said, "You see only my bad luck now, Indra.  But wise people don't get too happy or too sad. You're boasting because you're winning.  When you lose, maybe you'll understand."

Bhishma finished the story. "See, Yudhishthira?  Even when things are bad, don't let sadness win. Be wise and strong."
