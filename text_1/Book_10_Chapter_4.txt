Ashwatthama was very angry. His father, Drona, had been killed!  Kripa, Ashwatthama's uncle, tried to calm him down.

"Ashwatthama," Kripa said, "you're burning with anger.  Let's get revenge tomorrow.  Tonight, rest. Take off your armor.  Kritavarma and I will be with you in the morning. We'll fight together.  You're a great warrior!  You can defeat the Panchalas!"

Kripa explained that together, they were a powerful team. Even the gods wouldn't be able to beat them!  He said, "Sleep now. Tomorrow, we'll attack. Weâ€™ll win!"

But Ashwatthama couldn't sleep.  He was too angry.  He said, "Uncle, how can I sleep? I'm filled with rage!  Seeing my father die... hearing the Panchalas boast... it burns me up inside! I must kill Dhrishtadyumna, who helped kill my father. I must avenge my father's death!"

Ashwatthama was also worried. The Pandavas were strong, protected by powerful warriors like Arjuna and Krishna.  He said, "Even the mighty god Indra couldn't beat them! But I will fight them anyway.  I'll kill many of my enemies first.  Then, I will finally sleep."

He was determined to fight, even though he knew it would be a difficult battle.  He wanted revenge, and he would not rest until he had it.
