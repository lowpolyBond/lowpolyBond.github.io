King Dhritarashtra asked his advisor, Sanjaya, "Sanjaya, tell me about the people who live in our land and the lands nearby.  Tell me about how long they live, how strong they are, what's good and bad about their lives, and what the past, present, and future hold."

Sanjaya answered, "Great King, our world goes through different ages called Yugas. There are four: Krita, Treta, Dwapara, and Kali.  Krita was the first.  Then came Treta, then Dwapara, and finally, Kali.

In Krita, people lived for 4,000 years! They were very strong, wise, and rich.  Lots and lots of wise saints lived then, too.  The warriors were also amazingâ€”strong, brave, and skilled with their bows and arrows.

In Treta, people lived for 3,000 years.  The warrior kings ruled huge kingdoms. They were brave and powerful.

Now, we are in Dwapara.  People live for 2,000 years.

In Kali, the last age, people don't live for a set amount of time.  Some even die before they are born or right after! People in Kali are not as strong or good as those in the past. They are often angry, greedy, and dishonest.  There isn't much of Dwapara left.

There are other lands besides ours. Haimavat is a better land than ours, and Harivarsha is even better than Haimavat!"
