Once upon a time, in the great battle of Kurukshetra, Duryodhana had a plan. He wanted Karna, his strong warrior friend, to win.  He told Karna, "Shalya, the king of Madra, will be your charioteer! He's even better than Krishna, the best charioteer ever!"  Shalya was like a super-fast driver for a super-fast chariot.

The next morning, Duryodhana told Shalya, "Drive Karna's chariot! Protect him, and he'll defeat Arjuna!" Shalya agreed. Karna was so happy! He said, "Get my chariot ready, quickly!"

Shalya made the chariot look amazing, shiny and bright like a cloud castle.  He even blessed Karna, wishing him good luck.  Karna prayed to the sun god, then he and Shalya climbed into the chariot. They looked like two suns shining brightly together!

Duryodhana told Karna, "Karna, defeat Arjuna and Bhima! Do what Drona and Bhishma couldn't do!  Win the war for us!"  The trumpets and drums roared loudly.

Karna, ready to fight, told Shalya, "Drive fast! I'll defeat Arjuna, Bhima, and everyone else!"

But Shalya worried. He said, "Karna, the Pandavas are very strong!  They are brave warriors, and they're really lucky.  When you hear Arjuna's bow, the Gandiva, it sounds like thunder! You might change your mind then!"

Shalya told Karna how powerful the Pandavas were – their arrows filled the sky like a storm cloud, and they were amazing fighters.  But Karna didn’t listen. He just said, "Drive!"  And the battle began!
