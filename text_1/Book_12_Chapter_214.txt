Long ago, in the land of Bharat, a wise old warrior named Bhishma taught a king about becoming a good person.  He said, "Being good is like a journey.  Humans are special, but the best are those who are wise and know the holy books."

Bhishma explained that knowing the right things to do is like having a map.  Without it, life is hard, like a blind person walking alone.  People try to be good, but it's difficult.  Being truly good means having a pure heart, mind, and words.  It means being honest and kind.

The best way to be good, Bhishma said, is through something called Brahmacharya.  It’s like training your mind to be strong.  It means controlling your thoughts and desires.  It's like a secret superpower!  If you do it perfectly, you'll achieve something amazing. If you try your best, you'll become even better.

Brahmacharya is very hard. It means not letting your thoughts wander to things you shouldn't think about, especially thoughts about girls.  If you have bad thoughts, you need to make up for it by being extra good.  It's like cleaning up a mess you made.

Bhishma explained how our bodies work.  There are tiny tubes inside us, like rivers. Some carry good things and some carry bad thoughts.  Bad thoughts come from seeing or thinking about things that are not right.  These bad thoughts create strong feelings.

A wise person learns to control these feelings and stop the bad thoughts.  If you can control your mind, you'll become wiser and better.  It's like burning away the bad things inside you until only good is left.

Bhishma said that if you learn to control your body and mind, you can reach a wonderful place where you're free and happy forever. It’s a long and hard journey, but the reward is worth it.  Just like a traveler overcomes obstacles on a path, a good person overcomes their bad feelings to find peace and happiness.
