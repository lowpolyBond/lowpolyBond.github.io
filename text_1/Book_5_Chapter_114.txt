Once upon a time, there was a wise man named Galava. He had been studying with a very powerful teacher, Viswamitra, for a very long time. When it was time to leave, Galava wanted to give his teacher a gift.  But Galava was poor!

Viswamitra, a little grumpy, said, "If you want to give me a gift, give me eight hundred special white horses! Each horse must have one black ear."

Galava was very sad. He couldn't find those horses!  His friend, Garuda, a powerful bird, helped him. Garuda explained that wealth is like magic. It comes from the earth and is protected by magical beings and a treasure king named Kuvera.  It's hard to find!

Garuda said, "Let's ask King Yayati for help! He's very rich and kind."

So Garuda and Galava flew to King Yayati's palace.  The king was very welcoming.  He offered them drinks and a place to wash their feet.  

Garuda told the king Galava's story. He explained how important it was for Galava to give his teacher the horses.  He said that giving a horse is a very good thing â€“ like giving a magic key to heaven!  

Garuda asked King Yayati to help Galava. He said giving the horses would make the king even more powerful and good. King Yayati, being a kind and generous king, agreed to help.  He gave Galava the eight hundred special horses!

Galava was so happy! He could finally give his teacher the gift and feel good about it. He went back to his studies, happier than ever. And King Yayati felt very good for helping his friend.
