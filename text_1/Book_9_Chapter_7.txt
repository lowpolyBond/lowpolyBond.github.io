King Duryodhana needed a strong leader for his army.  Shalya, a powerful king, agreed to help.  Shalya boasted, "I'm stronger than those two Krishna brothers! I could fight the whole world – gods, monsters, and people! I'll easily beat the Pandavas in battle!"  Duryodhana was so happy, he gave Shalya a special ceremony to make him the leader.  The Kaurava army cheered loudly! They were sure they would win.  They all praised Shalya, saying, "You’ll win!  You'll defeat everyone!" Shalya was thrilled.

Shalya shouted, "Today, I'll either defeat the Pandavas, or I'll die trying! Everyone will see how brave I am!" He promised to show everyone his amazing skills.

After Shalya became the leader, the Kauravas weren't sad about Karna's death anymore. They thought they’d already won!  They all slept happily.

But the Pandavas heard about Shalya.  King Yudhisthira worried, “Shalya is a great warrior! What should we do, Krishna?”

Krishna knew Shalya was very strong, maybe even stronger than Bhishma, Drona, or Karna! He said, “Only you, Arjuna, can defeat him.  Shalya is your uncle, but you must fight him.  You have to defeat him to win the war.”

Arjuna's uncle Shalya was a strong warrior.  Krishna knew that only Arjuna could defeat him. He urged Arjuna to fight Shalya even though he was his uncle.  Arjuna knew what he had to do.  After Krishna spoke, the Pandavas felt much better and slept peacefully.  They were happy because they had defeated Karna, and they felt confident that they would win the war.
