Once upon a time, the king of the gods, Nahusha, saw Indra's beautiful wife, Sachi.  He said, "Beautiful lady, I want to be your husband!"

Sachi was scared. She bowed her head and said, "Oh great king, I need time. I don't know where my husband Indra is.  I'll come back to you after I find him."

Nahusha said, "Okay, I'll wait."

Sachi went to the wise gods for help. They were worried about Indra. They went to the great god Vishnu.  They said, "Indra killed a holy person, and now he's in trouble!  What can we do?"

Vishnu said, "Indra needs to do a special sacrifice.  Then he'll be okay again.  And Nahusha will be punished for his bad actions.  Just be patient."

The gods did the special sacrifice for Indra.  Indra shared the bad thing he did with the trees, rivers, mountains, earth, and women.  He felt better!

But Indra was still afraid of Nahusha, who was very powerful.  So Indra hid himself.

Sachi was very sad. She prayed to the night goddess, "Please help me!  Let me stay true to my husband!"  She asked the night goddess to show her where Indra was.

And that's how Sachi started her search for her hidden husband.
