Once upon a time, after a monkey friend left, the super-strong Bhima went on a journey. He was thinking about his amazing monkey friend and the great prince Rama.  Bhima walked through a beautiful forest.  He saw pretty flowers, sparkling rivers, and lots of trees. He even saw muddy elephants that looked like big, gray clouds!

He saw deer munching on grass and lots of other animals like buffaloes, bears, and leopards.  The forest smelled wonderful!  He walked past lakes filled with lotus flowers.  Lots of busy bees buzzed around them.  Bhima kept going, remembering his wife Draupadi's words.

When the sun was high in the sky, he found a big river!  It was full of shiny, golden lotus flowers.  Pretty swans and other birds swam there, too.  The river looked like a beautiful necklace of flowers around the mountain!  

And there they were!  Bhima found the special Saugandhika lotus flowers he was searching for. They shone like the sun!  Bhima was so happy. He knew he had found what he needed, and he thought about his wife, who missed home.
