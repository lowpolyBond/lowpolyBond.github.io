Arjuna asked, "Who is the best at worshipping you, God?"

God said, "Those who always think of me and believe in me completely are the most devoted.  But others can also get close to me.  These are people who think about the unseen, powerful God, the one everywhere. They control their feelings, are kind to everyone, and help others.

It's hard to think only about the unseen God.  It's a difficult path.  But there's another way.  You can worship me by doing everything for me.  Just think of me when you work and play.  If that's too hard, just do your best and don't worry about the results.  If *that's* too hard, just try to be calm and peaceful and let go of wanting things.

The best way is to be calm and peaceful.  This is better than knowing things about me; and knowing things is better than just trying hard.

I love people who are kind to everyone, don't get angry easily, and aren't boastful.  I love people who are happy or sad without changing who they are.  They are calm and always think of me.  I love people who don't let the world bother them, and who don't bother the world.  They don't worry or get angry.

I love people who are pure, hardworking, and don't get upset easily. They don't do things for what they get back.  I love people who don't get excited or sad. They don't want good things or bad things to happen. They just trust me.

I love people who treat everyone the same, whether they are friends or enemies.  They don't care about being honored or not, hot or cold, happy or sad. They donâ€™t care if people say good or bad things about them. They are quiet and happy with what they have. They don't have a house; they have a strong mind and trust in me.  These people are my dearest friends."
