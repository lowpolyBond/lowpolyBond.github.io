Abhimanyu was a brave warrior.  Many arrows had hit him, but he still smiled! He saw Duhsasana, a mean and boastful enemy.  "It's lucky I found you!" Abhimanyu said. "You were rude to King Yudhishthira and Bhima. You cheated in a game and bragged about it! Now you'll pay for your bad actions! You stole things, you were angry, and you didn't care about being fair. You even took away my family's kingdom! I will punish you!"

Abhimanyu shot a powerful arrow.  It flew like a fast snake and hit Duhsasana's shoulder.  Then, he shot 25 more arrows!  Duhsasana fell down, hurt and dizzy. His driver quickly took him away from the battle.

The Pandavas – Abhimanyu's friends and family – cheered loudly! They were so happy!  But Duryodhana, a mean Kaurava king, was angry. He saw Duhsasana get hurt by Abhimanyu. He told Karna, a strong warrior, to help him.

Karna rained arrows down on Abhimanyu.  But Abhimanyu was strong. He shot 37 arrows back at Karna! He kept fighting towards Drona's army, even though many arrows hit him.  He didn't feel the pain!

Abhimanyu, still smiling, shot even more arrows. He broke Karna's bow, his flag, and even knocked down his chariot!  Then Karna’s brother attacked Abhimanyu. But the Pandavas cheered even louder for their brave friend!
