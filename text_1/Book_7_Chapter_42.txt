Once upon a time, during a great war, Abhimanyu, Arjuna's brave son, fought the Kaurava army.  He was super strong and skillful with his bow and arrow. He zoomed into the enemy lines, like a playful dolphin splashing in the ocean!

The Kaurava warriors, big and strong, rushed to stop him.  It was a huge battle! Abhimanyu was surrounded, but he fought bravely. He even knocked Vrishasena's chariot driver off his feet and broke his bow!  Then he shot Vrishasena's horses, making his chariot speed away.  Everyone cheered, "Wow!  Amazing!"

Then, a powerful warrior named Vasatiya attacked Abhimanyu.  He shot sixty golden arrows and shouted, "You won't escape me alive!"  But Abhimanyu, even with his armor on, fought back and hit Vasatiya so hard that he fell to the ground.

Seeing Vasatiya fall, many more Kaurava warriors got angry.  They all attacked Abhimanyu at once!  It was a terrible fight.  Abhimanyu fought so hard that he broke their bows, arrows, and even cut off their arms and heads!

The battlefield was a mess!  Everywhere you looked there were broken chariots, dead horses and elephants, scattered jewelry, and broken weapons. It was a terrible, scary sight.

Abhimanyu fought so fiercely, moving so fast, that people could barely see him!  All they could see were his shiny armor, his bow and arrows, and the gold jewelry he wore. He fought like the bright sun, shining and powerful, in the middle of a dark storm.
