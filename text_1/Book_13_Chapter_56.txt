Long ago, a wise man named Chyavana visited King Kusika.  Chyavana had a prophecy to share. He said, "King, there's a big secret about your family and mine.  A long time ago, there was a big fight between my ancestors (the Bhrigus) and your warrior ancestors (the Kshatriyas). The warriors hurt my family badly.  

But don't worry!  From my family will come a strong, brave man named Urva. He'll be so angry about what happened, he'll almost destroy the world!  But he'll calm down and have a son, Richika.  Richika will teach his son, Jamadagni, all about fighting.  Jamadagni will marry a princess from your family!

That princess will have a son, Viswamitra, who will be a very wise and powerful king.  In return, your family will get a strong warrior from my family."

King Kusika was happy to hear this.  He asked Chyavana for a wish. He wanted his family to always be kind and good, like wise people. Chyavana made it so!

The prophecy came true.  Viswamitra, the wise king, was born into the king's family, and a great warrior named Rama was born into Chyavana's family. That's how the two families became related!  Everything happened just as Chyavana had said.
