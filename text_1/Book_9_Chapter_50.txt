Once upon a time, there lived a very good and kind wise man named Devala. He was always fair and helped everyone. He treated everyone the same, rich or poor. He prayed to the gods every day and welcomed guests.

One day, another wise man named Jaigishavya came to live with Devala. Jaigishavya was very special. He spent his time praying and meditating.  Devala watched him closely, but Jaigishavya never spoke a word!

One day, Devala didn't see Jaigishavya. Later, at dinner time, Jaigishavya appeared, asking for food. Devala was happy to see him and gave him a big meal.  He wondered why Jaigishavya was so quiet.

Devala went to the ocean to pray.  To his surprise, Jaigishavya was already there!  Devala was amazed. How could Jaigishavya get there first?  When Devala returned, Jaigishavya was already back at the house!

Curious, Devala flew up into the sky. He saw Jaigishavya being worshipped by magical beings! He watched as Jaigishavya visited many heavenly places, even the homes of the gods!  Then, Jaigishavya disappeared.

Devala asked the magical beings where Jaigishavya had gone. They said he went to a wonderful place far beyond. Devala tried to follow, but he couldnâ€™t.

When Devala returned home, Jaigishavya was sitting there. Devala, amazed by Jaigishavya's powers, asked to learn his secrets. Jaigishavya taught him.

Then, everyone started to cry! They were worried that Devala wouldn't help them anymore.  Devala thought about it. He knew helping others was important too. So, he decided not to leave his home, but to continue to be kind and help everyone, learning from Jaigishavya's example.  Everyone was happy. Devala learned that being kind and helpful was the most important thing.  The gods were very pleased with both Devala and Jaigishavya.
