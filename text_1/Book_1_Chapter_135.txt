Once, Drona, Arjuna's teacher, wanted to test his students' skills. He put a bird on a tree.  He asked each student to shoot the bird.  But there was a trick!  He wanted them to only see the bird, not the tree or him.

Everyone missed.  Then it was Arjuna's turn.  Drona asked, "Arjuna, do you see the bird, the tree, and me?"

Arjuna said, "I only see the bird, teacher!"

Drona smiled. "Describe the bird," he said.

Arjuna said, "I only see its head!"

Drona was very happy!  He yelled, "Shoot!"  Arjuna's arrow flew and hit the bird perfectly!

Later, Drona and his students went swimming in the river.  A big, scary alligator grabbed Drona's leg!  Drona called for help.

The other students were scared, but Arjuna quickly shot five arrows!  He killed the alligator.  Drona was so impressed!

Drona gave Arjuna a super-powerful weapon called Brahmasira.  It was so strong, it could destroy the whole world!  Drona said, "Use it only against monsters, never against people!"

Arjuna promised to be careful.  Drona told him, "You are the best archer ever! You will never be defeated!"  Arjuna was very proud and happy.
