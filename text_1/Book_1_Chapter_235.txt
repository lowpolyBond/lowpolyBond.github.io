Once upon a time, a wise man named Mandapala lived in a forest with his family. He had many children with his first wife, Jarita.  He also had a second wife, Lapita.

A big fire started in the forest! Mandapala was worried about his children. They couldn't fly or move quickly, so he was scared the fire would hurt them. He cried to Lapita, "The fire is so big!  My children are in danger! How will they escape?"

But Lapita was jealous of Jarita. She said, "Don't worry!  You talked to the fire god, and he promised to protect them. You're just worried because you miss Jarita!"  Lapita was angry and told Mandapala to go to Jarita.  She said she would leave him.

Mandapala said, "No, I'm just worried about my children!  I need to make sure they are safe."

The fire went away. Jarita rushed to find her children.  They were safe!  She hugged them tightly and cried with happiness.  Then Mandapala came. But his children and Jarita were still upset with him.

Mandapala asked, "Which one is my oldest son?  And the youngest?"  Jarita was still angry. She snapped back, "What do you care? Go back to Lapita!"

Mandapala explained, "Having two wives causes so much trouble. Even Arundhati, a good woman, was jealous of her husband once, and now she's a tiny star! I'm sorry, I only want what's best for our children."

Slowly, Mandapala's children forgave him. They hugged him, and everything was alright again.  He loved them, and they loved him.
