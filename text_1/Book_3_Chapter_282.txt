Once upon a time, Rama's army camped near Lanka.  They had plenty of food and water.  Ravana, the king of Lanka, had a super strong city! It had seven deep moats full of fish, sharks, and crocodiles.  There were sharp wooden stakes, and the walls were protected by giant catapults.  The guards had weapons like pots of snakes, fire, and big clubs.  

Angada, a brave monkey, went to Lanka to talk to Ravana. He walked right into the city!  He was so handsome, he looked like the sun shining through the clouds.  Angada told Ravana, "Rama says, you took Sita!  You hurt many people.  Return Sita, or we will fight!"

Ravana was very angry! Four strong Rakshasas grabbed Angada. But Angada was super strong! He jumped so high he landed on the palace roof.  Then he jumped over the city walls and went back to Rama.

Rama and his army attacked Lanka.  Thousands of monkeys and bears attacked the walls.  The monkeys were all different colors â€“ yellow, grey, red, and white! So much dust flew up, you couldn't even see the sun!  The monkeys pulled down the walls and broke the catapults.

Then, many scary Rakshasas came out to fight.  It was a big battle! Monkeys and Rakshasas fought with their claws and teeth.  Many monkeys and Rakshasas got hurt. Rama and Lakshmana shot lots of arrows.  Finally, Rama's army won! They broke down Lanka's walls, and the city was ready for Rama to take back Sita.
