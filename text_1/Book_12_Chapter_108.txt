King Yudhishthira asked his wise grandpa, Bhishma, "Grandpa, what's the most important thing to do to be a good person?"

Bhishma smiled.  "My dear Yudhishthira," he said, "the most important thing is to honor your mother, father, and teacher.  They are like the most important fires in the world!"

"Your father is like the home fire," Bhishma explained. "Your mother is like the south fire.  And your teacher is like the fire where we make offerings to the gods."

"If you respect and obey them," Bhishma continued, "you'll be happy and successful.  Always do what they ask, unless it's wrong. Never disobey them.  Serving your father helps you in this life. Serving your mother helps you in the next life. Serving your teacher helps you reach heaven!"

Bhishma said that your teacher is even more important than your parents.  "Your parents give you your body," he said,  "but your teacher gives you wisdom and a good life that lasts forever."

"Never hurt or disrespect your parents or teacher," Bhishma warned. "Even if they make mistakes, you should always be kind and respectful.  The gods will be happy with you if you do."

He went on,  "A good son takes care of his parents when they're old.  Anyone who hurts their parents or teacher is doing something very, very bad.  It’s like killing a baby before it’s even born!"

Bhishma explained, "Showing love and respect to your parents and teacher is the most important thing you can do. It will bring you happiness in this life and the next. There is nothing more important."
