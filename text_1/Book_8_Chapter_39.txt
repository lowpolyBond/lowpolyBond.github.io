Shalya, Karna's charioteer, tried to warn him. "Karna," he said, "don't give away your amazing golden chariot! You're being silly, giving away such treasure. You'll see Arjuna today, and you'll wish you hadn't given it away.  It's like a fox trying to fight two lions. You're heading into trouble!"

Shalya continued, "You're acting like someone trying to swim the ocean with a big stone tied around their neck!  You can't win against Arjuna.  Fight him *with* your army,  not *without* it. I'm saying this to help you, not to hurt you. Please, listen to me, save your life!"

But Karna was too proud. "I'll fight Arjuna with my own strength!" he shouted. "No one, not even the mighty Indra, can stop me!"

Shalya, wanting to make Karna understand, kept trying.  "When Arjuna's arrows fly, you'll wish you'd listened," he said. "It's like a baby trying to grab the moon!  You're going to fight a powerful warrior with a tiny stick! It's like a little deer challenging a huge angry lion!  A fox challenging a king of the jungle! A tiny hare challenging a giant elephant!  A small frog croaking at a giant storm! A little dog barking at a tiger!  A jackal pretending to be a lion! You're weak compared to Arjuna, like a mouse to a car, a dog to a tiger, a fox to a lion."

Shalya went on, "You think you're brave, but you haven't seen Arjuna's real power.  When you hear his bow Gandiva, and see him fight, you'll be scared.  You'll be the jackal, and he'll be the lion â€“ always."  He concluded, "It's like comparing a lie to truth, poison to honey.  That's how different you and Arjuna are."
