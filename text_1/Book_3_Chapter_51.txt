King Dhritarashtra was worried. He’d heard about the Pandavas, the five brothers who were so strong and kind to each other.  He sighed, "My charioteer, Sanjaya, I can't sleep! I worry about my sons' bad actions.  The Pandavas are so brave and clever!"

He told Sanjaya how amazing the Pandavas were. Nakula and Sahadeva were like gods, unbeatable in battle. Bhima was super strong, like a lion, and Arjuna was a great archer.  Dhritarashtra feared, "With Bhima and Arjuna, and those amazing Pandava brothers, my army will be defeated! They'll be so angry about what happened to Draupadi!"  He knew even his best warriors couldn't stand against them. The sound of Arjuna's bow, the Gandiva, would be like thunder, and Bhima's mace would crush everything.

"I listened to Duryodhana," Dhritarashtra said sadly, "but now I wish I had listened to my wise friends instead!"

Sanjaya said, "King, you should have stopped your son from being so mean!  Krishna, the wise hero, went to comfort the Pandavas in the forest. He was angry to see how they were treated.  Draupadi’s sons, and many other brave warriors, were with them."

Sanjaya explained that Krishna, after seeing the Pandavas, had promised to help them.  He said, "The Pandavas will get back everything they lost.  With the help of Bhima, Arjuna, and all their brave friends, they'll defeat your sons, including Duryodhana and Karna." Krishna even promised to help them win back their kingdom.  Yudhishthira agreed, but asked Krishna to wait thirteen years.

Sanjaya continued, "The Pandavas and their friends, including Krishna, Bhima, and Arjuna, are all ready for war.  Who would want to fight them? They are fierce warriors, like angry lions!"

Dhritarashtra remembered what his wise advisor, Vidura, had said: "If you fight the Pandavas, it will lead to a terrible war that will destroy us all."  Now, he knew Vidura was right. The war was coming.
