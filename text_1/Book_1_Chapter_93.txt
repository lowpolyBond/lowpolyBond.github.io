Once upon a time, there lived a great king named Yayati.  Three good kings, Vasumat, Sivi, and Ashtaka, wanted to go to heaven.  They asked Yayati, who knew all about the heavens, if they had earned a place there.

Yayati told them yes, they had earned many heavenly places!  Each king was so happy, he offered his heavenly reward to Yayati.  "You can have my place in heaven!" said Vasumat. Sivi said the same thing.  They didn't want their heavenly rewards, they wanted Yayati to have them!

Yayati was a very honest king. He said, "I can't take your places in heaven. That wouldn't be fair."

Ashtaka then said, "But if we don't go, we'll go to a bad place!"  They all worried.

Yayati saw five shiny golden chariots.  "These will take you to heaven," he said.  "Let's all go together!"

So they all rode to heaven in the golden chariots.  Ashtaka was surprised to see Sivi go first.  "Sivi went first," he said, "because he was so kind and gave away everything he owned. He was very good and honest!"

Yayati explained, "I'm Yayati, your great grandfather! I was a king who ruled the whole world. I always told the truth, and I was very generous. I gave lots of gifts to good people. That’s why I’m going to heaven, too."

Yayati told them that truthfulness is the most important thing.  Everyone who is truthful and kind can go to heaven. Then, Yayati, Vasumat, Sivi, and Ashtaka all went happily to their places in heaven.  And everyone remembered Yayati's kindness and honesty.
