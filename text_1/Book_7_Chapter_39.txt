Once upon a time, in a great battle, Abhimanyu, a brave warrior, fought very bravely.  He was amazing!  He was like his father and grandfather, super strong and skilled.

Then, Karna's brother jumped in.  He shot many arrows at Abhimanyu, hitting his umbrella, his chariot, even his horses!  The other warriors cheered for Karna's brother.

But Abhimanyu was strong!  He smiled, aimed his arrow, and with one shot, he cut off Karna's brother's head!  Karna was very sad to see his brother fall.

Abhimanyu was angry. He fought many more warriors. He was so strong he made the enemy army scatter!  He shot so many arrows, the sky was filled with them, like a rain of arrows!  Many, many enemy warriors fell.  

Abhimanyu fought like a fire in dry grass! He smashed chariots, elephants and soldiers!  The battlefield was a mess of broken chariots, fallen soldiers, and dead elephants.  It was hard to even see through all the chaos.

The enemy soldiers were so scared, they ran away, bumping into each other!  Everywhere you looked, there were broken weapons, and fallen bodies.  The noise of the battle was deafening!

Abhimanyu was so strong and quick, it was hard to even see him as he fought.  He was like the sun, shining brightly as he fought!  He was as brave as the greatest warrior god!

Even though he faced many, many enemies, Abhimanyu fought bravely.  He was a truly amazing warrior!
