Once upon a time, there was a great battle in the Mahabharata.  Sanjaya, a wise man, was watching and telling King Dhritarashtra what he saw.

Arjuna, a brave warrior, charged into battle against Bhishma.  Arjuna's chariot was magnificent!  Its flag looked like a roaring lion and shone like a bright mountain.  His bow, Gandiva, sounded like thunder.  Everyone was scared!

Arjuna fought so hard! His shouts were like the mighty god Indra's roar!  His arrows flew everywhere, like a storm!  It was so dusty and loud, you couldn't tell east from west.  The soldiers were afraid. They huddled together behind Bhishma for protection.

Arjuna's army was huge!  There were many soldiers, elephants, and horses!  They all fought bravely. King Yudhishthira and his brothers fought alongside Arjuna.  Many, many kings fought on both sides.  There were elephants, horses, and chariots everywhere!

The battlefield was a terrible sight.  It was dusty and loud.  Broken chariots, dead soldiers, and fallen elephants were everywhere.  The sun was even hidden behind the dust!  It was a huge, messy, scary battle!  Broken chariots crashed to the ground. Elephants pushed chariots around like toys.  Arrows and weapons flew through the air.

It was a very, very big and terrible battle!
