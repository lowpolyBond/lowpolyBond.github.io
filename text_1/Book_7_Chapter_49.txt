King Yudhishthira was very sad.  His nephew, Abhimanyu, a brave young warrior, had been killed in battle.  

After the fight, the Pandava soldiers took off their armor and sat around Yudhishthira.  They were all very upset.

Yudhishthira cried, "Oh, Abhimanyu!  He bravely fought through the enemy's army, led by Drona. He even chased away the mean Duhsasana!  But he was too young, he was killed by Duhsasana's son.  How can I ever face Arjuna and Subhadra, Abhimanyu's parents?  I made him fight, a young boy. It was wrong. It was all my fault.  We should have protected him!"

Yudhishthira felt terrible. He said, “Abhimanyu was a child! He needed food and a soft bed, not a battlefield! He was brave like a horse, always ready to obey. We sent him to fight, and now he is gone. I feel like we are all going to die.  Arjuna will be so angry. He will take revenge for his son.”

Arjuna, Abhimanyu's father, was a great warrior. He had defeated many terrible enemies. He was strong, kind and brave. Even the gods praised him! But Yudhishthira knew that Arjuna's rage would be terrible.  He worried that the Kauravas, the enemy, would also pay a heavy price.  Yudhishthira was so sad that he didn’t even care about winning the war anymore. He just wanted Abhimanyu back.  He felt heartbroken.
