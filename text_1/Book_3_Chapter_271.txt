After the Pandava brothers were tricked and lost everything, they had a very hard time.  They were sad and angry.

One day, after they fought a big battle and saved Draupadi from the mean King Jayadratha, they talked to a very wise old man named Markandeya.  Yudhishthira, the oldest Pandava brother, was very upset.

He said, "Wise Markandeya, you know so much about the past and the future.  Draupadi is special.  She was born from a fire sacrifice, not like a normal baby. She's a good and kind woman, and she's my wife.  King Jayadratha kidnapped her, even though she never did anything wrong.  Why did this happen?  How could such a bad thing happen to someone so good?"

Yudhishthira felt terrible.  He said, "We are living in the forest.  It's hard. We have to hunt animals for food. Our cousins tricked us and made us live like this.  Is there anyone in the whole world who is more unlucky than me?"

Markandeya listened patiently to Yudhishthira's sadness.  He understood how unfair everything seemed.  He was ready to offer Yudhishthira comfort and wisdom, but that's a story for another time.
