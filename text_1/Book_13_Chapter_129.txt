Long ago, a wise man named Lomasa told a story.  He said, "Imagine the spirits of our ancestors, called Pitris. They get very sad if someone does bad things."

He explained, "It's very wrong to be with someone else's wife. It's also wrong to be with a woman who can't have babies. And it's really bad to take things that belong to a priest."

Lomasa said, "If you do these things, your ancestors will be angry, and they won't help you. Your prayers won't work either."

"So," he continued, "always be good!  Listen to your teachers and elders. Every month, on special days, give gifts to priests. Give them yummy ghee (clarified butter) and special grains."

"Doing this is like making the ocean bigger and stronger!" Lomasa exclaimed. "The gods will be happy, and you’ll be strong and lucky too!"

He shared another secret: "Wake up early, take a bath, and wear white clothes. Give priests bowls of sesame seeds.  Give water mixed with sesame seeds and honey to your ancestors. Give lamps and special food called Krisara.  This makes your ancestors very happy!"

Lomasa said, "Giving these gifts is like giving cows, land, or even doing a big, fancy sacrifice! The gods and ancestors love these gifts. They're very, very happy when you're kind and good.”
