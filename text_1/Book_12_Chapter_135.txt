Once upon a time, a brave robber named Kayavya lived in the forest. His father was a warrior, and his mother was from a forest tribe.  Kayavya was strong and smart. He knew the forest like the back of his hand. He could shoot his arrows perfectly! He was also kind.  He helped holy men, or ascetics, who lived peacefully in the woods. He even protected them!

Kayavya loved animals, even though he hunted deer sometimes. He carefully hunted, and only took what he needed.  Every day, he visited his old, blind, and deaf parents to take care of them.  He gave them yummy food. He also shared his food with others, especially those who needed it.  He treated everyone with respect. If he couldn't give food to the ascetics directly, he'd secretly leave it at their doors.

One day, many other robbers asked Kayavya to be their leader. They knew he was wise and brave. Kayavya agreed, but he had rules.  "Never hurt women, children, or peaceful people," he said. "Always respect holy men, and be truthful. Don't steal from those who worship gods.  We will only take from those who deserve it. We will use our strength to help, not to hurt!"

The other robbers listened to Kayavya. They followed his rules and became good people. They were still robbers, but they were kind robbers!  Because they were good, they were safe and happy.  Kayavya was a good leader, and he went to a happy place after he died.

The story of Kayavya teaches us that even if someone does something wrong, they can still be kind and good.  If you are kind and do what is right, you won't have to be afraid of anything!
