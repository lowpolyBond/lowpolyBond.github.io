Once upon a time, there was a great warrior named Bhishma. He fought a very strong enemy named Rama.

The next morning, the sun shone brightly.  Rama, in his fast chariot, shot many, many arrows at Bhishma.  It was like a rain of arrows!  Bhishma's charioteer was hurt. He fell down and sadly died.  Bhishma was very sad.

While Bhishma was still grieving, Rama shot another arrow. This arrow hit Bhishma!  Rama thought Bhishma was dead, and he shouted with joy.  The Kauravas, Bhishma's friends, were very, very sad.

Suddenly, eight shining holy men appeared. They held Bhishma up in the air so he wouldn't touch the ground. They said, "Don't worry!  Everything will be alright!"  Bhishma saw his mother, Ganga, a powerful river goddess, who had been helping him!

Bhishma thanked his mother and the holy men. He got back in his chariot and kept fighting Rama until the sun went down.

Then Bhishma shot a powerful arrow at Rama! Rama fell down, unconscious.  The sky turned dark.  There was thunder and lightning.  Animals cried out. It was a very scary sight!

But Rama stood up again, angry and ready to fight!  They fought some more, but then the sun set, and they stopped.  This happened for 23 days!  They fought every day until the sun went down, and then started again the next day.  It was a long and very fierce battle!
