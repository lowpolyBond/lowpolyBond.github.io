Yudhishthira, the eldest Pandava brother, was very curious.  Arjuna had just returned from a long trip to heaven!  "Arjuna," he asked, "tell us all about your amazing journey! How did you meet the gods? What amazing weapons did you get?"

Arjuna smiled.  "My dear brother," he said, "it all started when you told me to go practice really hard.  I went to the forest. I spent a month eating fruits and roots. Then a month drinking only water! The next month I ate nothing at all.  For the fourth month, I held my arms up high – it was hard, but I didn't get weak!

"On the first day of the fifth month, a scary boar appeared! A hunter, with a bow and arrows, was chasing it.  I shot an arrow at the boar, but the hunter was angry.  'That's my boar!' he shouted.  He started shooting arrows at me!

"It was a big fight! He kept changing shape, sometimes small, sometimes huge! I used all my best arrows, but he swallowed them!  Then we even wrestled! I was so tired, I fell down.  The hunter laughed, then *poof* – he disappeared!

"Suddenly, a wonderful god appeared! It was Lord Shiva, the great god who destroys and creates.  He was very happy with me. He said, 'You did great, Arjuna! Ask for a wish!'  I said, 'Please, give me the best weapons!'

"Lord Shiva smiled. He gave me the Pasupata weapon – the most powerful weapon ever! He warned me to only use it if I'm in real danger, because it's so strong it could destroy the whole world! And then...he vanished!"

Yudhishthira and his brothers were amazed. "Wow!" they all exclaimed.  "That's quite a story, Arjuna!"
