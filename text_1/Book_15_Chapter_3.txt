Once upon a time, after a big war, King Yudhishthira ruled the Kuru kingdom.  He and his uncle, the blind King Dhritarashtra (Duryodhana's dad), seemed friendly at first. But Dhritarashtra secretly disliked Bhima, Yudhishthira's strong brother.

Bhima, feeling angry about the war and what Duryodhana had done, wasn't nice to Dhritarashtra either. He secretly disobeyed Dhritarashtra's orders and even playfully slapped his armpits in front of Dhritarashtra and his queen, Gandhari!  Bhima boasted loudly about defeating Duryodhana and his brothers in battle.

Dhritarashtra was very sad and upset by Bhima's words.  Gandhari, his wise queen, knew Bhima was bragging, but Dhritarashtra felt the pain deeply.  For many years, the king's heart ached.  He felt terrible about the war and the loss of his sons. Nobody else—not even Yudhishthira, Arjuna, or their mother Kunti—knew how sad he truly was.

One day, Dhritarashtra finally shared his sorrow with his closest friends. He told them he felt guilty. He had listened to his wicked son, Duryodhana, instead of the good advice given by wise people like Vidura, Bhishma, Drona, Kripa, and Vyasa.  Dhritarashtra said he regretted not supporting the Pandavas more.

To show his sorrow, Dhritarashtra started eating very little food and sleeping on the hard ground.  Gandhari did the same. They hid this from Yudhishthira because they didn't want to upset him.

After a long time, Dhritarashtra confided in Yudhishthira. He told Yudhishthira how heartbroken he was. He said he wanted to leave the kingdom and live a simple life in the forest, far away from everyone. He wanted to make amends for his mistakes.

Yudhishthira was shocked and heartbroken to hear of his uncle's suffering.  He felt terrible that he hadn't known.  He said he didn’t want the kingdom if it meant his uncle was unhappy.  He offered to let Dhritarashtra's son, Yuyutsu, become king instead.  He promised to follow Dhritarashtra to the forest.

Dhritarashtra was so weak from his fasting that he fainted while talking to Yudhishthira. Yudhishthira gently revived him with cool water and a comforting touch.

Dhritarashtra asked Yudhishthira for permission to go into the forest.  Yudhishthira, full of sadness, agreed.  He couldn't bear to see his uncle so unwell. Everyone cried—Vidura, Kripa, Kunti, and all the other queens.  Dhritarashtra, with Gandhari by his side, prepared to start their new simple life in the forest, leaving the kingdom to Yudhishthira.  They were finally ready to find peace.
