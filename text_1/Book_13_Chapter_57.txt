After the big war, Yudhishthira felt very sad.  He had won, but so many kings and people died.  He felt terrible about all the fighting and killing. He missed his friends and family who were on the other side.  He told his wise grandfather, Bhishma, "I feel awful! What will happen to me now?"

Bhishma, who was very wise and old, smiled kindly. He said, "Yudhishthira, there are many ways to be good and happy.  Good deeds bring good things. Doing good things is like planting seeds. The seeds grow into good things later on."

Bhishma explained:

"If you're kind and help others, you will be happy. If you give things away, you will get more good things.  If you are always truthful, you'll become friends with the gods! If you pray and do good things,  you can live a long and healthy life. If you only eat fruits and vegetables, you might even become a king!"

Bhishma told Yudhishthira about many other good things people could do. He said giving away cows, food, clothes, and even a house to people in need would bring you good luck and happiness. Even giving away a beautiful daughter in marriage to a kind man would bring good things to the family.

Bhishma also said that a brave warrior who died in battle goes to a very special place after they die.  He said there's no better place to go.

Yudhishthira listened carefully. He felt much better after hearing Bhishma's kind words.  He decided to focus on doing good things instead of being sad about the past. He told his brothers and Draupadi, "Let's all follow Grandfather Bhishma's advice.  Let's make the world a better place.‚Äù  Everyone agreed, and they all felt happy.
