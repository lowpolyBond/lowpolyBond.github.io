King Yudhishthira asked Bhishma, his wise uncle, a question.  "Uncle," he said, "you've told me about different ways to live and what kings should do. You've told lots of stories.  But I have one question. What happens to people who quietly say sacred words, mantras, all day long? Where do they go after they die?"

Bhishma smiled. "That's a good question," he said. "It reminds me of a story about Yama, the god of death, and a wise Brahman.  There are two main ways to become wise, Sankhya and Yoga.  Both can involve quietly saying mantras. But it's not just about the words."

"Think of it like this," Bhishma explained. "It’s about being calm and quiet.  It’s about controlling your feelings, being kind, and not wanting things. It’s about spending time alone, thinking peaceful thoughts. It's about being good and helpful to others."

"These people are like meditating," Bhishma continued. "They sit quietly, often on special grass, and think about God. They say the Gayatri prayer, a very special prayer, then stop even that, focusing only on their peaceful thoughts. Because they're so peaceful, they're no longer sad or angry. They don't worry about what others think. They don't want things. They don't think of themselves as doing things or getting things.  Their work is just being peaceful."

"Eventually," Bhishma said, "they become so peaceful that they let go of their bodies and become one with God.  They go to a beautiful place, the region of Brahma, and never have to be reborn again. They are free, peaceful, and happy forever."
