Once upon a time, Queen Draupadi, also called Krishna, talked to King Yudhishthira.  She said some things that made Yudhishthira think she didn't believe in God.

Yudhishthira said, "Draupadi, you talk very nicely, but your words sound like you don't believe in good deeds.  I do good things because it's the right thing to do, not to get a reward. I give gifts because I should, and I pray because I should. I try my best to be a good king and husband, whether or not I get something in return."

He explained, "Being good isn't like trading.  A good person doesn't do good just to get something back.  It's like my heart naturally wants to do good things, just like how a flower naturally blooms."  

Yudhishthira went on, "The wisest people, like the great saint Markandeya, who lives forever because he's so good, and wise men like Vyasa and Narada, they all show us that being good is important. They're so powerful because they're good!  The ancient books, the Vedas, tell us the same thing.  If you doubt being good, you'll be reborn as an animal!"

"Doubt about goodness is very bad," he continued. "It's like a child from a good family who studies hard and acts good—everyone sees them as wise, even if they are young.  But someone who's bad and doubts goodness is worse than anyone.  Goodness is like a life raft that helps you reach heaven, like a ship takes sailors across the ocean."

"If good things didn't have good results," Yudhishthira said, "the world would be dark and terrible.  Nobody would be good, nobody would learn, and everyone would live like animals. Gods, wise people, and even powerful beings like Rakshasas all know this is true. They are good because they know being good brings good things."

"Think about your own birth, and how Dhrishtadyumna was born," he reminded her. "These are proof that good things happen to good people! People who control their minds are happy, even if they don't have much.  Foolish people are never happy because they don't understand that being good is the best reward. Even the gods don't fully understand how good and bad actions work, but the very best people, who are very holy, do."

"So, Draupadi, don't doubt God or goodness," Yudhishthira said kindly. "Keep doing good things—give gifts, pray, and always remember God.  Never forget that God's kindness gives us a chance at a good life, even immortality.  Believe in goodness, my dear queen, and your doubts will disappear like morning mist!"
