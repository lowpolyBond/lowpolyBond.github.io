King Dhritarashtra's grandfather, Bhishma, was a very wise old man.  He talked to Karna, a brave warrior who was a friend of Duryodhana, the Kaurava prince.

Bhishma said, "Karna, you are like the sun to the stars, the ocean to the rivers!  You protect your friends and family. You're strong and defeat your enemies.  You are like a hero from the stories! You've already won many battles! You defeated the Kamvojas, the Nagnajit, and many other kings and warriors. You even made the fierce Kiratas obey Duryodhana.  You helped Duryodhana so much!"

Bhishma continued, "Karna, you are like a son to us, just like Duryodhana. Be a strong leader for the Kauravas!  Fight bravely!  Lead them to victory!"

Karna bowed to Bhishma and went to the Kaurava army. He saw the huge army, all ready for battle. He cheered them on and made them feel strong and brave.  The Kauravas were so happy to see Karna! They cheered loudly, beat their chests, and noisily showed off their bows and arrows. Everyone was excited to fight with Karna by their side!
