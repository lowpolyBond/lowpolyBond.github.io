King Duryodhana asked his grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandpa, how did Shikhandi, who was born a girl, become a man?"

Bhishma smiled. "Well, Duryodhana," he began, "King Drupada and his queen really wanted a son.  They prayed to the great god Shiva for a strong boy who could help them.  But Shiva said, 'You'll have a child who'll be both a girl and a boy!'"

King Drupada was surprised, but he and the queen still hoped for a son.  When their baby was born, she was a girl! But King Drupada and his wife decided to keep a secret.  They pretended the girl was a boy!

They gave her a boy's name, Shikhandi, and raised her like a son.  They did everything for her that they would do for a boy. Only a few people knew the truth. Even Shikhandi didn't know she was a girl.  Only Bhishma, through his spies and a wise man named Narada, knew the secret.  And so, Shikhandi grew up believing she was a prince. Later, something amazing happened, but that's another story!"
