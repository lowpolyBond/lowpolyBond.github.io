Once upon a time, a wise old man named Vasishtha was very sad. His sons were gone, and he missed them terribly.  He wandered and wandered, feeling lost and alone.

He came to a big, rushing river.  It was so strong, it knocked down trees!  Vasishtha was scared of drowning. He tied himself up with ropes and jumped in! But the river was too powerful. It broke the ropes and pushed him to the shore. Because the river broke his ropes, he named it Vipasa, which means "rope-breaker."

Vasishtha still felt sad. He kept wandering. He found another scary river, full of crocodiles! He jumped in again!  But the river thought he was fire and scattered in a hundred different directions!  He called this river Satadru, the "hundred-streamed river."

Vasishtha still couldn't find peace. He decided to go back home.  As he walked, he heard someone singing beautiful songs from the Vedas (holy books). It was his daughter-in-law, Adrisyanti. She was pregnant with his grandson!  This made Vasishtha happy. He wasn't alone after all!  He went home with Adrisyanti.

One day, a scary-looking king named Kalmashapada appeared. He was angry and wanted to hurt Vasishtha. Adrisyanti was very scared. But Vasishtha was brave. He used a magic sound and holy water to help the king.  

The king was actually under a spell. Vasishtha broke the spell! The king was very grateful. He was a good king, but he had made a mistake. He asked Vasishtha for help to have a son.

Vasishtha agreed to help. He went with the king to his beautiful city, Ayodhya.  Everyone was so happy to see their king!  Vasishtha helped the queen have a baby. It took a long time, but finally, a strong and brave baby boy named Asmaka was born! He grew up to be a great king.  And Vasishtha? He finally found peace.
