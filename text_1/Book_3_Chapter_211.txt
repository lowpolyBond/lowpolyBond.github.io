Once upon a time, in a faraway land, a wise man named Markandeya was talking to a priest.  They were talking about three special qualities: sattwa, rajas, and tamas.  It was like learning about three different colors that make up everything!

A bird catcher joined their chat. The priest asked him, "Bird catcher, can you explain these three qualities?"

The bird catcher said, "Sure!  Tamas is like being sleepy and confused.  Someone under the influence of tamas is lazy, grumpy, and doesn't think clearly. They might daydream a lot."

"Rajas is like being energetic and wanting things," the bird catcher continued. "Someone with a lot of rajas works hard to get what they want. They might be a bit ambitious and sometimes a little impatient."

"But sattwa is the best!" he exclaimed. "Sattwa is about being calm, kind, and wise. People with sattwa are patient, understanding, and don't get angry easily.  They do things without wanting a reward."

The bird catcher explained that even if someone starts with lots of tamas, they can change. If someone works hard and learns to be kind, they can become more like sattwa.  He said, "It doesn't matter what family you're born into. If you are good and kind, you can become a better person, no matter where you start."

The priest smiled.  He learned a lot from the bird catcher that day.  The bird catcher was wiser than he looked!
