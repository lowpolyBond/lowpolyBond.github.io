Garuda, a magical bird, told a story about the west.  He said it was Varuna's favorite place. Varuna is the king of the ocean!  He lives there because that's where the sun sets every day.  That's why it's called the west.

A long, long time ago, powerful wind spirits blew some bad guys, the Daityas, into the west.  They were so tired from the storm, they fell asleep and never woke up!

The west is also home to a big mountain called Asta. The sun seems to hug this mountain as it sets.  At night, sleep comes from the west, too!

Once, a powerful god named Indra cut a baby in the west into many pieces. Those pieces turned into wind spirits called Maruts!

The roots of a huge mountain, Himavat, stretch far under the ocean in the west.  You couldn't even walk to the end in a thousand years!

A magical cow, Surabhi, pours her milk near a beautiful lake in the west.  And guess what?  A scary, headless snake named Rahu tries to eat the sun and moon there!

A strong, green-haired giant named Suvarnasiras chants prayers loudly in the west.  And a princess is stuck in the sky there, because the sun told her to stop!

The west is special because the wind, fire, water, and earth are always happy there.  The sun changes its path in the west, and all the stars go into the sun before going with the moon.  All the rivers that fill the ocean start in the west.  Even Varuna's palace, Vishnu's home, and a big snake prince named Anarta all live in the west!  Even Kasyapa, a wise old man, lives there!

Garuda finished his story and asked, "Now, where shall we go?"
