Once upon a time, after a big battle, Bhima, a strong warrior with eyes like lotus flowers, was very sad. His sons had been killed. He wanted revenge, so he went to fight alone.  He wanted to fight Ashwatthama, Drona's son.

Yudhishthira, Bhima's brother, was worried.  "Bhima is my dearest brother," he said. "He's in great danger! Ashwatthama has a super-powerful weapon, the Brahmashira. It's so strong, it could destroy the whole world!"

Drona, a wise teacher, had given this weapon to Ashwatthama. But he told Ashwatthama, "Never use this weapon, especially not against people!"  Ashwatthama was very upset. He felt unlucky, so he went to live in a faraway city called Dvaraka.

One day, Ashwatthama went to see Krishna, a very powerful warrior.  He asked Krishna, "Give me your special discus! It can kill anyone. I'll give you my Brahmashira weapon in exchange."

Krishna smiled. "I have many powerful weapons," he said. "You can choose one. But first, try to lift my discus."

Ashwatthama tried with all his might, but he couldn't even move it!  He was sad.  Krishna then said, "My friend Arjuna, who is even stronger than you, never asked me for such a powerful weapon. My son, Pradyumna, never asked either. Why do you want it?"

Ashwatthama admitted, "I wanted to use it to fight you, Krishna!  Then I'd be unbeatable!"  He was disappointed, so he left.

Krishna warned everyone, "Ashwatthama is angry and dangerous! He knows how to use that powerful Brahmashira weapon. We need to protect Bhima!"
