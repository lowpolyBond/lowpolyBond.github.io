Once upon a time, there was a wise boy named Suka.  He was the son of a very famous sage, Vyasa. Suka wanted to learn super special powers, like flying!

Suka climbed a tall mountain. He found a quiet, grassy spot.  He sat down and closed his eyes. He did special breathing exercises, just like in his yoga lessons. He started from his toes and went all the way up to his head.  He did this until the sun came up.  

When the sun rose, Suka sat facing the east.  It was very peaceful.  He saw his own soul, free and happy! He smiled so big he laughed!

Suka kept practicing his yoga. He became so good, he could fly! He zoomed around and went to see a wise, old man named Narada. Narada was really impressed!  Suka said, "I can fly now! I learned how to be free!"

Narada gave Suka permission to fly even higher. Suka flew up, up, up! He flew so high he was above the clouds!  He flew so fast, it was like the wind!

Everyone saw Suka flying. Birds, animals, and even people in the sky watched him. They were amazed!  Angels and fairies showered him with beautiful flowers.  Everyone wondered, "Who is this amazing boy?"

Suka flew all over the world. He saw everything: mountains, oceans, forests, and even other magical creatures!  They all bowed down to him because he was so good and kind.

Then Suka saw two beautiful fairies named Urvasi and Purvachitti. They were amazed by his flying skills. They said, "You are so wonderful!  But why did your father send you away?"  

Suka felt sad, but he loved his father very much.  He told everyone, "If my father calls for me, please tell him I'm okay!"  And guess what?  The whole world answered, "We will tell your father you're okay!"  

Suka's amazing journey showed everyone how powerful kindness and hard work can be. He showed that even a young boy can achieve amazing things with dedication and practice.
