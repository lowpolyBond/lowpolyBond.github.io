Once upon a time, after the armies were all lined up for a big battle, King Dhritarashtra was very worried.  He asked his friend Sanjaya, "Sanjaya, tell me everything that's happening!  My son Duryodhana is so stubborn and mean. He loves to cheat and fight.  Even though I know this war will be terrible, I can't stop him! I see what's wrong, but I can't make him listen.  I guess whatever will happen, will happen.  A warrior should bravely fight, even if it means losing his life."

Sanjaya said, "King, you're right to worry. But don't blame just Duryodhana.  If someone does bad things, they can't blame fate or the gods.  The Pandavas were cheated, but they patiently waited, hoping you would help.  Soon, there will be a terrible battle!  Many brave soldiers, horses and elephants will die.  This makes us think: are we really in charge of what we do?  Some say everything is decided by God. Some say it's our own choices. And some say it's what happened in our past lives. Listen carefully to what happened next."
