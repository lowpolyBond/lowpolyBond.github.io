Once upon a time, King Yudhishthira asked a wise man named Markandeya a question.  He wanted to know why a great king named Kuvalaswa changed his name to Dhundhumara. Markandeya said, "I'll tell you a story!"

Long ago, a very holy man named Utanka lived in a beautiful forest. He prayed to Lord Vishnu for many, many years.  Finally, Lord Vishnu appeared! Utanka was so happy, he praised Vishnu, saying, "You are amazing! You made everything – the sun, the moon, the stars, even me!"

Vishnu was pleased.  "You've been very good," he said. "Ask for a gift!"

Utanka just smiled. "I'm already so happy to see you, that's the best gift!"

Vishnu insisted, "Please, ask for something!"

Utanka said, "Just let me always be good, truthful, and happy, and always remember you."

Vishnu agreed. He also told Utanka, "A very bad demon named Dhundhu wants to destroy the world!  A brave king from the Ikshvaku family will be born.  His name will be Kuvalaswa, and *he* will defeat Dhundhu! You will help him."  Then Vishnu disappeared.

And that, my friends, is why King Kuvalaswa became known as Dhundhumara – because he defeated the terrible demon Dhundhu! He became famous for his bravery and because of the help of the holy man, Utanka.
