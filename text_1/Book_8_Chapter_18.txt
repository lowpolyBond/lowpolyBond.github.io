A great battle was raging!  On one side fought the Pandavas.  On the other, their enemies.

Suddenly, a terrible roar came from the north.  Dandadhara, a powerful warrior riding a giant elephant, was smashing the Pandava army!  He was crushing soldiers, chariots, and elephants – everything in his path!

Krishna, Arjuna's friend and charioteer, saw Dandadhara.  "Arjuna," he said, "that's Dandadhara, a very strong warrior!  He's even stronger than Bhagadatta!  We must defeat him first!"

Krishna quickly drove the chariot towards Dandadhara.  The elephant was HUGE! It trumpeted like a storm cloud and its tusks were sharp. It trampled everything under its feet.  It was like a giant monster!

Arjuna, a brave warrior, charged towards Dandadhara.  Dandadhara threw many arrows at Arjuna and Krishna, and even at their horses! He laughed loudly.

But Arjuna was clever and strong! With swift arrows, he cut down Dandadhara's bow and flag. Then he cut the ropes holding Dandadhara's elephant driver, so the driver fell.  Dandadhara got very angry.

He used his elephant to attack Arjuna again. But Arjuna was too fast! With sharp arrows, he cut off Dandadhara's arms, then his head! The huge elephant fell to the ground, roaring in pain.

Dandadhara's brother, Danda, rushed in on another huge elephant, even bigger and stronger!  He also attacked Arjuna and Krishna.  But Arjuna was unstoppable. He quickly cut off Danda's arms and head too!  The second giant elephant fell.

Seeing their leaders fall, the enemy army got scared. They started fighting amongst themselves, falling and running away in fear.

Arjuna’s friends cheered. They were so happy that Arjuna had saved them from the fearsome elephants and warriors.  Arjuna was pleased, and then he went to fight the next group of enemies.  The battle was far from over!
