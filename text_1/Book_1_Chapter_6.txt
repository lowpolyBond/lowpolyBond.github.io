Once upon a time, a beautiful woman named Pauloma lived with her husband, a very powerful wise man named Bhrigu.  A mean monster, a Rakshasa, wanted to take her away.  The fire god, Agni, told the Rakshasa where Pauloma was.

The Rakshasa grabbed Pauloma and ran super fast!  But Pauloma’s baby, still inside her tummy, was very angry.  The baby, who would later be called Chyavana, popped out of his mother’s tummy! He was so bright, like the sun!

The Rakshasa was scared by the shining baby. He dropped Pauloma and turned to ash!  Pauloma was very sad but held her baby tight.  As she cried, her tears made a big river!  The great god Brahma gave the river a name: Vadhusara. It flowed near where Chyavana would grow up.

Bhrigu, Pauloma’s husband, was very angry.  He asked Pauloma, “Who told the Rakshasa about you?”  Pauloma said, “The fire god, Agni!”

Bhrigu was furious! He shouted a magic curse at Agni: “You will have to eat everything!”  And that’s how Agni, the fire god, got cursed to always need fuel to burn.  That’s the end of the story of how Chyavana was born and how Agni got his curse.
