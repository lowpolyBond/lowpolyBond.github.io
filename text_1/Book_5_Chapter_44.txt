King Dhritarashtra asked a wise man named Sanat-sujata, "Tell me about Brahman, the source of everything!"

Sanat-sujata said, "Brahman isn't easy to find. You need to calm your mind and focus.  Then you'll understand. This understanding comes from learning and living a good life."

Dhritarashtra asked, "Brahman is inside us, you say.  How does knowing about it make us immortal?"

Sanat-sujata answered, "Brahman is always within, but hidden.  A good life and focusing your mind makes it clear.  Those who understand Brahman leave the world behind."

Dhritarashtra wondered, "How do we find Brahman easily?  What's the best way to learn?"

Sanat-sujata explained, "Live with a wise teacher. Be kind and helpful.  Learn everything you can. Don't be angry.  Serve your teacher with your whole heart, even doing the small jobs. Treat your teacher's family like your own family. Be thankful for their kindness. Always be honest. Never leave your teacher without their permission.   Learn from your teacher's words, your own thinking, and talking with others. This good life, this learning, is the path to Brahman. By following this path, even kings and gods become better, stronger, and more beautiful! This path makes you happy, healthy, and wise. This leads to immortality. It's the only way to true freedom."

Dhritarashtra then asked, "What does Brahman look like? Is it red, blue, or white?"

Sanat-sujata replied, "Brahman can seem to be any color. But Brahman is not in the sky, the ocean, or the stars. It's not found in books or prayers.  It's everywhere and nowhere at once! It's bigger than mountains, tinier than a razor's edge. It's the foundation of everything. It's unchanging. Everything comes from Brahman, and everything returns to it. It's the all-knowing, all-powerful, all-seeing power."
