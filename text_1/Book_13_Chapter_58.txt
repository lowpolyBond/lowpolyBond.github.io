King Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandpa, what good things happen if we dig ponds and plant trees?"

Bhishma smiled. "My dear boy, digging a pond is wonderful! Imagine a beautiful place, full of plants and animals.  A pond makes that place even better. It helps everyone – people, animals, even birds!  It's like having a friendly house full of water.  The sun god loves it, and the gods are happy too.  It makes you famous and brings you good things: happiness, wealth, and doing what's right.  A pond in a nice place is best.  People, animals, magical creatures, and even tiny insects all use it.

Digging a pond is like giving a really big gift.  If your pond has water in the rainy season, it's like doing a special prayer.  If it has water in the autumn, it's like giving away a thousand cows!  Water in winter is like giving lots of gold.  Spring water is like a huge party, and summer water is like a super-big celebration!  If animals drink from your pond, you save your whole family!  It’s like sharing the best drink ever!  Water is special, even after we die. It brings happiness forever.  So give the gift of water.

Now, about trees…  There are so many kinds! Planting them is amazing. It makes you famous, and everyone in heaven loves you. Your family will also be safe and loved for years to come. Trees are like your children. They take you to heaven when you die. They give flowers to make the gods happy, fruits for the spirits, and shade for everyone.  All kinds of creatures use trees for shade and homes. Planting trees is really good!

So, Yudhishthira, dig ponds, plant trees, and always tell the truth. That’s the best way to be happy now and forever!"
