Once upon a time, Princess Draupadi had to hide her true identity.  She tied up her long, beautiful black hair and wore a simple, old, dark dress. She pretended to be a servant girl, someone who helps others around the house.  

She walked around the city looking sad, hoping someone would help her.  People asked her who she was, and she said, "I'm a servant. I need a job."  But everyone was amazed by her beauty! They couldn't believe she was just a servant.

Queen Sudeshna saw Draupadi.  She was amazed at how beautiful Draupadi was!  The Queen asked, "Who are you, beautiful girl?" Draupadi answered, "I am a servant girl."

But Queen Sudeshna didn't believe her.  She said, "You're too beautiful to be a servant! You look like a princess!"  She went on and on about how pretty Draupadi was—her hair, her eyes, her smile, everything was perfect! She wondered if Draupadi was a magical being, like a fairy or a goddess.

Draupadi explained, "I'm not a fairy or a goddess. I'm really just a servant. I know how to do many things around a house—make pretty flower garlands, make nice-smelling oils, and more. I even worked for another queen before!"

Queen Sudeshna worried that King Virata would fall in love with Draupadi. But Draupadi said, "Don't worry!  Five magical men protect me.  No one can hurt me!" She said that these men would only allow her to work for people who treated her kindly.

Queen Sudeshna was relieved. She hired Draupadi and promised to treat her well.  Draupadi went to live in the palace. Nobody knew her true identity!  She was very good at her job, and everyone liked her.
