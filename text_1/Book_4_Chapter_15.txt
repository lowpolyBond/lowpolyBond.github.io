Once upon a time, a very bad man named Kichaka wanted Draupadi, a beautiful princess who was hiding in disguise.  He was so rude and mean! He begged the Queen, Sudeshna, to help him get Draupadi.

Sudeshna felt sorry for Kichaka, but she also worried about Draupadi. She thought of a clever plan.  "Kichaka," she said, "have a big feast. Then, I'll send Draupadi to get some wine."  She hoped this would give Kichaka a chance to be with Draupadi without being too forceful.

Kichaka was very happy! He made a wonderful feast with lots of delicious food and drinks.  Then, Sudeshna asked Draupadi to get some wine from Kichakaâ€™s place.

But Draupadi was scared! She knew Kichaka was a terrible man.  "I can't go!" she said. "He will be mean to me."

Sudeshna said, "Don't worry, he won't hurt you if I send you."

Draupadi was still afraid, but she went anyway. She was very worried and prayed to the sun god, Surya, for help. Surya, seeing her fear, sent a magical protector to keep Draupadi safe.

When Kichaka saw Draupadi, he was very excited. But before he could do anything, he saw the magical protector! He was very scared and ran away.  Draupadi returned safely, thanks to her prayers and the magical protector!
