King Dhritarashtra asked his advisor, Sanjaya, "Sanjaya, tell me what Arjuna's mighty half-brother did in the battle after Iravat the elephant was killed!"

Sanjaya said, "When Iravat died, Ghatotkacha, Bhima's son, roared so loud the earth shook!  Mountains and forests trembled.  The sky trembled too.  The soldiers were scared. They were so afraid, they just stood still like elephants afraid of a lion!

Ghatotkacha roared like thunder.  He looked scary and strong, with a big spear. He had lots of strong Rakshasa friends with him. He charged towards the enemy, angry and powerful.

Seeing his soldiers running away, Duryodhana, the Kaurava prince, attacked Ghatotkacha.  He roared like a lion and shot arrows. Ten thousand HUGE elephants, like moving mountains, followed him.

Ghatotkacha was even angrier now! A super-duper scary battle started.  The Rakshasas attacked the elephants with swords, spears, and arrows.  Many elephants were hurt. Some were bleeding, some had broken legs.

When many elephants were dead, Duryodhana fought the Rakshasas bravely. He was fearless and shot many arrows, killing many Rakshasas.  He even killed four important ones!

But Ghatotkacha got even angrier! He pulled his giant bow and charged at Duryodhana. Duryodhana didn't run.  Ghatotkacha shouted, "Today, I will get revenge!  You cheated my family! You treated my aunt, Draupadi, very badly!  I will fight you!"

Ghatotkacha pulled his bow and shot so many arrows at Duryodhana, it was like a huge rain storm!"
