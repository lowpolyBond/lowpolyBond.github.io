Once upon a time, a snake named Astika lived with his mother, Jaratkaru.  Jaratkaru told Astika, "Son, it's time to do what we were meant to do."

Astika asked, "Why were you given to my father, Mom?"

Jaratkaru explained, "My brother, King Vasuki, needed our help.  Our grandmother, Kadru, was angry. She cursed all the snakes because they wouldn't lie about a magical horse.  She said, 'Because you wouldn't lie, King Janamejaya will burn you all in a big fire sacrifice!'  Even the great god Brahma agreed with her curse!"

Vasuki, the snake king, was very scared. He and the other gods asked Brahma to help. Brahma said, "Jaratkaru will have a son, a wise Brahmin, who will save the snakes."  That son was Astika!  Jaratkaru said, "Astika, you must save your uncle Vasuki from the fire!"

Astika said, "I will!" He went to see King Janamejaya, who was doing the sacrifice.  The guards wouldn't let him in, but Astika was kind and they let him pass.  Astika went to the big fire, ready to save the snakes.  Vasuki was very worried, but Astika promised, "Don't worry, Uncle! I'll stop the fire!"
