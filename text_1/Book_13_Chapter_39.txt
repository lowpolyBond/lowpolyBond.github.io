King Yudhishthira was puzzled.  He said, "King, men and women always seem drawn to each other.  It's like magic!  But why do men like women, even when women sometimes make mistakes? And why do women like some men and not others? How can men keep women safe and happy?"

He thought about it hard.  "Women are very clever," he said. "They can be like sneaky tricksters! They can act happy even when they are not.  They can make lies sound true and truths sound like lies! They're even smarter than the smartest teachers and advisors!  They can change a man's mind easily, whether he is nice to them or not! If men are happy, women seem happy. If men are sad, women seem sad. It's like they can mirror their feelings.  How can anyone control someone so clever?"

Yudhishthira was confused. He knew that animals usually behave well. But women, even when treated kindly, sometimes don't.  "It seems impossible to make women always do what is right," he worried.  "Can anyone really control them?  Can they be taught to always be good?"  He looked at the king and asked, "Please, tell me the answer to this great puzzle!"
