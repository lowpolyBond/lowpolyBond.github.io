Once upon a time, the wise Bhishma told a story about understanding the world. He said, "To truly understand the big, powerful Brahma, you need to understand four things: dreams, sleeping without dreams, Brahma as we see him, and Brahma beyond anything we can see."

He explained that everything we can see, like our bodies, will die. But something inside us, our soul, is always there. This is like a special secret.  Narayana, a great wise man, taught us about the world we live in – a world of growing and changing things. But another way is to understand the soul, which is always there. This leads to understanding the real Brahma.

Brahma, the creator, made the world of growing and changing. This world means we are reborn again and again. But the other way, understanding the soul, leads to the highest goal.  People who try really hard to understand what is good and bad, and study their souls, reach that high goal.

Bhishma said, "To reach this goal, you need to understand two things:  the soul, and the energy that makes the world." There's something even bigger than both of these, something beyond everything. Smart people try to understand this.

The soul and the world's energy are always there. They are eternal and powerful.  But they are different. The world's energy has three parts: good, bad, and darkness. It is always creating things. The soul is different; it observes everything but isn't affected by it.  Both the soul and the biggest thing are hard to understand. They are beyond description.

Think of a person wearing a turban, Bhishma said. The turban is made of cloth, but the person is not the turban.  Similarly, we have good, bad, and darkness inside us, but we are not those things. We are something more.  Understanding these four things is very important.

If you understand all this, you won't be confused. To be happy, be pure in your heart, and practice being good. Do yoga, not to get rewards, but just to do it. The universe is full of yoga's power.  The sun and moon in the sky are like the light of yoga in our hearts.  Yoga brings knowledge.

Yoga means getting rid of bad feelings and darkness.  Good actions and kind words are part of yoga. Eating simple food that you receive as a gift is important. This helps to be calm and focused. Use your mind to gain understanding.  Even as you die, hold onto that understanding.

When we die, our body goes away, then a subtle part of us may stay a while. But when we let go of all our attachments, we become part of the world's energy. To truly become one with Brahma, we must get past even that.

Birth and death come from not understanding Brahma. When we understand Brahma, we don't fear death. People who don't understand are always caught in the cycle of birth and death.

Some people meditate to become closer to understanding. Others worship Brahma in images or in their minds. They all try to reach the same highest goal.

Those who know the truth become free from the world and closer to Brahma. They become like Brahma – unchanging and free from death. They live happily ever after. The world only exists for those who are confused. For those who understand, the world's cycle of desire is like a spinning wheel.  Desire is everywhere. But those who understand the world's energy, the soul, and the highest truth are free from desire.

Narayana, the wise and kind one, showed everyone how to live forever.
