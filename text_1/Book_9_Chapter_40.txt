Once upon a time, a long, long time ago, there was a student named Arshtishena. He studied very hard, but he couldn't learn anything!  He felt very sad. So, he decided to do something amazing. He did very, very hard penance – that means he prayed and practiced very hard for a long, long time.  Because of his hard work, he became super smart and learned everything! He was so happy! He made a special place where people could pray and be safe from animals and snakes.  He helped everyone there.

In the same place, two other people named Sindhudwipa and Devapi also became very wise and learned.

Then there was a brave king named Vishvamitra. His father was a king too, but he wanted to become a wise man.  He left the kingdom to his son, Vishvamitra. Vishvamitra tried to be a good king, but it was very hard.  He went to visit a wise man's home.  Vishvamitra's army made a mess! The wise man was very angry. He made scary creatures attack Vishvamitra’s soldiers! They ran away!

Vishvamitra felt ashamed. He decided to do hard penance just like Arshtishena. He ate very little, slept on the ground, and prayed very hard. The gods tried to stop him, but he didn’t give up! Finally, he worked so hard that he became a very wise and learned man.  He became a Brahmana, someone who was very wise and holy.  He helped many people, just like Arshtishena. He even gave away lots of gifts. Then he went to another place to pray.  And that's how these wonderful people became so wise and helpful!
