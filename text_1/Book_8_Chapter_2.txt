After Karna died, Sanjaya, a fast horse rider, raced to Hastinapura that night.  He found King Dhritarashtra very sad.  His family and friends were gone.

Sanjaya bowed before the king.  "King," he said sadly, "Are you alright?  Vidura, Krishna, and others warned you.  They gave you good advice, but you didn't listen.  You lost Bhishma, Drona, and so many others!"

King Dhritarashtra sighed. "Sanjaya," he said, "My heart hurts!  My strong warriors, Bhishma and Drona, are dead.  Drona, who was so skilled with his bow and arrow, was killed!  Even Karna, the greatest warrior, is gone!  When Drona died, our army fell apart. They ran away like scared mice!"

The king asked Sanjaya about what happened to his other sons, and his friends, Karna, Kritavarma, and Shalya.  He wanted to know how brave the Pandavas were.

Sanjaya said, "King, this is what fate decided.  Wise people don't worry about what fate brings. We can't control everything."

Dhritarashtra said, "You're right, Sanjaya. It was fate. Now tell me everything that happened."
