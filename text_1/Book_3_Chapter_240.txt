Once upon a time, the great warrior Karna lost a big battle.  He was defeated by magical Gandharva warriors!  Because of this, Karna's whole army ran away!

Duryodhana, the prince, didn't run. He bravely fought the Gandharvas. He shot lots of arrows, but the Gandharvas were too strong! They smashed his chariot to pieces!  They even hurt his horses and his driver.  Poor Duryodhana fell to the ground.  A strong Gandharva named Chitrasena caught him.  Duryodhana was a prisoner!

The Gandharvas also captured Duryodhana's brother, Dussasana, and some other important people. They even took all the royal ladies!

The scared soldiers of Duryodhanaâ€™s army ran to the Pandavas, who were nearby. They cried, "The Gandharvas have captured Duryodhana, Dussasana, and everyone! Please help!"

Bhima, one of the Pandavas, chuckled. He said, "The Gandharvas did what we should have done!  Duryodhana was mean, and this is his punishment.  He deserved this!"

But Yudhishthira, the kind Pandava king, stopped Bhima.  He said,  "Bhima, this isn't the time to be mean. We need to think about what to do next."

So, the Pandavas were left to decide what to do about their captured enemies.  The Gandharvas had done something quite unexpected and exciting!
