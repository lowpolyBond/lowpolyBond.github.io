King Yudhishthira was curious.  "How did Srinjaya's son become Suvarnashthivin?" he asked. "Why did Parvata give him the child? And why did the baby die so young? People lived for a thousand years back then!  Was Suvarnashthivin even a real baby?"

Krishna smiled. "Let me tell you a story," he said. "Two very wise holy men, Narada and Parvata, were like an uncle and nephew. They decided to visit Earth for a holiday. They promised each other they'd always tell each other their secrets, good or bad.  If they didn't, they'd be cursed!

They visited King Srinjaya.  The king was so happy to have them, he introduced his beautiful daughter, Sukumari.  She was kind and helped them.

Narada, the uncle, fell in love with Sukumari! He was too shy to tell Parvata, so Parvata got very angry. "You broke our promise!" he shouted.  "You didn't tell me about your feelings! I curse you!  You'll marry Sukumari, but everyone will see you as an ape!"

Narada was furious! He cursed Parvata back. "You'll never go to heaven!" he yelled.

They both said sorry later.  Narada married Sukumari, but she saw him as an ape!  She still loved him though.  She never looked at anyone else.

One day, Parvata found Narada.  He asked for Narada's help to go to heaven.  Narada said, "You cursed me first! But it wasn't fair, since you're like my son!" They both took back their curses.

When Sukumari saw Narada was no longer an ape, she almost ran away! Parvata told her it was still her husband.  Everything was alright. Parvata went to heaven, and Narada went home.  There's more to the story, and Narada himself is here to tell you about the baby and Suvarnashthivin!"
