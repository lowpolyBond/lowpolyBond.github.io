Bhishma, a wise old warrior, told the king, "The Pandavas have amazing warriors on their side! Draupadi's five sons are super-strong fighters.  Uttara, Virata's son, is also a great warrior.

Abhimanyu is the best of the best! He's as brave as Arjuna or Krishna. He's super-skilled with his weapons and never gives up. He'll fight hard to help his father's friends.

Satyaki is another incredible warrior. He's fearless and very angry when he fights! Uttamaujas and Yudhamanyu are also amazing warriors.

All these heroes have huge armies â€“ lots of chariots, elephants, and horses! They'll fight bravely for the Pandavas, because they're friends. They'll rush through your army like a wildfire!

King Virata and King Drupada are also super strong, even though they're older. They're true heroes, and they will fight their hardest for the Pandavas because they are friends.

All these warriors are amazing. They will fight so bravely, they don't even care if they die. They'll do anything to win the battle for their friends, the Pandavas. They'll fight with all their might and win!"
