Once upon a time, after a big battle, King Dhritarashtra, the father of the Kauravas (the bad guys), wanted to go live in the forest.  He sent his wise uncle, Vidura, to the Pandavas (the good guys) – Yudhishthira, Bhima, and Arjuna – to ask for some money.

Vidura explained that Dhritarashtra wanted to perform special ceremonies to remember all the people who had died, including his sons and even some of the Pandavas' enemies.  Yudhishthira and Arjuna were happy to help.

But Bhima was angry! He remembered all the bad things Dhritarashtra's son, Duryodhana, had done.  He didn't want to give Dhritarashtra any money.

Arjuna, who was very wise, tried to calm Bhima down.  "Bhima," he said, "our father is old and wants to honor those who died. He's asking for money that you won in the war. This is a chance to be kind, even to our enemies."  Arjuna pointed out that things had changed; the once powerful Dhritarashtra was now weak and needed help.  He asked Bhima to listen to Yudhishthira.

But Bhima wouldn't stop. "No!" he roared. "We should honor Bhishma, Drona, and all the others who died, but not Dhritarashtra's people.  They caused so much trouble!  Remember how we had to hide for thirteen years because of them? Where was Dhritarashtra's kindness then?" Bhima reminded Arjuna of their difficult life in hiding, how they suffered and Dhritarashtra did nothing to help.

Yudhishthira, the kind and wise king, heard Bhima's angry words.  He told Bhima to be quiet.  He knew it was important to be generous, even to their enemies, and to follow the right path.
