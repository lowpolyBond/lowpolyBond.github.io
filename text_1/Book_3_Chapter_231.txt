Once upon a time, in a beautiful forest, Draupadi and Satyabhama met.  They were both queens, very happy to see each other after a long time. They giggled and chatted about fun things.

Satyabhama, Krishna's wife, asked Draupadi a secret question. "Draupadi," she whispered, "how do you make the Pandava brothers, your husbands, listen to you? They're so strong and handsome!  Do you use magic spells or special potions?  Tell me your secret! I want Krishna to listen to me too!"

Draupadi smiled. "Oh, Satyabhama," she said, "that's not the way to make someone love and obey you.  Using magic or tricks is wrong. It only scares people. A husband shouldn't be afraid of his wife!"

Draupadi explained how she made her husbands happy.  "I always respect them," she said. "I don't get jealous or angry. I help them, and I care for their families. I'm always kind and polite, and I never do anything they don't like. I take care of our home, I make sure everyone is fed, and I’m always there to greet them when they return.”

Draupadi also talked about how she managed the huge palace.  She explained how she kept track of everything – the food, the servants, even the king's money! She worked very hard, day and night, to keep everyone happy and organized.

"I always put my husbands and family first," she said. "That’s how I make them happy. That's my magic!"

Satyabhama listened carefully. When Draupadi finished, Satyabhama bowed her head.  "Draupadi," she said, "I'm sorry. I asked a silly question.  It was just a joke between friends."  And that's how the two queens became even better friends.
