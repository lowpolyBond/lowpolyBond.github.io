The battle was raging!  Bhishma, a great warrior for the Kauravas (Duryodhana's side), was surrounded by the Pandavas (the good guys!). Duryodhana was worried.  He told his brother, Dussasana, "Bhishma is in danger! Protect him! He's our strongest fighter."

Dussasana gathered his army around Bhishma.  Sakuni, another Kaurava, sent his soldiers to attack Nakula, Sahadeva, and Yudhishthira, three of the Pandava brothers.  Duryodhana sent even more soldiers â€“ thousands of them!  They charged like eagles, making the ground shake!  Dust filled the air, blocking out the sun.

The Pandava brothers fought back bravely.  They were like a strong wall against a huge wave! They fought so well that many Kaurava soldiers fell.  Their horses ran away, scared. The Pandavas blew their horns and beat their drums, celebrating their victory.

Duryodhana was upset. He saw his soldiers losing. He called Salya, a strong warrior, and said, "The Pandavas are winning! Stop them!"

Salya charged towards Yudhishthira and his brothers.  A fierce fight began! Yudhishthira hit Salya with many arrows, and Nakula and Sahadeva hit him too.  Salya fought back, but the Pandavas were very strong.

Then Bhima, another powerful Pandava brother, rushed to help.  As the sun began to set, the battle became even more intense.
