Once upon a time, there was a powerful bird named Garuda. He was so strong, he could carry the whole Earth on one feather!  King Indra, the god of the sky, wanted to be friends with Garuda.

Indra said, "Garuda, your strength is amazing!  Let's be friends."

Garuda, who was very humble, said, "I can carry everything, even all the worlds! But I don't like to brag."  Garuda was carrying a special drink called Amrita, very important to the gods.  Indra asked Garuda to give him back the Amrita, but Garuda had a plan.

Garuda said, "I will put it down.  You can take it then, but I won't give it to anyone else." Indra agreed.

Garuda wanted to help his mom, who was trapped because of a trick played by some snakes. So, he promised to help the snakes, but then cleverly outsmart them.

He told the snakes, "I've got the Amrita! I'll put it on some grass.  You can drink it after you wash up."

While the snakes cleaned themselves, Indra quickly took the Amrita back to heaven! When the snakes came back, the Amrita was gone!  They licked the grass, and their tongues split into two!  The grass became special, too.

Garuda happily ate the snakes, and his mom was free!  Garuda was very happy, and everyone loved him.  The story tells us that listening to this story brings good luck!
