Long ago, there was a king named Dasaratha. He had four sons: Rama, Bharata, Lakshmana, and Shatrughna.  King Dasaratha promised Queen Kaikeyi, Bharata's mother, two special wishes.

When Rama grew up, Queen Kaikeyi used these wishes. One wish sent Rama to live in the forest for 14 years. The other wish made Bharata king.

Bharata was very sad. He went to see Rama in the forest.  He begged Rama to come back and be king.

Rama said, "Bharata, my father made a promise.  I must keep my promise and live in the forest.  You should be king. This will make my father proud and make Queen Kaikeyi happy."

Rama told Bharata a story about a king who went to heaven because his son was good.  He said having good sons helps everyone.

Rama told Bharata, "You are a good son. Be king, and take care of the people. I will be king of the forest animals.  Lakshmana will stay with me, and Shatrughna will stay with you. We will all make our father proud."

Bharata felt much better. He promised to be a good king.  He went back to the city, and Rama went deeper into the forest with Lakshmana and his wife, Sita.  They were sad to be apart, but they all knew they were doing what was right.
