Krishna, the strong warrior, was going to Hastinapura.  He had a big group with him! Ten brave warriors rode in chariots, a thousand soldiers marched on foot, a thousand rode horses, and hundreds more carried lots of food.

"What happened on his journey?" King Janamejaya asked.

Vaisampayana said, "Strange things happened!  Even though the sky was clear, there was thunder and lightning!  Fluffy clouds rained, even though it wasn't cloudy.  Big rivers flowed backward!  Fires started everywhere, and the ground shook. Wells and water pots overflowed.  It got very dark and dusty, you couldn't see anything!  Loud roars echoed, but no one knew where they came from!  A strong wind blew and knocked down lots of trees in Hastinapura, but where Krishna went, it was lovely.

Beautiful flowers rained down.  The path was smooth and clear.  Many priests welcomed him, giving him food and gifts.  Women threw sweet-smelling flowers at him.

Krishna reached a wonderful place called Salibhavana, full of crops. He saw many pretty villages buzzing with bees.  People from a town called Upaplavya came out to see him.  They were so happy to meet him and gave him a warm welcome.

Finally, Krishna reached Vrikasthala.  The sun looked red in the sky. Krishna stopped his chariot, prayed, and rested. His driver, Daruka, took care of the horses.

"We'll stay here tonight," Krishna said.  His people made a camp and cooked a delicious meal.  Kind priests from the village came to greet him. They offered him their homes, but Krishna politely said, "Thank you," and ate a happy meal with them before sleeping.
