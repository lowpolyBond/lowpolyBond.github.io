King Yudhisthira was very sad.  His family had been hurt, and he wanted to give up.  The wise Vyasa saw his sadness.  Vyasa told Yudhisthira a story to cheer him up.

This story was about King Janaka. King Janaka was also very sad. He asked a wise man named Asma, "What should I do when I lose my family and my riches?"

Asma said, "Happiness and sadness come to everyone.  When things are good, people get too proud.  They waste their money and then do bad things. When things are bad, they get even sadder. But remember, everyone gets old and dies, even great kings!  Rich or poor, strong or weak, everyone dies.  We can’t escape it."

Asma explained that good things and bad things happen because of destiny, like the seasons changing.  Sometimes people get sick, even doctors! Sometimes rich people become poor, and poor people live a long time. It’s all part of how the world works.  

Asma said,  “Don’t worry about things you can’t change.  Focus on good things: be kind, follow the rules, and worship the gods.” He said our time with family and friends is like a short stay at an inn – we'll move on.  Think about these things, and you'll feel better.

Asma also told Janaka, "You should do your duty as a king, be a good person, and enjoy life!"

King Janaka felt much better after hearing Asma’s wise words.  Vyasa said to Yudhisthira, "You are a great king, too! Don't be sad.  Be strong, like Janaka."  Yudhisthira felt hope again.
