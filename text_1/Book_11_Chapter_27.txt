The Pandavas and their wives went to the beautiful Ganges River.  The water was sparkling, and the riverbanks were wide and grassy.  The women took off their jewelry and fine clothes.  They were very sad.  They poured water into the river, remembering their fathers, brothers, sons, husbands, and friends who had died in the great war.

Then, Kunti, the Pandavas' mother, started to cry.  She told her sons, "Your oldest brother was Karna. He was a brave warrior, as strong as the sun! He fought bravely, even though he fought against you. He was my son, given to me by Surya, the sun god."

The Pandavas were shocked. They had never known.  Yudhishthira, their eldest brother, asked Kunti, "Mother, Karna was so powerful! He was like a roaring ocean, his chariot a huge lake, his arms like alligators! How could you keep this a secret?  Because of this secret, so many people died in the war!"

Yudhishthira felt terrible about Karna’s death. He was even sadder about Karna’s death than he was about the death of Abhimanyu or the sons of Draupadi. He cried and cried. Then, he poured water into the river to remember Karna, his long-lost brother. All the women cried with him.  Yudhishthira then asked for Karna’s family, and performed the water ceremony with them too.  He was very upset, and left the river feeling heartbroken.
