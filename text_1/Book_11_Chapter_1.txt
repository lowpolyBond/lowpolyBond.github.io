The Great War was over.  Many, many soldiers were dead.  King Dhritarashtra, Duryodhana's father, was very, very sad. He had lost all his sons! He was so heartbroken he couldn't even talk.

His wise advisor, Sanjaya, came to him.  "King," Sanjaya said, "being sad won't help.  So many soldiers died – even kings from faraway lands who fought for your son.  It’s time to take care of your family’s funeral."

Dhritarashtra was still very upset. He slumped to the ground like a tree that had fallen. "I've lost everything!" he cried.  "My sons, my friends, my kingdom... I'm like a bird without wings. I didn’t listen to good advice. Krishna, the wise man, told me to make peace and give a little land to the Pandavas. But I was foolish! I didn't listen to Bhishma, or Narada, or anyone who tried to help. Now, it's too late.  I must have done bad things in the past to deserve this."

Sanjaya tried to comfort him. "King," he said,  "you’ve heard wise words all your life.  You didn’t listen to good advice because you wanted power. Your son Duryodhana was proud and mean. He didn't listen to anyone, not even his own mother. He made enemies of everyone.  You were like a judge, but you weren't fair. You always sided with your son. Don't let sadness take over. It won't bring your sons back."

Sanjaya continued, "Think of it like this: someone who only looks for honey might fall and get hurt.  They regret being greedy.  Sadness is like that – it only hurts you more. It doesn't help. Don't cry for those you have lost; it won’t change anything. Your sadness is like fire, burning you even more. Use your wisdom and be strong."

Then, Vidura, another wise advisor, also spoke to the king, trying to help him feel better.
