King Nala and his queen, Damayanti, were very poor.  They were hungry and thirsty.  Nala didn't want to go back to his father's kingdom because he was ashamed of his failures. He was sad, and he didn't want to make Damayanti sadder.

They found a little shelter to rest.  They were so tired, they fell asleep on the ground, sharing one piece of clothing.  Nala woke up feeling terrible. He had lost everything â€“ his kingdom, his friends, even his nice clothes!

He thought, "Should I stay with Damayanti, making her sad too? Or should I leave her? Maybe she'll be better off without me."  A bad feeling, called Kali, made him think selfish thoughts.

Nala decided to leave Damayanti.  He felt awful about it. He even felt so bad that he wanted to cut their shared cloth in half so he had something to wear.  He snuck a sword from the shelter. He cut the cloth, leaving half for Damayanti.

He left her sleeping. But he couldn't go far. He came back again and again! He cried, looking at Damayanti sleeping alone and shivering.  He felt so guilty and sad.  He wished the gods would protect her. But finally, Kali's bad influence was too strong, and he left Damayanti alone in the forest.  He was very, very sad, but he went away.
