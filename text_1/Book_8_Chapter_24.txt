Nakula was bravely fighting the Kaurava army.  He was winning!  But then, Karna, a strong warrior, got angry and attacked Nakula.

Nakula smiled.  "Karna," he said, "It's been a long time! You're the cause of all this fighting.  I'll defeat you today!"

Karna, a prince and amazing archer, replied, "Fight me! Show me your strength!  Then you can boast."

The two warriors fought!  Karna shot 73 arrows at Nakula. Nakula fought back with 80 arrows!  Karna broke Nakula's bow with golden arrows.  Then Nakula got a new bow and shot 20 arrows at Karna, and 3 at Karna's driver.  He even broke Karna's bow again with a super-sharp arrow.  Nakula shot 300 more arrows at Karna!

Everyone watched in amazement.  Karna got a new bow and shot Nakula in the shoulder.  Nakula looked like the sun shining brightly even with arrows in him!  He broke another of Karna's bows!

Then, they both shot so many arrows, the sky was full of them! It looked like lots of fireflies or a swarm of locusts!  The arrows were so thick, you couldn't see the sun!

Karna's arrows killed many of Nakula's soldiers. Nakula's arrows killed many of Karna's soldiers.  Both armies stopped fighting to watch this amazing battle.

Karna, still angry, shot even more arrows at Nakula.  Nakula was completely surrounded by arrows, but he wasn't hurt!

Then, Karna broke Nakula's bow again.  He killed Nakula's driver and horses. He even destroyed Nakula's chariot!  Nakula had no chariot, no weapons, and no horses!

Nakula bravely fought back with a big club.  But Karna broke that too with his arrows.  Karna could have killed Nakula, but he didn't. Karna remembered a promise, and let Nakula go. He put his bow around Nakula's neck and told him to go home.

Nakula, very ashamed, went back to his brother.  Karna then attacked the Pancala army.  He fought so bravely that he destroyed many chariots, elephants, and soldiers!  It was a terrible battle, but Karna was very strong and won!
