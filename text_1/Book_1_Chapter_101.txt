King Santanu and his beautiful wife, Satyavati, got married.  Soon, they had a strong and brave son named Chitrangada.  He grew up to be a great warrior!

Then, Satyavati and Santanu had another son, Vichitravirya. He was also very strong and became a great archer.  He would be king someday.

But sadly, King Santanu got old and died.  Bhishma, Santanu's son from an earlier marriage, helped Chitrangada become king.

Chitrangada was so strong he could beat almost anyone!  Even a powerful king of the Gandharvas (magical beings) wanted to fight him.  They fought a huge battle for three whole years!  The Gandharva king was even trickier, and sadly, he won, defeating and killing Chitrangada.

Bhishma was very sad. He gave Chitrangada a proper burial.  Then, Bhishma helped young Vichitravirya become king.  Vichitravirya was still a boy, so Bhishma helped him rule the kingdom.  Vichitravirya listened to Bhishma, who was very wise and good.  They worked together, and the kingdom was safe and happy.
