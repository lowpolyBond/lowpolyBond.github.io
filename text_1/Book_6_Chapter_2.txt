Long ago, before a big battle, a wise man named Vyasa saw two armies getting ready to fight.  He felt sad because the armies were family â€“ the Kauravas and the Pandavas.  He went to King Dhritarashtra, who was blind and worried about his sons, the Kauravas.

Vyasa said, "King, your sons and the Pandavas will fight, and many will die. This is what must happen."  Dhritarashtra was very upset. He didn't want to *see* the battle, but he wanted to *know* what was happening.

Vyasa gave a special gift to his friend Sanjaya.  He said, "Sanjaya will tell you everything about the battle. He will see everything, even things hidden or happening at night.  Nothing will be secret from him."

Vyasa also told Dhritarashtra about scary signs he saw:  birds gathering, animals crying, strange things happening in the sky like the sun and moon looking different, and even the gods and goddesses acting strangely!  The sounds of drums and war chariots were heard even though no one was playing or driving them. It was very frightening! 

Vyasa explained that these were bad omens showing a terrible battle was coming.  He said, "This is fate, King. There is nothing you can do to stop it.  But remember, victory always goes to those who are good and right."
