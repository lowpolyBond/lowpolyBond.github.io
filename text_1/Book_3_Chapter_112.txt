Once upon a time, a wise man named Rishyasringa met a wonderful boy. This boy had beautiful, long, dark hair, tied up with golden strings.  He was handsome, with big, bright eyes and golden skin. He looked like a god!

The boy wore shiny jewelry that jingled when he walked, like tiny bells.  His clothes were amazing, much nicer than Rishyasringa's own. He even had special anklets that made a pretty sound.

He held a strange fruit that bounced up and down, and he twirled around as he played with it.  He was so happy and joyful!  He gave Rishyasringa some delicious fruit that had no skin or seeds – the best fruit Rishyasringa had ever tasted! He also gave him some yummy water.  

The boy kissed Rishyasringa and then left.  Rishyasringa felt sad when he left. He missed the boy already! He wanted to see the boy again every day and learn how to be as happy as he was.

Rishyasringa asked his father, “Who was that boy? What does he do? I want to be like him!” He was so happy to have met the boy, and he really wanted to see him again.
