The Pandavas, five brothers, were happily living in the forest.  They shared their food – yummy forest animals and sun-given gifts – with everyone.  Janamejaya asked, "But what were the Kauravas, the bad guys, doing while the Pandavas were so happy?"

Vaisampayana answered, "Duryodhana, Karna, and Dussasana, the mean Kaurava brothers, were plotting against the Pandavas. They wanted to hurt them!  Then, a grumpy but powerful holy man named Durvasa arrived with thousands of followers! He was very demanding. Duryodhana was super nice to him, even doing all his chores."

Durvasa was tricky! Sometimes he'd shout, "I'm starving, feed me NOW!" Other times he'd say, "I'm not hungry today!"  He kept testing Duryodhana, but Duryodhana stayed calm and kind. Finally, Durvasa was impressed. "I'll grant you a wish!" he said.

Duryodhana, Karna, and Dussasana had already planned their wish.  Duryodhana asked,  "Make Durvasa visit the Pandavas and their wife Draupadi. Make him visit at a time when everyone is asleep after dinner."

Durvasa agreed. He went to the Pandavas' forest home.  Duryodhana and his brothers were thrilled! Karna said, "The Pandavas are in big trouble now! Durvasa is so grumpy, they'll never be able to feed him and all his followers!"  They were happy because they thought the Pandavas were going to be in a big problem.  They all went home, giggling about their mean plan.
