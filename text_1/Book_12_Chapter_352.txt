Once upon a time, Brahma, the creator, told a story about a very special being called Purusha.  Purusha is super old and never changes.  He's everywhere!

Brahma said, "You can't see Purusha, not even I can! Only people who are calm and good can feel him inside. Purusha is inside *everyone*, but he doesn't do the things people do.  He's like your inner voice, watching everything."

Imagine Purusha as HUGE! The whole universe is his body – his head, arms, feet, everything!  He moves freely, like a bird flying through the air. He knows everything everyone does, good or bad. That's why they call him Kshetrajna, the one who knows everything.

Brahma tried to explain how Purusha enters and leaves people, but even he couldn't fully understand!  He said Purusha is like a fire that burns in many places, or the sun whose light shines everywhere.  The wind blows in different ways, but it's still the same wind. The ocean is one, but it has many waves.

Purusha is like that.  He's one, but everything comes from him and goes back to him. To understand Purusha, you have to forget about your body and what you do.  If you calm your heart and think about his four parts – Aniruddha, Pradyumna, Sankarshana, and Vasudeva – you can feel him too.

Some people call him the highest soul, the one soul, or just the soul.  He's Narayana, the universal soul.  He's like a lotus leaf, untouched by the water around it.  He's never affected by anyone's actions.

There are many things Purusha *is*: the knower and the thing known, the thinker and the thought, the eater and the food.  He is both with and without parts.  He is the light from which everything comes. Even Brahma himself came from Purusha!  Brahma and all the Gods give Purusha the best part of their food.

Purusha is divided into four parts, and he plays with them. He is the greatest of all, and knowing this makes you peaceful. So, that’s the story of Purusha, the one who is everywhere, in everything.
