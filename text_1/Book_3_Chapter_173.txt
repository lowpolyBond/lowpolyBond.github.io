Arjuna told his story: "King Indra, the god of heaven, was so impressed with me! He gave me powerful weapons.  He said, 'Arjuna, you are the strongest warrior! No one can beat you!'  He even gave me shiny armor, a magical shell that roared like thunder, and a beautiful crown. I lived happily in Indra's palace with the Gandharvas (magical beings) for five years.  Then Indra said, 'Arjuna, it's time to go. Your brothers miss you.' I knew they needed me because of the big argument about the game of dice. So I returned to see my brothers."

Yudhishthira said, "Arjuna, you were so lucky! You got amazing weapons, met mighty gods, and even defeated the powerful Nivata-Kavachas!  It feels like we've already won the war!"

Arjuna smiled, "Tomorrow, youâ€™ll see all my powerful weapons, the ones I used to defeat those scary Nivata-Kavachas!"

Then the storyteller, Vaisampayana, said, "Arjuna and his brothers spent the night together, happy to be reunited."
