Once upon a time, a wise man named Galava wanted to meet the gods.  He asked Garuda, a giant bird with beautiful feathers, to take him there.  Garuda was super strong and super fast!

"Please, Garuda," said Galava, "fly me east, to where the gods live!"

Garuda agreed.  Whoosh! He flew so fast, Galava held on tight!  The wind blew so hard, it was like a big storm!  Galava saw trees flying past, the ocean splashing up, and even fish and snakes getting tossed around!

"Whoa, Garuda!" shouted Galava. "This is too fast! I can't see anything! My ears are ringing! I promised to give my teacher eight hundred special horses, but I don't have them!  I can't even see to find them!  I feel sick!"

Garuda laughed. "Don't worry!" he said.  "Death can't be forced. Why didn't you tell me your problem before? We'll land on a mountain called Rishabha. We'll eat, rest, and then I'll help you find those horses!"

So Garuda landed on the mountain. He knew how to help Galava keep his promise!  He was a very clever bird.
