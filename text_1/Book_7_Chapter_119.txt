Satyaki, a super-strong warrior, was a total hero!  He'd already beaten the Yavana and Kamvoja armies.  He fought like a brave tiger hunting deer!  He wore shiny gold armor and had a beautiful flag on his chariot.  His bow was strong and golden, and he looked like a shining sun!  He was so strong, he looked like a powerful bull in a field of cows.

Lots of Kaurava soldiers wanted to fight him.  They came rushing at him from all sides, like angry tigers!  They were from Drona's army and even Jalasandha's!  It was a huge battle!  Big, important Kaurava warriors like Duryodhana, Duhsasana, and Sakuni all tried to stop him.  It was so noisy, it sounded like a giant ocean storm!

Satyaki smiled.  "Don't worry," he told his driver.  "I'll fight them all! I'm as strong as the god Indra!" He shot his arrows and killed tons of enemy soldiers, elephants, and horses.  It was like a battle between gods and monsters!

The fight was super fierce!  Satyaki's arrows never missed!  He shot so many arrows, it was like a rain of golden arrows.  The Kauravas were scared and ran around like they were freezing!  He was even better than Arjuna!

Duryodhana and his friends shot lots of arrows at Satyaki, but he shot them back!  He even broke Duryodhana's friend's bow! He even hit Duryodhana!

Then, Duryodhana shot Satyaki's driver.  The driver fell, and Duryodhana's chariot ran away without him!  All the Kaurava soldiers saw this and ran away too.

Satyaki chased them, shooting even more arrows.  He beat thousands of soldiers and finally went to find Arjuna.  Everyone was amazed at how brave Satyaki was!  They cheered for him!
