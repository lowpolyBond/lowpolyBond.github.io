Abhimanyu, Arjuna's son, was a brave warrior. He fought Karna, a powerful enemy.  They shot many arrows at each other!  Abhimanyu rained arrows down on Karna, and Karna did the same to Abhimanyu.  They were both covered in arrows and blood, but they looked amazing, like beautiful flowers!

Abhimanyu was super strong. He killed six of Karna's best friends, along with their horses and chariots. He even shot ten arrows at other brave warriors!  He fought so bravely, he killed many more warriors, including the prince of Magadha and a prince from Bhoja.

Then, Duhsasana's son attacked Abhimanyu. He shot arrows at Abhimanyu's horses, his driver, and Abhimanyu himself. Abhimanyu fought back, shooting many arrows at Duhsasana's son and yelling, "Your father ran away like a coward! You won't escape today!"

Abhimanyu then fought Salya, hitting him with lots of arrows! He broke Salya's bow and killed his drivers.  He kept fighting, killing many more warriors.  

But many warriors teamed up against Abhimanyu. They saw how brave he was! They were impressed by how fast and skillful he was, but they were worried. One said, "We need to work together to defeat him!"  Karna was even afraid!

Drona, a wise teacher, told Karna, "Abhimanyu is young and strong. His armor is very good. But you can still beat him. Cut his bow, break his chariot, and kill his drivers."

Karna, along with other strong warriors, followed Drona's plan. They broke Abhimanyu's bow and killed his horses and drivers. Now Abhimanyu had no chariot!

But Abhimanyu was still brave.  He jumped up in the air! He held a sword and shield and fought like a bird.  He was so strong and fast!  But the other warriors were watching and they shot arrows at him.

Drona broke Abhimanyu's sword. Karna broke his shield. Abhimanyu fell to the ground. He even grabbed a wheel and kept fighting!  Even though he was hurt and bleeding, he fought bravely until the end. He was a truly amazing warrior!
