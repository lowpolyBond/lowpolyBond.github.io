Once upon a time, the wind god, Vayu, told a wonderful story. He said, "I'll tell you about good deeds and bad deeds.  Listen carefully!

If someone is kind during the rainy season, sharing food and water with the needy and offering special treats to the priests, they'll be very blessed.  It's like doing a hundred amazing good deeds all at once!  They'll light lamps for their ancestors and offer special gifts.  Being kind and thoughtful is very important.

But Vayu also warned about bad things.  He said, if someone lets a common person light the sacred fire or lets women who shouldnâ€™t help with the ceremonies do so, it's very wrong. It's like making the gods and ancestors angry!  They might even have to be born as a common person in their next life.

So, what can you do if you accidentally do something wrong?  Don't worry! Vayu shared a secret. For three days, you can make special offerings to the fire using cow's urine, dung, milk, and ghee (clarified butter). You must fast and be very careful while you do it.  If you do this, the gods and ancestors will forgive you, and you'll be happy and healthy.

Vayu said, "Doing good things and fixing mistakes will help you to be happy and go to a wonderful place after you die." So, always try to be kind and good, just like Vayu told us!
