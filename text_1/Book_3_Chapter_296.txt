Once upon a time, King Dyumatsena went blind.  He couldn't see!  But then, magically, he could see again!  He and his wife, Saivya, were so worried about their son, Satyavan. They searched everywhere â€“ near rivers, in forests, and even through dark woods.  They called out, "Satyavan! Savitri!"  Their feet got hurt, but they kept looking.

Kind holy men found them.  They said, "Don't worry! Satyavan is alive!"  They knew because of Savitri, Satyavan's wonderful wife. She was so good and strong, they knew she wouldn't let anything bad happen to him.

That very night, Satyavan and Savitri came back! Everyone was so happy!  They all hugged and celebrated.  Satyavan explained that he'd fallen asleep in the forest and couldn't come back earlier.

But Savitri had a secret.  She told the holy men that the God of Death wanted to take Satyavan away.  But Savitri was so brave! She asked the God of Death for wishes. She wished for her father-in-law to see again and get his kingdom back. She wished for her father to have lots of sons, and for herself too!  And she wished for Satyavan to live a long, long time.  Because of her bravery, everyone was happy and safe!

The holy men were amazed. They praised Savitri for being so good and brave.  Then, they all went home, feeling happy and peaceful.
