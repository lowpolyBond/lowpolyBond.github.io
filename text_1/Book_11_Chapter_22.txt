Once upon a time, after a big battle, Gandhari, the queen, looked sadly at the battlefield.  

"Look!" she cried. "The king of Avanti is dead!  Bhima killed him.  Birds and animals are eating his body.  He had many friends, but now he's all alone."

Gandhari pointed to another fallen warrior. "That's Bahlika, a strong and brave warrior, killed by Arjuna. He looks like a sleeping tiger, even in death. His face is still bright and beautiful."

Then she showed Arjuna’s another victim, Jayadratha.  "Arjuna killed Jayadratha, too!  Even though Jayadratha was protected by many soldiers, Arjuna fought his way through them all.  Now vultures are eating Jayadratha."

Gandhari explained, "Jayadratha was a bad man. He once tried to take Draupadi away, but the Pandavas let him go because of his sister, Duhshala."

Now Gandhari’s daughter, Duhshala, was crying.  She was very sad because her husband, Jayadratha, was dead. She ran around looking for his head. All Jayadratha's wives were very sad too.  They cried and cried. They missed their brave husband terribly.

Gandhari sighed.  "My poor daughter is a widow now.  All my daughters-in-law have lost their husbands. What can be worse than this?"  She was very, very sad.
