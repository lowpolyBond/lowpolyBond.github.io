Once upon a time, there was a huge battle.  It was dark and dusty at first, but then it got bright.  Brave warriors fought, trying to defeat each other.

Imagine thousands of lamps shining!  The battlefield was so bright it looked like the night sky full of stars.  It was amazing, but also scary, like the whole world was on fire! Elephants fought elephants, horses fought horses, and soldiers in chariots fought each other.  It was a very loud and exciting battle!  Arjuna, a very strong warrior, fought very bravely and started to defeat the Kaurava army.

King Dhritarashtra, worried about his son Duryodhana's army, asked, "What happened to my soldiers when Arjuna, that powerful warrior, attacked? What did Duryodhana do? Who protected Drona, the wise teacher, in battle?  Arjuna was so brave, like a dancing tiger, defeating many enemies. How did Drona die?"  Dhritarashtra was upset because the messenger always talked about how strong the Pandavas were and never talked about the strengths of his own army.

The messenger, Sanjaya, explained that Duryodhana had a plan.  He told his brothers and friends, "Protect Drona! Hridika's son will protect his right side, and Sala will protect his left.  The Trigarta warriors will be at the front. Drona is very strong, he could even beat the gods!  We must protect him from Dhrishtadyumna, the only one who can defeat him.  If we protect Drona, he will defeat the enemy. Then Karna will defeat Arjuna! Then I'll defeat the rest. If we win this battle, we will always win!"

So, the Kaurava army fought bravely to protect Drona.  Arjuna and the Pandavas fought hard too!  There were many arrows flying, and everyone was shouting. It was the fiercest battle anyone had ever seen!
