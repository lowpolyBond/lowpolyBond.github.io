Rama showed Sita a beautiful river, the Mandakini.  It flowed from the mountains.  "Look, Sita!" he said. "It's so pretty! Swans and cranes play in the water.  Lots of colorful flowers grow nearby. It's even prettier than a river in a magical land!"

The river was a little muddy.  Deer had been drinking there.  People who were very holy bathed in the river.  They prayed to the sun. The wind made the trees sway, and it looked like the mountain was dancing!  The wind also blew flowers into the river.  It was like the mountain was giving the river a gift.

"Look, Sita," Rama said, "the water sparkles like jewels!  Many wonderful people live near here.  See the geese? Theyâ€™re having fun!"

Rama smiled. "Being here with you, Sita, is much better than being in our palace! Let's bathe in the river!"

He took Sita's hand. "Let's pretend these people are our friends from Ayodhya, and this river is our Sarayu river. Throw flowers at me, Sita, and splash me!"

Rama was very happy. "Having honey, berries, and fruits with you, Sita, is better than all the food in Ayodhya.  Even Lakshmana is happy here! We can bathe three times a day and see elephants, monkeys, and lions! Flowers bloom here all year!"

Rama and Sita walked together on the beautiful Cittrakuta mountain, talking about the wonderful Mandakini River.
