One morning, King Janaka visited Suka, a wise young man.  He brought beautiful gifts – a fancy chair and precious jewels.  He bowed deeply and gave the chair to Suka. Then, he washed Suka's feet and offered him more gifts, like cows. Suka accepted politely and asked how the king was doing.  He even asked about everyone in the kingdom!  King Janaka sat down on the ground and asked why Suka had come.

Suka said, "My father told me you’re very wise about becoming one with the universe. He said you could answer my questions about life's purpose and how to find inner peace."

King Janaka said, "Okay, let's talk about it.  After a Brahmin boy grows up, he studies holy books. He learns to control his feelings and helps his teacher.  Then, he gets married, has a family, and builds a home.  Later, he can live in the forest, still being kind and helping others. Finally, he can let go of everything and focus on inner peace."

Suka asked, "If someone already understands everything, does he still need to go through all those steps?"

King Janaka answered, "No.  Understanding is key! You need a good teacher to guide you.  That's like a boat helping you cross the ocean of life. Once you're across, you can leave the boat behind.  But those steps help keep the world going, and they can lead to peace over many lifetimes. If you're very, very good, you could reach peace even while young!"

King Janaka continued, "You need to control your anger and sadness. Be calm and peaceful like a fish in water.  See yourself in everyone and everyone in yourself.  Don't fear anything and don't want anything too much. Be equal to rich and poor, happy and sad, good and bad. Imagine a lamp lighting up a dark house – that's knowledge revealing your true self.  You already have this knowledge, Suka! You're already peaceful and wise.  But you still need to try your best to reach full inner peace. You don't see the difference between happiness and sadness. You don’t want things, and you have no fear.  You're already on the right path! Anything else you want to know?"
