Arjuna was puzzled.  He asked a Gandharva (a magical being), "Why did King Kalmashapada send his queen to the wise Vasishtha? And why did Vasishtha, such a good man, do something wrong?"

The Gandharva explained, "It all started with a curse!  King Kalmashapada was cursed by Saktri, Vasishtha's son.  The curse made the king very angry and confused."

"The cursed king and his queen wandered in the forest. One day, the king was very hungry. He saw a holy man and his wife together.  Scared, they ran away. The king caught the holy man and wouldn't let him go."

"The holy man's wife begged the king, 'Please, let my husband go!  We were just about to be together.' But the king was so angry and hungry, he ate the holy man!"

"The holy man's wife was heartbroken and furious. She cursed the king, 'Because you ate my husband, you will die when you try to be with your wife!  And your wife will have a son with Vasishtha, and that son will continue your family!'"

"The angry wife then disappeared in a big fire.  Wise Vasishtha knew what had happened.  Later, when the king's curse was lifted, he went to his wife. She sent him away, reminding him of the curse.  The king was very sorry. That's why he asked Vasishtha to have a son with his queen â€“ to continue his family line, as the curse said."
