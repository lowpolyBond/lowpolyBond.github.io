King Drupada was going to marry off his daughter, Krishna.  He had planned for only one groom, but the gods had other ideas!  A wise Rishi explained that this was fate.  It was meant to be.  Krishna had wished for a husband, and the gods granted her wish—in a very special way!  King Drupada agreed, saying, "If the gods have planned this, it's alright."

Then, a very important priest named Vyasa said, "Today is a lucky day! Yudhishthira, the oldest Pandava brother, should marry Krishna first!"

Everyone got ready for the wedding.  King Drupada’s palace sparkled.  It was beautifully decorated with flowers and jewels. It looked like a bright, starry night!

The five Pandava brothers, all handsome and strong, arrived. They looked like powerful bulls going to a field of cows!  Priest Dhaumya performed the wedding ceremony for Yudhishthira and Krishna.  They walked around a sacred fire and held hands.

Amazingly, after each brother married Krishna, she became ready to marry the next! This happened every day.  The next day Bhima married her, then Arjuna, and so on. It was a very special magical thing!

After the weddings, King Drupada gave each Pandava brother many gifts:  one hundred shiny chariots pulled by four horses, one hundred strong elephants, and one hundred beautiful servants. He gave them lots of gold and jewels too.

The Pandava brothers were so happy! They lived happily ever after in King Drupada's kingdom, with Krishna and all their wonderful gifts.  They felt like kings among kings!
