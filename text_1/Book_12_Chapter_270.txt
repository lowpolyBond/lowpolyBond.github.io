Once upon a time, a wise teacher named Kapila told a story. He said, "The Vedas are like really important books. Everyone listens to them!  There are two kinds of Brahma:  a Brahma you can hear about, and a Great Brahma you can't see. If you learn about the Brahma you can hear, you can understand the Great Brahma."

He explained that special ceremonies, using words from the Vedas, made people pure.  These pure people were called Brahmins, and they could learn all about Brahma.  Kapila said, "Being good and pure is the best way to be happy and free."  Only you know if you're truly pure inside.  You can't know it just from books or guessing.

He talked about really good people. They didn't want lots of things. They helped others and did what was right, just because it was the right thing to do.  They were kind and peaceful. They followed the rules in the Vedas. They were like really bright stars in the sky!

These people were happy because they always did what was right. They didn't need to fix mistakes because they didn't make any! They were strong and wise, following the Vedas, not their own ideas. They never had to apologize because they always followed the rules.  The Vedas said that only people who didn't follow the rules completely needed to make things right.

Many Brahmins were like this – very smart, good, and famous. They always worshipped Brahma and weren't greedy.  They were so wise that they went beyond the normal worries of life. Their good deeds, learning, and prayers were like the Great Brahma.  This is what the ancient stories say.

Their good acts were like magic, making their wishes come true and helping them get rid of bad feelings.  Good behavior is very old and never changes.  Sometimes people don't follow all the rules perfectly, so they divided the good ways of living into four parts to make it easier.  But everyone, no matter how they live – whether at home, in the forest, or as a student – can become pure by being good.

These pure Brahmins shone like bright stars. They were so happy and peaceful they reached a special place where everything is perfect. Even if they were reborn, they wouldn't be bad because of past mistakes.  A true Brahmin studies hard, is wise, and practices Yoga.

Being a Brahmin isn't about doing things perfectly; it's about being a good person. Good deeds make you happy; bad deeds make you unhappy.  Pure people, free of bad feelings, see everything as part of Brahma.  Everyone should follow the same good rules, no matter how they live their lives.  A peaceful heart is the best place for this wisdom to grow.

Someone asked Kapila, "If people give things away, pray, study the Vedas, or live simply after having enjoyed life, who goes to the best place in heaven?"

Kapila answered, "Family life is good, but a simple life is even better. You can see this for yourself."

Another person asked, "If people believe in knowledge or good deeds, and both ways lead to the same great place, what is the difference?"

Kapila replied, "Good deeds make you pure, but knowledge is the highest goal.  When you’re pure inside, and you have wisdom, kindness, peace, and truthfulness, then you are on the right path. That’s how you reach the highest place.  Knowing the Vedas is essential; otherwise, you are just like empty air! The Vedas explain everything, even the past, present, and future.  Everything exists and doesn't exist at the same time. Only someone wise can understand this."

Kapila explained that letting go of everything leads to happiness and freedom – a perfect, happy, and endless place that is Brahma himself.  Controlling your feelings, being forgiving, and not being greedy will help you reach that place.  He bowed to Brahma, the creator of everything, the unchanging, undying source of all things.
