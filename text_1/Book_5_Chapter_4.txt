King Drupada said, "Strong warrior, Duryodhana will never give up the kingdom peacefully.  His father, Dhritarashtra, loves him too much and will agree with him.  Bhishma and Drona are too old and confused to stop him. Karna and Sakuni are just foolish.  We should follow Valadeva’s advice and try to make peace. But we can’t be nice to Duryodhana! He's mean and won't listen. Being nice to him would be like being nice to a donkey. We need to be firm, like with a cow.  If we're nice, he’ll think he's won.

So, let's get ready for war! Let's send messages to our friends to gather an army.  Let's send messengers quickly to Salya, Dhrishtaketu, Jayatsena, and the Kekaya prince. Duryodhana will also ask other kings for help.  But it's best to ask our friends *first*.  This is a big job!

We need to hurry!  Send messages to Salya and his kings, to King Bhagadatta by the eastern sea, to Hardikya, Ahuka, the Mallas king, and Rochamana.  Tell Vrihanta, Senavindu, Vahlika, Mudjakesa, the Chedi king, Suparsva, Suvahu, the brave Paurava, and the kings of Saka, Pahlava, and Darada to come.  Tell Surari, Nadija, Karnavest, Nila, Viradharman, Durjaya, Dantavakra, Rukmi, Janamejaya, Ashada, Vayuvega, Purvapali, Bhuritejas, Devaka, Ekalaya and his sons to join us!

Tell the Krausha kings, Kshemamurti, the Kamboja and Richika kings, the western coast kings, Jayatsena, the Kashi king, the Five Rivers kings, Kratha’s son, the mountain kings, Janaki, Susarman, Maniman, Potimatsyaka, Dhrishtaketu, the Pansu king, Paundra, Dandadhara, Vrihatsena, Aparajita, Nishada, Srenimat, Vasumat, the strong Vrihadvala, Vahu, Samudrasena and his son, Uddhava, Kshemaka, Vatadhana, Srutayus, Dridhayus, Salwa’s son, the Kalinga king, and the brave Kumara to come!  Tell them all to come quickly!

And send our wise priest to Dhritarashtra. Tell him exactly what to say to Dhritarashtra, Duryodhana, Bhishma, and Drona!"
