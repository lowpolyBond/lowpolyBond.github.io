King Janamejaya asked, "Wise one, how could Bhima, so strong, be scared by a snake? He's super strong, like ten thousand elephants!  How could he be afraid?"

The storyteller, Vaisampayana, said, "King, Bhima was exploring a beautiful forest.  It was full of amazing animals, singing birds, and sparkling streams.  He was having fun, hunting with his bow and arrow.  He was so strong! He killed many wild boars and buffaloes. He even pulled up trees!  He shouted and roared, scaring lions and elephants.

Then, Bhima saw a HUGE snake! It was as big as a hill! Its scales were bright yellow and orange.  Its mouth was like a cave, with sharp teeth.  It looked scary!  It hissed, like it was angry.

The snake was super strong, too. It grabbed Bhima!  Bhima, even though he was as strong as ten thousand elephants, couldn't move! He was scared and paralyzed. The snake's magic made him lose all his strength."
