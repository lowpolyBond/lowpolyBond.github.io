After a big battle, the brave Arjuna came home.  The Pandava brothers – Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva – went to a beautiful garden in the mountains.  This garden belonged to Kubera, the king of riches!  They played and had fun for four years, which felt like just one night!  They were happy, but they also missed their kingdom.

Six years before that, they had to live in the forest.  So, they had been hidden away for ten years already!

Then, Bhima, the strong one, talked to Yudhishthira. He said, "Brother, it's time to go home!  We promised to take back our kingdom. We can trick our enemies, the Kauravas, led by the mean Duryodhana.  We'll hide, then surprise them and defeat them!"

Arjuna, the best archer, was there too, along with Nakula and Sahadeva.  They had Krishna, a super-smart and powerful friend, fighting with them.  Bhima said, "We are strong!  We can beat them all and win back what is rightfully ours!"

Yudhishthira agreed.  He said goodbye to the beautiful mountain and its amazing sights.  He promised to come back someday.  Ghatotkacha, a mighty Rakshasa (a kind of magical being), helped them cross the rivers and waterfalls.

A wise old man, Lomasa, gave them good advice.  Another wise man, Arshtishena, also helped them on their way.  The Pandavas, with their friends, travelled through beautiful places, ready for their big fight.
