Princess Damayanti was very beautiful.  Many princes wanted to marry her.  She had a special way of choosing her husband.  She asked the gods to help her.

Damayanti loved a prince named Nala.  She told him, "I love you, Nala!  I'll do anything for you.  But choosing you might make people angry at the gods."  She was worried. She even said she might hurt herself if he didn't love her back!

Nala was kind but worried too. He said, "Damayanti, many powerful gods want to marry you.  They're much greater than me. Choosing a god would be much better."  He listed some amazing gods, powerful and strong.

Damayanti's eyes filled with tears.  She said, "I only want you, Nala!"  But she had a clever idea.  She said, "Let all the gods come to the choosing ceremony. Then, I'll choose you in front of everyone!  That way, no one can blame you."

Nala went to tell the gods. They were curious.  "Did you see Damayanti?" they asked.  "What did she say?"

Nala told them everything.  He said Damayanti only saw him because the gods helped him get close to her without being seen.  He said Damayanti loved him and wanted him to be her husband. He said she would choose him at the special ceremony with all the gods watching.  The gods agreed to her plan.  They would all be there.  

Now, everyone was waiting for the big day of the choosing ceremony!
