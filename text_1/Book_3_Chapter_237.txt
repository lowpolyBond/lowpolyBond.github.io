Once upon a time, King Dhritarashtra's family wanted to check on their cows.  A clever cowherd told the king this was a great time for a hunting trip, too!  He suggested Prince Duryodhana, Dhritarashtra's son, should go.

But the king was worried.  He knew the Pandavas, his nephews, lived nearby in the forest.  They had been tricked and were now living a hard life.  The king said, "The Pandavas are strong warriors.  They're upset, and Duryodhana and his friends might make them angry.  It's dangerous!"

Duryodhana's uncle, Sakuni, promised they wouldn't cause any trouble. "We just want to look at the cows and go hunting," he said. "We won't even go near the Pandavas."

Dhritarashtra wasn't completely convinced, but he let them go.  Duryodhana, Karna, and many others went with a HUGE group!  They had thousands of soldiers, elephants, horses, and even shops and musicians following them!  It was a noisy, exciting journey.  They set up camp near the lake, far enough away from where the Pandavas were staying.
