Once upon a time, a wise teacher named Vasishtha explained something amazing about life. He said that we, like the moon, go through many, many lives.  The moon seems to get bigger and smaller, right?  That's because we only see fifteen parts of it. There's a sixteenth part we can't see.  It always stays the same.

We're like that too! We have fifteen parts that change all the time. These parts are like our bodies and our feelings.  But we also have a sixteenth part, a special inner part, that's always good and pure. It's like the part of the moon we can’t see – always there, always the same.

Because of our mistakes and the things we learn from others, our fifteen changing parts make us take birth again and again.  It's like the moon waxing and waning, growing and shrinking.  But our special, unchanging part, that inner goodness, stays with us. It's always there, even though we can't always feel it.

This special, unchanging part is like a magical seed. It joins with our changing parts, making us who we are in each life.  Getting free from this cycle of birth and rebirth – getting rid of all our mistakes and learning to see that inner light – that's called liberation.  It's like finding the true, unchanging moon inside ourselves. It’s like discovering the true, unchanging YOU.

If we forget our pure, inner self and focus on the things that change, we might feel confused and lost. But if we remember that good, unchanging part, we can be free.  It's like remembering the hidden part of the moon—the part that's always shining bright!
