Guha, the ferryman, saw a HUGE army by the river.  He was worried!  "Friends!" he shouted. "That's Bharata's army!  He's probably here to hurt Rama, my friend, who's been sent away from his home."

Guha knew Bharata might want to hurt Rama to become king. "We need to protect Rama!" he said.  He told his friends to get ready to fight.  He ordered them to guard the river with boats, lots and lots of boats,  ready for anything.  "If Bharata is friendly, he can cross the river today," Guha said.

Guha took gifts of fish, meat, and honey to meet Bharata.  Bharata's wise advisor, Sumantra, saw Guha coming. "That's Guha!" he said to Bharata. "He's the king here, and he knows the forest. He's also Rama's friend. Let's talk to him."

Bharata said, "Tell Guha I want to meet him."

Guha met Bharata and said, "My land is yours! I didn't know you were coming, so my welcome might not be fancy, but everything I have is yours. Please stay at my house tonight! I brought you food from the forest â€“ fruits, roots, and meat."  He hoped Bharata and his army would stay the night as his guests.
