Once upon a time, a wise man named Markandeya told a king a story.  He said, "A long, long time ago, Brahma, the creator, had a son named Angiras. Angiras married a beautiful woman named Subha. They had many children!"

Angiras and Subha's son, Vrihaspati, was super strong and smart. He was a great advisor, very wise and kind.

They also had daughters!  The first, Bhanumati, was the most beautiful girl ever.  The second daughter, Raga, was loved by everyone.  The third, Siniwali, was so tiny, she sometimes seemed to disappear!  They said she was like Rudra's daughter.

Next came Archismati, who shone so brightly!  Then there was Havishmati, who loved to give gifts.  The sixth daughter was Mahismati, a very good and kind girl.  And finally, there was Mahamati, always at big ceremonies.

The last daughter was very special.  Her name was Kuhu.  People whispered "Coo-coo" when they talked about her because she was so amazing and unique, like a magical bird!
