Once upon a time, there was a brave warrior named Kartikeya.  He needed an army to fight bad guys called daityas.  Many, many mothers joined him!  Their names were long and wonderful â€“ Prabhavati, Vishalakshi, and hundreds more! These mothers were super strong and magical.  Some were as dark as clouds, some as bright as the sun, and some shimmered like gold. They had long nails, big teeth, and even longer hair.  They could change their shapes!

Kartikeya also got amazing gifts.  Indra gave him a shiny banner. Shiva gave him a powerful army of 30,000 super-strong warriors!  Vishnu gave him a special garland that made him even stronger.  Ganga gave him a magical water pot.  Garuda gave him a beautiful peacock.  Everyone wanted to help Kartikeya!

Kartikeya's army was amazing!  They marched with drums, horns, and cymbals.  They made a joyful noise!  The gods were so happy.  Kartikeya promised to defeat all their enemies.

Then, the battle began!  Kartikeya had a special weapon, a super-fast dart that whizzed through the air. When he threw it, it made thunder and lightning!  Millions of smaller darts flew out of it! The daityas were scared. They ran and hid.  Kartikeya defeated the strongest daityas: Taraka, Mahisha, and Tripada, with his army cheering him on.

One strong daitya, Vana, hid in a tall mountain.  Kartikeya threw his dart, and BOOM! The mountain shook! Animals ran, birds flew, and snakes slithered away.  Kartikeya defeated Vana too!

Everyone cheered for Kartikeya!  He had won!  The gods were so happy they showered him with flowers.  He became a great hero.  People celebrated, and the world was safe again.  That's the story of how Kartikeya, with his amazing army of mothers, saved the day!
