Once upon a time, a wise man named Vasishtha talked about cows. He said cows are amazing!  They give us milk and butter.  He loved cows so much, he said he felt like he was surrounded by them all the time!

Vasishtha said that if you say special words about cows every morning and night, it washes away your bad deeds.

He also said that if you give away many cows to good people, you'll go to a wonderful place after you die. This place is full of beautiful palaces and rivers of milk and cream!  Giving away lots and lots of cows makes your family happy, too, even your great-grandparents!

Vasishtha explained that cows are super important. They're like mothers to everyone, even the gods!  They’re so special that you should always be kind to them and keep them safe.  If you give a special cow as a gift, with a calf and a brass bowl, it’s like a magical ticket to a happy afterlife!  He said there's no better gift than a cow.

A great king named Saudasa listened to Vasishtha.  He thought what Vasishtha said was very important. So, he gave many, many cows to good people. Because of this, the king went to a happy place after he died!
