Once upon a time, in a land far away, a great battle was about to begin.  The Pandavas and the Kauravas, two families, were ready to fight.  Many, many soldiers from all over the land came to join them.  It was like a huge army!

The Pandavas, led by the brave Yudhishthira, set up their camp.  So many soldiers came that it seemed like everyone in the land was there!  Yudhishthira made sure everyone had food and even gave them special signs so they could tell who was on their side.

Then, the Kauravas, led by the mean Duryodhana, arrived.  He had his army and many elephants too! When the Panchalas, friends of the Pandavas, saw Duryodhana, they blew their horns and made a joyful noise.

The Pandavas, including the mighty Arjuna and Krishna, blew their own horns.  The sound was so loud it scared many soldiers!  A big cloud of dust filled the air, making it hard to see.  It was a scary, exciting sight!

Before the fighting started, both sides agreed on some rules.  A soldier fighting with a car should only fight another soldier with a car.  A soldier on an elephant should fight only an elephant soldier.  They promised not to attack someone who was already hurt, scared, or had dropped their weapons.  They wouldn't hurt people who were just helping out â€“ like the drummers and horn players.

After making these rules, both sides looked at each other.  They were ready for a big fight, but they were also excited to show their bravery and skill.  The battle of Kurukshetra was about to begin!
