Once upon a time, Baladeva, a very strong and powerful prince, went to a special place for bathing called Indra's tirtha.  It was a very holy place!  A long time ago, a powerful god named Indra had done many, many big sacrifices there, giving away lots and lots of treasures.  Because of this, the place was super special.

Baladeva bathed in the holy water and gave gifts to the wise priests. Then, he went to another special place called Rama's tirtha.  Rama was a very brave and holy man who had fought many battles and won!  He also did many big sacrifices there. He even gave the whole world to his teacher as a gift!  Baladeva bathed and gave gifts there too.

Next, he went to the Yamuna river.  This was another holy place where the god Varuna had done a super important sacrifice a long time ago.  There had even been a big battle between gods and monsters!  Baladeva gave gifts to the holy people there.

Finally, he went to the Aditya tirtha.  This was where the sun god Surya did a special sacrifice to become even more powerful.  Many, many gods and magical beings lived near this place!  Even the great wise man Vyasa had been there!  He and many other holy people got extra special powers by bathing there.

Baladeva bathed at all these holy places, gave gifts, and made many friends along the way!  He was a very kind and generous prince.
