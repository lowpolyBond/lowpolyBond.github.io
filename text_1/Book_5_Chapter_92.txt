Vidura, a wise old man, talked to Krishna one night.  He said, "Krishna, your visit wasn't a good idea. Duryodhana, the eldest of Dhritarashtra's sons, is a very bad person. He's mean, angry, and disobedient. He only cares about himself and doesn't listen to anyone older and wiser."

Vidura continued, "Duryodhana is very selfish and greedy. He thinks he's smart, but he's not. He doesn't listen to his friends, and he's always suspicious of everyone. He only cares about what he wants, ignoring what's right. He's a slave to his own desires."

"He trusts Bhishma, Drona, Kripa, Karna, and others. Because of this, he doesn't want peace. He thinks his army, especially with Karna, is too strong for the Pandavas to fight.  He believes Karna alone could defeat the Pandavas!"

"You, Krishna, want peace between the Pandavas and Kauravas. But Duryodhana and his brothers will never give the Pandavas what they deserve.  It's like talking to someone who can't hear. Your words won't help them understand."

Vidura warned, "Talking to them will be like talking to deaf people.  They won’t listen. They are wicked and proud. They are blinded by their own power and strength.  They won't listen to your good advice."

"Duryodhana is surrounded by a huge army. He thinks he's already won!  He's too proud to listen to anyone. Many kings are fighting alongside him because they are afraid of you, Krishna. They don't want to fight you."

Vidura worried for Krishna. "It's dangerous for you to be here, Krishna.  These men are your enemies! They are powerful and angry. I love you like I love the Pandavas, so I’m warning you – don’t stay.  Please leave."
