Once upon a time, Princess Damayanti's husband, King Nala, disappeared.  Damayanti, brave and kind, went into a scary forest to find him.

The forest was HUGE!  It had lions, tigers, leopards, and many other animals.  There were also lots of birds, and even some bad people.  It was full of tall trees, like bamboo and mango trees. Damayanti saw mountains, rivers, and lakes. She even saw scary goblins! But she wasn't afraid.  She was only sad because she missed Nala.

She sat down on a rock and cried.  "Nala!" she called. "Where are you? You promised you'd always be with me!"  She missed him so much.  She was all alone, and scared of the wild animals.

Damayanti talked to a big mountain. "Oh, Mountain," she asked, "have you seen my husband, Nala?"  She told the mountain all about Nala, how good and kind he was.

Then, Damayanti walked for three days and nights.  She found a peaceful place with wise holy men. They were very kind.  Damayanti told them her story.

The holy men said, "Don't worry!  You will see Nala again soon. He will be safe and happy."  Suddenly, POOF!  The holy men disappeared!

Damayanti was amazed! She kept looking for Nala. She talked to a beautiful tree, asking if it had seen him.

Finally, she saw a group of travelling merchants. She asked them if they had seen Nala.  They hadn't, but they told her they were going to the city of Suvahu.  Damayanti hoped she could find Nala there.  She continued her journey, full of hope.
