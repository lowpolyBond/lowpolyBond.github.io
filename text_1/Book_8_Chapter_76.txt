Bhima was fighting lots of enemies!  He told his driver, "Drive me right into the middle of the Kaurava army!  I'll defeat them all!"

The driver sped forward.  Suddenly, tons of Kaurava soldiers – on elephants, in chariots, on horses, and on foot – attacked Bhima from all sides!  They shot many arrows at Bhima's chariot.

But Bhima was strong!  He used his own special golden arrows and smashed the enemy arrows into pieces!  The Kaurava soldiers screamed like a mountain cracking with thunder.  They charged at Bhima, but he was so powerful, he fought like a giant! He was unstoppable!  The Kaurava army scattered and ran away in fear.

Bhima then said to his driver, "I can't tell friend from foe in all this fighting!  Make sure I don't hit our own army!" He was worried.  His brother, Arjuna, wasn't there yet.  And he was worried about his brother Yudhishthira, the king.  He wondered if they were even still alive.

"Don't worry," said his driver, Visoka. "You still have 60,000 arrows, plus many more weapons!"

Bhima said, "Today, everyone will know if I win or lose!  I'll fight until the end!"  He wanted to show everyone how strong he was.

Just then, Visoka shouted, "Look! Arjuna is here!"  Arjuna was fighting bravely, shooting arrows like lightning!  His chariot was magnificent, with a shining crown and a big, strong ape on his flag.  His friend Krishna was there too, with his bright discus and a beautiful conch shell.  Arjuna was winning the battle, defeating hundreds of soldiers!

Visoka said, "Bhima, your brother is here and has won many victories! Your wishes have all come true!"

Bhima was so happy! He gave Visoka many gifts for the good news. "Thank you for telling me!" he said.
