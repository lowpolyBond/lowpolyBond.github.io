King Dhritarashtra was worried.  His son, Duryodhana, was losing the big battle!  He asked his advisor, Sanjaya, "Bhima is so strong!  He's like a roaring thunderstorm! Who dared to fight him?  No one can stand against him!"

Sanjaya said, "The brave warrior Karna was the only one who faced Bhima.  Karna was strong too, like a big, strong tree in a storm!  Bhima and Karna fought with their maces and arrows.  It was a HUGE battle!  The ground shook! The elephants and horses got scared and ran away! Even the sky got dark and gloomy!"

"They shot so many arrows at each other!" continued Sanjaya. "Bhima broke Karna's bow. Karna got a new bow and kept fighting.  Bhima even killed Karna's driver with an arrow! Then Bhima made Karna's horses fall down.  Karna had to jump off his chariot!"

"Bhima won that fight," Sanjaya explained. "He shouted a mighty roar when he won.  Everyone heard it!  Yudhishthira, Bhimaâ€™s brother, was very happy.  All the Pandava soldiers cheered.  The Kaurava soldiers shouted back, but Bhima's roar was the loudest of all!  Even after that, Karna and Bhima kept fighting, but Bhima was much stronger and hit Karna harder each time."

Dhritarashtra sighed. He knew Bhima was a fearsome warrior.  He was sad that his side was losing.
