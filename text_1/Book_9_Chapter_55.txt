Once upon a time, during the great Kurukshetra war, a very important mace fight was about to happen.  King Dhritarashtra, Duryodhana's father, was worried. He asked his advisor, Sanjaya, "How did my son, Duryodhana, fight Bhima?"

Sanjaya said, "Duryodhana was happy to fight! He saw Yudhishthira, the Pandava king, and was polite. He offered Yudhishthira a seat and asked how he was. Yudhishthira said, 'I've heard that Kurukshetra is a very special place.  If someone dies fighting here, they go straight to heaven!'  Then, Yudhishthira went to a special spot called Samantapanchaka."

Duryodhana, with his big mace, went to fight the Pandavas.  Everyone cheered!  The sound of horns and drums filled the air.  They all went to a nice, firm spot near the Sarasvati river for the fight.

Bhima looked strong and ready, like a giant eagle! Duryodhana, in shining gold armor, looked like a golden mountain! He challenged Bhima to fight. Bhima, with his strong mace, challenged him back!

They stood there, ready to fight, like two huge mountains. They were both very angry and strong. They were so strong, they seemed like gods fighting!  They looked like powerful animals: angry elephants, fierce lions, even like deadly snakes! They were unstoppable, like two huge storms or the sun itself!

Duryodhana shouted, "Look, everyone! Watch me fight Bhima!"  All the kings and important people watched.  Even Krishna was there!

Then, Duryodhana and Bhima, both ready with their big maces, looked at each other, really, really angry.  They were ready to fight like powerful gods fighting a huge battle!  They were ready to fight!
