After the big battle, many Kaurava soldiers were dead.  Dhritarashtra, the blind king, asked Sanjaya, "What happened to Kritavarma, Kripa, and Drona's son? And what did my son, Duryodhana, do?"

Sanjaya said, "After the Kaurava ladies left, the three brave warriors were worried. They heard the Pandavas cheering.  It was getting dark, and the Kaurava camp was empty.  They wanted to save King Duryodhana, so they ran to a lake.

The Pandavas were very happy! They looked everywhere for Duryodhana, wanting to catch him. But he was fast! He had run to the lake and used magic to make the water hard like ground, so he could hide inside.  The Pandavas' horses got tired, so they went back to camp to rest.

Later, Kritavarma, Kripa, and Drona's son went to the lake. They found Duryodhana hiding in the water and said, "King, get up and fight! Win and rule the land, or die bravely in battle!  The Pandavas are weak and hurt; we'll protect you!"

Duryodhana said, "I'm glad you're alive! We're all tired and hurt.  The Pandavas are strong. Let's rest tonight and fight tomorrow."

Drona's son said, "No! I swear I'll defeat the Pandavas tonight! I won't rest until I defeat them!"

While they talked, some hunters came to the lake. They usually gave Bhima, a Pandava, meat.  They overheard everything. They knew Duryodhana was hiding.  Earlier, a Pandava had asked them about Duryodhana. The hunters thought, "We'll tell the Pandavas where he is! They'll give us lots of rewards!"

They rushed to the Pandava camp and told Bhima everything. Bhima gave them gifts and told Yudhishthira, the Pandava king.  Yudhishthira and his brothers were so happy! They all ran to the lake.  Everyone shouted and cheered, "We found Duryodhana!"

Duryodhana heard the loud noise. Kripa, Kritavarma, and Drona's son told him the Pandavas were coming. Duryodhana said, "Okay," and stayed hidden in the lake.  The three warriors left, feeling sad, and stopped to rest under a big tree, wondering what would happen to the king.
