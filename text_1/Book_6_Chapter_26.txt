Once upon a time, on a battlefield, Arjuna, a great warrior, felt very sad.  He didn't want to fight his family and friends.  His eyes filled with tears.  He was very upset.

Arjuna said, "How can I fight against my teachers, Bhishma and Drona? They are so great and powerful! It feels wrong to fight them. I'd rather be poor and live a simple life than hurt them."  He was confused and didn't know what to do.  He asked his friend Krishna for help.

Krishna, a wise and kind teacher, said, "Arjuna, don't be sad.  It’s okay to feel this way.  But you are a warrior, and this is your duty.  We all live, and we all die.  Our bodies change, just like clothes get old and we get new ones. Our souls are like the clothes, they are always here, changing but always ourselves."

Krishna explained that our souls are immortal – they never really die.  They just move on to a new body.  He said, "Arjuna, don't think of yourself as a killer.  You're just doing what's right. You aren't killing souls, only bodies.  The soul is eternal."

Krishna told Arjuna that a warrior should fight bravely and fairly.  He reminded Arjuna it's not about winning or losing, it's about doing what is right. He said being ashamed is worse than death.  He encouraged Arjuna to fight without worrying about the result.

Krishna then taught Arjuna about Yoga – a way to focus your mind and find inner peace. He said to let go of all your worries and desires.  Focus only on what you are doing, and don't worry about what happens afterward. 

Krishna explained that a peaceful mind is a strong mind. If you're calm and focused, nothing can bother you.  Arjuna learned to control his emotions, and he found his inner peace.

Arjuna listened carefully to Krishna's wise words. He realized that fighting was his duty, and he found the strength to continue.  He was ready to fight and to do the right thing.
