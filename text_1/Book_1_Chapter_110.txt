Long ago, in a great kingdom, lived a powerful family called the Kurus.  Their leader, Bhishma, was very wise. He worried that the family might become small.  He wanted to make sure it stayed strong and big, like the ocean!

Bhishma knew of three wonderful princesses.  One was from the Yadava family, another from the Suvala family, and the third was a princess from Madra.  They were all beautiful and kind. Bhishma thought they would be perfect wives for the Kuru princes.  He asked Vidura, a very important and wise man, for advice.  Vidura said, "You are like a father and mother to us, Bhishma.  Do what you think is best."

Bhishma heard some exciting news! Gandhari, a princess from the Suvala family, had prayed to a powerful god and received a special gift: she would have one hundred sons!  Bhishma decided to marry Gandhari to Dhritarashtra, a Kuru prince who was blind.

King Suvala, Gandhari's father, was worried at first because Dhritarashtra couldn't see. But the Kuru family was so famous and respected that he agreed.  Gandhari loved Dhritarashtra so much that she even covered her own eyes, to show she understood and supported him!

Her brother, Sakuni, brought Gandhari to the wedding.  It was a huge celebration!  Everyone was happy. Gandhari was kind and respectful to everyone. She loved Dhritarashtra very much and only ever talked about him and other important people. She was a wonderful wife.
