Long ago, in a great battle, a brave warrior named Arjuna felt sad.  He talked to his charioteer, Krishna, who was actually a god!

Krishna said, "Arjuna, I am the source of everything!  Even the gods and wise people don't fully understand me. I'm like the sun, the source of all light.  If you know me, you'll be free from worries and sadness."

Krishna explained how he was in everything:  the good things and the bad things, like happiness and sadness, life and death.  He said he was the creator of all the great wise people and even the gods themselves!

Krishna said, "I am in the sun, the moon, the wind, the trees, the animals, and even in you! I'm in every living thing. I am the beginning, the middle, and the end of everything."

He continued, naming many things he was: the best warrior, the greatest king, the wisest teacher, the bravest lion, and many more! He was part of everything good and strong in the world.  He is like the seed from which everything grows.

Arjuna was amazed.  He asked Krishna to tell him more.  Krishna said, "Arjuna, I am everywhere! I am the energy that holds the whole world together.  Knowing all this isn’t really important. Just know that I am with you."

Arjuna felt much better after hearing Krishna’s words. He understood that even though everything seems scary and difficult, Krishna, the great God, was everywhere, supporting and protecting everything.
