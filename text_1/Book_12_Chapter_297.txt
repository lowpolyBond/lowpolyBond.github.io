King Janaka was curious. He asked the wise Parasara, "Why are people different colors?  Everyone is said to come from the Brahmanas, the first people, so why aren't we all the same?"

Parasara explained, "It's true, everyone comes from the same source. But sometimes people stop doing good things. This is why we have different groups." He told a story:  "When the world was new, the great Lord created people. Some came from his mouth – these are the Brahmanas, the teachers and wise people.  Others came from his arms – the Kshatriyas, the brave warriors.  Some came from his legs – the Vaisyas, the farmers and traders. And lastly, those from his feet are the Sudras, who help everyone else."  He added, "Other groups came from people mixing together."

King Janaka asked, "But if everyone comes from Brahmanas, why are there so many different groups of people?"

Parasara said, "Even if you're born into a lower group, if you're good and do many good deeds, you can become very wise and respected, just like many great saints." He named many wise people who were born in lower groups but became very important. "At first, there were only four main groups of families," Parasara said, "but over time, many more developed."

King Janaka then asked, "What should each group do? And what should everyone do?"

Parasara answered, "Brahmanas teach and help people. Kshatriyas protect everyone. Vaisyas grow food and trade. Sudras help the other groups. But everyone should be kind, not hurt others, be honest, and help their families.  Everyone should try to be good, and those who do good things will be happy, no matter their group."  He added that even Sudras could become very good people and achieve happiness.

King Janaka asked, "Does being born into a certain group make you bad, or is it what you *do* that matters?"

Parasara answered, "Both matter! But what you *do* is more important. A person born into a good family could still do bad things, and a person born into a low family can still be a very good person."

King Janaka asked, "What are good things to do that don't hurt anyone?"

Parasara said, "Let go of your worries about the world.  Be humble, control yourself, be smart, and do good things.  By doing good deeds and being honest, everyone can be happy, both now and forever."
