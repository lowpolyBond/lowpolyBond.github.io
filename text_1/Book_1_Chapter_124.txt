Once upon a time, King Pandu had two wives: Kunti and Madri.  Kunti had three sons already: Yudhishthira, Bhima, and Arjuna.  Dhritarashtra, Pandu's brother, also had one hundred sons!

Madri felt sad. She didn't have any children.  She spoke to Pandu secretly. "My husband," she said, "I'm happy for Kunti, but I wish I had children too."

Pandu loved Madri. He talked to Kunti.  "My dear Kunti," he said, "please help Madri have children. It would make me and everyone happy."

Kunti was kind. She told Madri, "Think of a god, and you might have a child like him!"

Madri thought of the twin gods, the Aswins.  Whoosh!  Suddenly, she had twin boys!  Their names were Nakula and Sahadeva.  A magical voice said, "These boys will be even more handsome and strong than the Aswins!"

Everyone was overjoyed!  Wise people from the mountains came to bless the children.  They gave them their names.

Later, Pandu asked Kunti to help Madri again. But Kunti said, "I already helped her once! I don't want her to have more children than me!"

So, Pandu had five amazing sons: Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva. They were strong, handsome, and very brave.  Along with Dhritarashtraâ€™s hundred sons, they grew up together, big and strong like beautiful lotus flowers.  They were the Pandavas and the Kauravas, and their story is one of adventure, bravery, and family!
