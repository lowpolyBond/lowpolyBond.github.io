Sanjaya said, "The battle began!  Arjun, a great warrior, fought bravely. He used his arrows to defeat many enemy soldiers.  The Kauravas, Duryodhana's army, fought hard too, even though many were dying. They wanted to win, no matter what!

The battle was huge!  Both sides fought and pushed back, then fought again.  So much dust flew up, it blocked out the sun! No one could see where they were going. They fought by their colors and shouts.  But both Arjun's army and Duryodhana's army were strong and held their ground.

Soldiers in chariots fought other chariot soldiers.  Elephant riders fought each other.  Soldiers on foot fought with swords and axes.  Everyone fought everyone!  It was very messy! The battlefield was full of broken weapons, dead soldiers, elephants and horses.  Blood covered the ground.  Eventually, the dust settled, and you could see where you were.

Then, Bhishma, Drona, and other powerful Kaurava warriors pushed back Arjun's army.  But then Bhima, Ghatotkacha, and other Pandava warriors fought back hard!  They were so strong, it looked like gods fighting demons!

Duryodhana himself joined the fight with many soldiers.  Arjun, furious, attacked.  Abhimanyu and Satyaki fought against Sakuni's soldiers.  The terrible battle began again!"
