Once upon a time, on a tall mountain, lived a wise teacher named Vyasa.  He taught his students, very smart kids who loved learning. Vyasa taught them the Vedas, which are like ancient, magical storybooks filled with wisdom.

After learning, the students were so happy! They hugged each other and said, "We'll always remember what our teacher taught us! We want to go down the mountain and share these stories with everyone!"

Vyasa smiled. "Go ahead," he said, "but remember, these stories are very special, and it's easy to misunderstand them."

The students bowed to their teacher and went down the mountain. They taught people about the Vedas, and everyone loved their stories. They lived happily and were very respected.

Vyasa stayed on the mountain, with only his son, Suka.  He was sad that the mountain felt quiet without the students' voices.  Then, a friend named Narada came to visit.

"The mountain is so quiet without the sound of the Vedas!" Narada said. "It's like the moon without its shine!"

Vyasa sighed. "I miss my students," he said. "What should I do?"

Narada said, "You should keep the stories alive by teaching them to your son."

Vyasa was happy! He and Suka started to tell the Vedas' stories out loud.  Their voices were loud and clear, like beautiful music.  

One day, a big, strong wind blew. Vyasa told Suka to stop. Suka was curious. "Why?" he asked.

Vyasa explained, "This wind shows it's not the right time to tell the stories."  He told Suka about different kinds of winds.  There were winds that made clouds, winds that made rain, and even winds that brought life and death.

Vyasa explained that the Vedas are like the wind, special and powerful, and sometimes they need to be quiet for a bit. When the wind stopped, Vyasa and Suka continued their stories, filling the world with wisdom and wonder again. Then Vyasa went to take a swim in the magical Ganga River.
