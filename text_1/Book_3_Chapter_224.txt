Once upon a time, there was a beautiful goddess named Swaha. She was married to a wise man.  Swaha loved Agni, the god of fire.  She disguised herself as a man and went to see Agni.

"Agni," she said, "I love you! Please marry me, or I will be very sad."

Agni was surprised. "How did you know I felt the same?" he asked.

Swaha smiled.  "Your friends told me," she replied.  "I must go back soon!"

Agni was happy. He married Swaha right away.  Swaha was clever. She knew people would be upset if they saw her with Agni. So she changed into a bird and flew away.

She flew to a tall, white mountain.  This mountain was guarded by scary snakes and monsters! Swaha climbed to the top.  She had something special â€“ Agni's magic. She put it into a sparkly lake.

She changed back into herself, and then into the other wise wives, and visited Agni again.  But she couldn't change into one special wife, Arundhati, because Arundhati was too good.

Swaha put Agni's magic in the lake six times.  Each time, it made a magical baby grow stronger! This baby had six faces, twelve ears, twelve eyes, twelve hands, and twelve feet!  His name was Skanda.

Skanda was very strong. He had a big bow and arrow and a loud roar that scared even the biggest snakes! He played on the mountaintop, and everyone was scared of him at first.  

But then, Skanda was kind. He helped the scared animals and people.  He even used his bow and arrow to fix a broken mountain! The mountain was so happy to be fixed that it went back to its place.

From that day on, people celebrated Skanda every month. He was a very special and powerful god!
