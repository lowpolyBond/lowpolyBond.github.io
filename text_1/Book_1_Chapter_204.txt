Once upon a time, Duryodhana, a very naughty prince, wanted to defeat his cousins, the Pandavas. He asked Karna, his friend, for advice.

Karna said, "Duryodhana, your sneaky plans won't work!  You tried to hurt the Pandavas when they were little, and you failed. Now they're all grown up and strong.  They have good luck on their side and want their kingdom back.  We can't trick them."

Karna explained, "We can't separate the Pandavas. They're all brothers, and they're all married to the same woman, Draupadi. They are very close!  And Krishna, their friend, will always help them.  She won't leave them, no matter what.  Even the king of Panchala, their friend, is too honest to betray them."

Karna then said, "The only way is to fight them!  We're stronger now.  Let's attack before their friends and army join them. Let's attack before Krishna and his powerful army arrive to help the Pandavas!  Great warriors like us should fight bravely! This is what great kings do.  We have to be strong and fight now.   Clever tricks wonâ€™t work. We must fight them to win!"

King Dhritarashtra, Duryodhana's father, was happy with Karna's brave words. He praised Karna for his cleverness and strength. Then Dhritarashtra called a meeting with his best advisors, including Bhishma, Drona, and Vidura. They were going to decide how to defeat the Pandavas.
