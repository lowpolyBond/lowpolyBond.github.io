Once upon a time, a wise king named Yudhishthira wanted to know why cow dung was considered so special.  His grandfather, Bhishma, told him a wonderful story.

The goddess Lakshmi, who is the goddess of wealth and beauty, visited a herd of cows.  She was so beautiful that the cows were amazed!  They asked, "Who are you, beautiful goddess?  Why are you so stunning?"

Lakshmi said, "I am Lakshmi, and I bring good luck!  Gods and goddesses are happy because they have me.  Anyone I'm with is lucky.  I want to stay with you cows!"

But the cows were a little shy. They said, "We’re already happy with how we look. We don't need you.  You’re a little too… well, popular."  They thought Lakshmi was too busy for them.

Lakshmi felt sad.  "Nobody wants me! Gods and other creatures work hard to get my blessing.  Why do you refuse me?" she cried.  She begged them, "Please, let me stay with you, even in a not-so-nice part of your bodies."

The kind cows thought for a moment.  They said, "Okay, Lakshmi. You can live in our urine and dung.  Those things are sacred too!"

Lakshmi was so happy!  "Thank you!" she said.  Then, she disappeared, but she promised to always be with them, in their dung.

Bhishma finished the story. "That’s why, my dear Yudhishthira, cow dung is considered holy.  It has the blessing of Lakshmi!" He smiled.  "Now, let me tell you more about how amazing cows are..."
