Once upon a time, a great king named Vrihadyumna was having a big religious ceremony.  He asked two brothers, Arvavasu and Paravasu, to help.  Their father, Raivya, stayed home with Paravasu's wife.

One night, Paravasu went home to see his wife.  It was very dark.  He saw something moving in the woods – something that looked like a deer.  He was sleepy and didn't see clearly.  Sadly, he shot an arrow, and it hit his own father!

Paravasu was very sorry. He buried his father and went back to the ceremony. He told his brother, "I accidentally killed our father!  You need to do something special to make things right." Arvavasu said, "I will do it for you."  He did a special prayer to make up for the mistake.

When Arvavasu returned, Paravasu was jealous. He told the king, "Don't let my brother help! He killed a holy man!" The king sent Arvavasu away.

Arvavasu was sad, but he did even more special prayers to the sun god. The sun god was happy and helped him.  The gods were pleased with Arvavasu’s goodness. They made him the main helper at the ceremony, and they sent Paravasu away.

The gods even brought Raivya, Paravasu’s father, back to life!  They brought another man, Yavakri, back to life too.  The gods told Yavakri that he shouldn't be sad because he learned magic easily. Raivya had worked hard for his magic.

After this, the gods went back to heaven, leaving Arvavasu to live happily.  The place where this all happened became a special and holy place.
