Once upon a time, in a great battle, Nakula, a brave warrior, was hurt.  His chariot was broken, and his weapons were gone.

Eleven brave warriors, including five strong brothers and Draupadi's five sons, rushed to help in their fast chariots.  They fought bravely, shooting arrows like flying snakes.  They attacked the enemy elephants and chariots.

The Kaurava warriors, like Duryodhana and his friends, fought back hard.  Then, the Kulindas, riding big elephants, joined the fight.  These elephants were huge and strong, like moving mountains!

The Kulinda prince fought bravely but was hurt and fell. His brother fought, too, but the Gandharva king cut off his head.  The Kaurava warriors cheered, and the battle raged on.  It was a terrible fight!  Elephants, horses, and soldiers fell everywhere.

The battle was so fierce; it looked like a stormy sky with thunder and lightning!  Many more warriors fought and fell. A Kulinda prince even tried to hurt Duryodhana, but Duryodhana fought back and the prince fell.  Another Kulinda prince fought Kratha, but Kratha won. Vrika fought bravely, but was crushed by a big elephant. Another prince fought, but was hurt and fell. Another Kulinda prince attacked Shakuni but was killed.  Satanika, Nakula's son, fought bravely but was hurt.

Then, Karna’s son, Vrishasena, showed off his strength!  He shot many arrows at the Pandavas. The Kauravas cheered, but Arjuna, who was very strong, knew that Vrishasena was no match for him.

Arjuna saw his friend Nakula hurt, and he was very angry.  He decided to defeat Vrishasena.  Arjuna fought fiercely, like a storm.  He shot many arrows and cut off Vrishasena’s arms, bow, and head! Vrishasena fell from his chariot.

Karna, Vrishasena's father, was heartbroken and furious.  He was so angry that he charged at Arjuna and Krishna, ready for a new battle!
