Once upon a time, in a great battle, lots of brave warriors fought!  Sanjaya, a wise man, told the story.

Drona’s son was a super strong fighter. He defeated many soldiers, including the sons of Drupada and Kuntibhoja, even some scary Rakshasas!  Yudhishthira, Bhima, Dhrishtadyumna, and Satyaki fought bravely on the other side.  They were determined to win.

Somadatta got really angry when he saw Satyaki. He shot tons of arrows at him!  A big, exciting fight began. Bhima helped Satyaki, hitting Somadatta with arrows. Somadatta fought back hard. Then Satyaki shot a powerful arrow, and Bhima threw a huge weapon called a Parigha.  Both hit Somadatta at the same time, and he fell down!

Somadatta’s father, Valhika, was furious. He attacked Satyaki with a flurry of arrows. Bhima stepped in again, hitting Valhika with many arrows. But Valhika threw a strong spear at Bhima, making him fall!  Bhima got back up quickly and threw his mace.  It hit Valhika, and he fell dead.

Ten strong warriors, all as brave as Rama, then attacked Bhima!  Bhima was very angry. He shot ten arrows, one at each warrior, and they all fell.  Then Bhima attacked Karna's friend, but Karna’s brother, Vrikaratha, fought back. Bhima defeated him too!  He also beat many more of the enemy’s soldiers, including Satachandra.

Five more warriors jumped in to fight Bhima, but he quickly defeated them all with just five arrows! Many enemy soldiers got scared and started to run away.

Yudhishthira also fought very bravely! He defeated many soldiers from different kingdoms, making the ground bloody.  People shouted, "Kill! Grab! Capture! Hit!"

Drona, a powerful warrior, and his son tried to stop Yudhishthira.  They threw magical weapons at him, but Yudhishthira was so skillful, he blocked every one!  They used even more powerful weapons, but Yudhishthira was still too strong!  Everyone cheered!

Drona then attacked the Panchala soldiers. They ran away, but Bhima and Arjuna stopped them. Then there was another big fight, with many soldiers from both sides.  Arjuna and Bhima fought so well that the enemy army began to run away, even Drona and the king’s son couldn't stop them.
