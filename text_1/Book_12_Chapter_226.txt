Long ago, in a land far away, a powerful being named Indra met a sad Asura named Namuchi. Namuchi had lost everything.  He was poor and defeated.

Indra asked Namuchi, "You've lost your power and wealth. Are you sad?"

Namuchi smiled. "Being sad doesn't help," he said. "It only makes me feel worse.  Sadness can't be shared. It's like trying to carry a heavy rock all by yourself."

"Everything ends eventually," Namuchi explained. "Sadness only makes things worse.  It hurts my health, my happiness, even my good character! Instead, I focus on doing good things. When we focus on what's good, things usually work out well."

Namuchi believed in a powerful Creator who decides everything.  "The Creator guides my life," he said, "like a stream flowing downhill. I know what life and freedom are, but I don't worry about getting freedom right now. I just do what's right and wrong, and let the Creator guide me."

He continued, "The Creator decides what happens to us.  We get what's meant for us. We go where we're meant to go. We feel happy or sad as the Creator plans. It's not our choice!"

Namuchi said, "Wise people don't get upset by good or bad things. They stay calm like a strong mountain. They don't get angry easily. They don't worry about what they have or don't have.  They accept what life brings."

He added, "Even great people face hard times. But those who understand themselves don't fear. We should always be cheerful, no matter what happens.  A good meeting of wise people makes even bad people feel afraid of doing wrong."

"The wisest people are hard to understand," Namuchi said. "Even if bad things happen, like getting old, they don't give up. We can't get things we're not meant to get, no matter how hard we try. So there is no need to be sad about it."

"My life is already planned," Namuchi said. "I'm just following that plan. Even death can't change that!  A truly wise person is happy and calm, no matter what happens."
