Once upon a time, King Kusika woke up early.  He and his queen went to a forest.  There, they saw a beautiful palace!  It was made of gold, with shiny gem columns.  It looked like a magical palace!

The palace was surrounded by pretty hills, lakes with lotus flowers, and amazing gardens.  There were so many colorful flowers – more than you could ever imagine!  There were also happy birds singing everywhere, like parrots, peacocks, and many more.  Friendly monkeys swung through the trees.  Even magical fairies, called Apsaras, and Gandharvas (like musical gods) were dancing and singing!

King Kusika was amazed! He wondered, "Is this a dream?  Am I in heaven?"  He thought it might be the magical land of the Uttara-Kurus, or even the home of the gods!

Then, he saw a wise man, Rishi Chyavana, resting on a bed inside the golden palace.  As the King approached, the palace and everything magical disappeared!  Poof!  The forest was just a normal forest again, with grass and anthills.

King Kusika was very surprised. He knew this amazing sight was all thanks to Rishi Chyavana's magic, which came from his hard work and prayers.  He told his queen, “See how powerful prayer is! It can create anything!”

Chyavana appeared again. He praised the king for being so respectful and kind.  He told the king, "You passed a big test! You are a good and pure person.” He then gave the King a blessing.  King Kusika was very happy. He had seen a miracle and learned a valuable lesson about the power of prayer. He had a very special day!
