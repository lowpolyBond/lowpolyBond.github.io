Narada, a wise and traveling sage, showed Matali, Indra's charioteer, a magnificent city.  "Look!" he said, "This is Hiranyapura, a dazzling city of the Asuras! It's full of magic and tricks!"

It was built by Maya, a clever Danava, deep underground.  Many powerful Asuras lived there. They had magic powers and were impossible to beat!  Even Indra, the king of the gods, and his friends couldn't defeat them.

The city was amazing!  Houses were made of gold and silver, sparkling with jewels like rubies, sapphires, and diamonds. They shone like the sun!  The buildings were tall and close together, all beautiful and mysterious. There were magical trees with any fruit you could wish for, and fountains that flowed with water.

"Matali," Narada said, "We're looking for a husband for you. Perhaps there’s a nice Asura here who would be a good match?”

Matali shook his head. "The gods and the Asuras are always fighting," he said. "I can't marry one of our enemies! Let's go somewhere else."

Narada smiled. "You’re right," he said, "I just love to stir things up!"  And so they flew off to find a different place to look for a husband for Matali.
