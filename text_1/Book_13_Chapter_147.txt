Once upon a time, some wise holy men asked a powerful god,  "Oh great god, we want to hear about Vasudeva!"

The powerful god answered, "Vasudeva, also called Krishna, is amazing! He's even greater than the very oldest god. He’s like a second sun, shining brightly, with ten strong arms. He helps the good gods win against bad guys.  He has a special mark on his chest and curly hair.  All the other gods look up to him.  He's so important that the oldest god came from his belly, I came from his head, and all the stars came from his hair! All the gods and even the bad guys came from his body!  He made the whole Earth and rules everything, even the sky and underworld. He can do anything, he knows everything, and he's everywhere!  He’s the greatest of all, the boss of all the gods, and he can defeat any enemy."

The god continued, "Krishna is super strong and kind. He has a special bow and a spinning weapon called a discus. A giant eagle sits on his flag.  He's very handsome, brave, and always does the right thing. He has a thousand eyes!  He’s loved by everyone and forgives others easily. He helps everyone, even his enemies.  He’s incredibly wise and knows all the rules. He will be reborn as a human to help the gods."

Then the god explained how Krishna would be born. He told a long story about many kings and queens, going back generations, until finally, Krishna was born to Devaki and Vasudeva.  Krishna would be a great king, a powerful fighter, and would help everyone. He would even rescue many kings held captive!

The god said, "To see me or the oldest god, you must first see Krishna!  He is like us.  If you make him happy, you make us all happy.  He's the best protector. Worship him, and you’ll be rewarded! He’s like the sun, always shining, always helping others.”

The god also talked about Krishna’s older brother, Baladeva, who was also incredibly strong. He had a plough for a weapon and was as tall as a mountain!

Finally, the god said, "Krishna is the greatest of all. He is everywhere and always helps everyone. Show him respect, and you will be blessed!"
