King Janamejaya asked a wise Brahmin, "I've heard stories about my ancestors, but I want to hear the whole story, from the very beginning!  Tell me about Manu, the first man, and all the kings who came after him."

The Brahmin, Vaisampayana, said, "Okay, I will tell you the amazing story of your family, just as I heard it from another wise man."

He began:  Daksha had a daughter named Aditi. Aditi had a son named Vivaswat. Vivaswat had a son named Manu. Manu had a son named Ila, who had a son named Pururavas.  Pururavas had many sons and grandsons, including Yayati.

Yayati had two wives.  One wife, Devayani, had sons named Yadu and Turvasu.  His other wife, Sarmishtha, had sons named Druhyu, Anu, and Puru.  The descendants of Yadu became the Yadavas, and the descendants of Puru became the Pauravas – your family!

Puru’s line continued for many generations.  There were kings who were strong and brave, who fought many battles, and who performed amazing sacrifices.  Kings like Janamejaya (who performed three great sacrifices!), Prachinwat (who ruled the whole east!), and many more. The story went on and on, with kings marrying princesses and having sons, and those sons becoming kings themselves.

Finally, the Brahmin told the story of Santanu, a kind king who made even old people feel young again.  Santanu married Ganga, and they had a son, Devavrata, who became the great warrior Bhishma.  Santanu then married Satyavati, who had a son named Vyasa, a very wise man.

Vyasa helped Santanu's sons, Chitrangada and Vichitravirya, by helping them have children.  Sadly, both Chitrangada and Vichitravirya died.  Vyasa then helped perpetuate the family by having three sons with Satyavati: Dhritarashtra, Pandu, and Vidura.

Dhritarashtra had many sons, including the powerful Duryodhana.  Pandu had two wives, Kunti and Madri, and they had five amazing sons: Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva. These are the famous Pandavas!

The Pandavas and the Kauravas (Dhritarashtra's sons) had many adventures, including a time when they were almost killed.  The Pandavas married and had their own sons.  Abhimanyu, one of Arjuna's sons, had a son who was almost killed but was saved. This son was Parikshit.  Parikshit's son was your father, and you are King Janamejaya!

The Brahmin finished, "This is the story of your family, a long and amazing history filled with heroes and battles, love and loss. This story is very important, and everyone should hear it!"
