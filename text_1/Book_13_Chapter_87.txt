Yudhishthira, a very good king, asked Bhishma, a wise old man, about a special ceremony called a Sraddha.  This ceremony is to honor his ancestors, the people who came before him.

Bhishma said, "This Sraddha is very important! It's like a special gift to show respect to our ancestors. Everyone – gods, people, and even magical creatures – should honor their ancestors. We should always remember them."

Bhishma explained that the best time to do a Sraddha is on the afternoon of the new moon. But, doing it on other days is okay too. He then told Yudhishthira about what good things might happen if you do the Sraddha on different days of the month:

* **First day:** Beautiful and loving spouses and lots of children!
* **Second day:** Many daughters.
* **Third day:** Many fast horses.
* **Fourth day:** Lots of sheep and goats.
* **Fifth day:** Many sons.
* **Sixth day:**  Becoming very important and famous!
* **Seventh day:**  Becoming very famous.
* **Eighth day:**  Being very successful in business.
* **Ninth day:** Many strong cows and oxen.
* **Tenth day:** A lot of wealth and many cows.
* **Eleventh day:** Lots of beautiful clothes and shiny things, and many clever sons.
* **Twelfth day:** Seeing lots of wonderful gold and silver things.
* **Thirteenth day:** Becoming the most important person in your family.
* **Fourteenth day:**  This day is unlucky for the Sraddha! It can bring sadness and war.
* **New Moon day:**  All your wishes will come true!

Bhishma said the best time to do the Sraddha is in the second half of the dark part of the month (after the full moon). The afternoon is better than the morning.  It's a very special and important ceremony to show respect for those who came before us.
