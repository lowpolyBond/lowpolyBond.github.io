Rama, a very good prince, was ready to go to the forest.  He said goodbye to his mom and walked through the busy streets. Everyone felt calm when they saw him.

His wife, Sita, was very happy. She thought Rama was going to be king soon! She was praying and getting ready for the big day.

Rama came to the palace.  He wasn't dressed like a king. He was simple.

Sita was scared when she saw him.  She asked, "Rama, what's wrong? Today's the day you become king!  Where are the fancy clothes, the beautiful decorations, and the happy music?"

Rama was sad. He told Sita, "My father made me go live in the forest for fourteen years. My stepmother, Kaikeyi, asked for this as a gift a long time ago.  My brother Bharata will be king instead."

Rama explained that he had to leave. He told Sita to be kind to Bharata, the new king.  He said, "Be good to my mom and my other brothers.  Obey Bharata, and be happy. When I leave, dressed like a forest person, you should stop wearing nice clothes too."

Sita was very sad, but she promised to listen to Rama.  He went to the forest, and Sita stayed behind, missing him very much.
