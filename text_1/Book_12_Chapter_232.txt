Once upon a time, before everything existed, there was only Brahma, a powerful being like a super-superhero!  Brahma woke up one day and decided to create the world.

First, he made something called Mahat.  Mahat quickly changed into Mind, which is like the boss of all things.  Mind, wanting to create more, made seven important things:  Space, Wind, Light, Water, and Earth.

Space was the first. It had sound. Then came Wind, which smelled nice and also had sound and touch. Next was Light, which was shiny and had sound, touch, and shape. Water came after, with taste added to sound, touch, and shape.  Finally, Earth was created, smelling great and having sound, touch, shape, taste, and smell.

All these things mixed together to make bodies for living creatures – people, animals, and everything else! Then Brahma, the superhero creator, put a tiny part of himself inside each body. That's how he watched over everything.  He made mountains, rivers, trees, and all the animals.  He made good creatures and bad creatures, small ones and big ones.

Some people think we do things because we try hard, others think it's destiny, and others think it's just our nature.  But really, it's a bit of all three working together.  Brahma is the reason for all of it!

Brahma also made the Vedas, holy books filled with wisdom.  The Vedas taught people how to live a good life and how to become even wiser.  They taught about being peaceful and doing good deeds.  Being good and thoughtful is super important!  It can help you get what you want.

Brahma's creations change over time.  There are different ages, and each age has different ways of life. In one age, people were very peaceful and wise, In another, they needed to follow rules more closely.  But just like the seasons change and then come back again, so too do the ages and the ways people live.

Brahma is like the clockwork of the universe – he creates everything and keeps it all going, and Time itself is part of this amazing clockwork!

So, that’s the story of how the world began, according to Brahma! It’s a big story, but that’s because the universe is big and amazing!
