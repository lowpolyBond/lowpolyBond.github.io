Once upon a time, during a big war, there was a great warrior named Drona. He fought in a chariot pulled by red horses.  Drona was super strong and a really good archer. He shot lots of arrows with amazing speed, hitting many enemy soldiers.

One day, a brave warrior named Vrihatkshatra attacked Drona.  Vrihatkshatra was also a great archer, and he shot many arrows back at Drona! They shot arrows back and forth – it was like a huge arrow storm!

Drona then used a super special, magic weapon called Brahmastra!  But Vrihatkshatra had one too, and he blocked Drona's magic!  They kept fighting, shooting arrows until Drona finally hit Vrihatkshatra, and he fell from his chariot.

Next, another brave warrior, Dhrishtaketu, charged at Drona.  Dhrishtaketu was very strong, and he hit Drona's chariot and horses with lots of arrows. Drona was clever, though! He broke Dhrishtaketu’s bow, but Dhrishtaketu grabbed another and kept fighting.  Drona cleverly defeated him too.


Then, the son of Jarasandha attacked. He shot so many arrows, it was hard to see Drona! But Drona was too strong, and he defeated him as well.

Drona was so good at fighting, he defeated many, many soldiers.  The enemy army was scared! They yelled, “Drona is too strong! He’s unbeatable!”

Finally, another brave warrior named Kshatradharman, tried to fight Drona.  He broke Drona's bow! But Drona got a new one and defeated him too.  Even a brave warrior named Chekitana couldn’t defeat Drona.  Drona fought like a young man, even though he was very old! Everyone was amazed by his strength and skill.

The enemy army was very worried.  Their leader, Drupada, said,  "Drona is too strong! We need to stop him!" Then, Drupada and his best warriors planned a new strategy to fight Drona.
