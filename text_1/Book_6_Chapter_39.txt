Imagine a giant upside-down tree, a special tree called the Aswattha.  Its roots are way up high, in the sky!  Its branches reach down to Earth.  The leaves are like stories from holy books.  If you understand this tree, you understand everything!

The branches spread out, like a big, strong tree.  They have different parts, just like we have different things we like to do.  The roots go deep down, into the world, where we do things.

It's a magical tree, you can't see its start or end.  It's very hard to understand.  But, if you try really hard to not be bothered by things in this world, you can find a special place. It’s like going home to a wonderful, safe place where you are always happy.  It’s a place where the sun, moon and fire don’t even shine! Nobody ever leaves that place. That's my special home.

A little part of me lives in everyone, like a tiny seed. It's what makes you, YOU. This tiny seed is connected to your eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin, and to your mind. When you are born, this tiny seed comes to live in your body.  And when you die, it goes back home.  It's like the wind carrying away smells.

Some people can see this little part of me, but some can’t.  It’s only the ones with wisdom who can really see it.

I shine brightly in the sun, the moon, and the fire. I give strength to the earth, and help plants grow.  I'm even inside you, making you grow and helping you digest your food! I live in everyone's heart.  I help you remember things, and I help you learn. I am the one who created all the holy books.

There are two worlds: the world that changes, which is everything you see, and the world that never changes.  But there's also me – the greatest of all! I’m everywhere in the whole universe. I’m even bigger than the world that never changes. That's why everyone calls me the Highest Being. If you understand me, you will understand everything, and you'll live a good life!  This is a very important secret, and now you know it! Knowing this will make you very wise.
