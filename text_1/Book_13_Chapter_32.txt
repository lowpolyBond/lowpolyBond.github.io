Once upon a time, a brave king named Vrishadarbha ruled the land.  Yudhishthira, a very wise prince, wanted to know about being good and kind. He asked his grandfather, Bhishma, a very, very wise man, about helping others.

Bhishma told a story: A scared little pigeon was flying when a big hawk chased it. The pigeon was so frightened, it flew down and hid in King Vrishadarbha's lap!  The kind king said, "Don't worry, little bird! You're safe with me!" He petted the pigeon gently.

The hawk swooped down and said, "That pigeon is my dinner! You can't stop me!"  The king felt bad for both the pigeon and the hungry hawk.

The hawk explained, "I need to eat.  I’m very hungry!"

The king tried to be fair.  He offered the hawk a big, juicy bull, a pig, a deer – anything the hawk liked. But the hawk said, "I only eat pigeons. That's what hawks eat!"

The hawk then made a strange request:  "Give me a piece of your own flesh, the same weight as the pigeon."

The king agreed! He took his own knife and started cutting pieces of his own body to weigh against the pigeon. His queens and servants cried.  The sky turned dark and the earth shook! But the king kept cutting,  until he was just skin and bones.  Even then, the pigeon was still heavier.  Finally, the king got on the scale himself!

Suddenly, amazing things happened!  Gods and goddesses from the sky appeared.  They showered him with flowers and sweet nectar, because he was so selfless.  King Vrishadarbha rode away on a beautiful, magical chariot to heaven!

Bhishma told Yudhishthira, "Helping others, even when it's hard, is the best thing you can do.  King Vrishadarbha was a great example of kindness and bravery. If you listen to his story, you will be a better person, too!"
