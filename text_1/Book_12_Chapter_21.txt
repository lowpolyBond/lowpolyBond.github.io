Once upon a time, in the land of the Mahabharata, a wise teacher named Devasthana told a story.  He said, "Long ago, King Indra asked the wise Vrihaspati, 'What is the best way to live?'"

Vrihaspati smiled. "The best thing is to be happy with what you have," he said. "Being content is like finding the greatest treasure.  Imagine a turtle pulling its legs in – that’s what it’s like to let go of wanting things you don’t need.  When you’re not scared of anyone, and no one is scared of you, and you don't let your likes and dislikes control you, then you’ve found your true self!"

Vrihaspati continued, "If you are kind in your thoughts and words, and you don’t wish harm on anyone, you are close to the highest good.  People find happiness in different ways. Some like quiet time, others like being busy. Some like to give things away, others like to receive. Some pray; others meditate. Some are kings, ruling kindly and fairly. Some live simply in the woods. But the wisest people agree: the best way is to never hurt anyone."

He went on, “Being honest, kind, fair, and self-controlled is very important.  Raising a family, being friendly, and being patient are also good.  This is what the great teacher Manu taught.  A good king is fair to everyone. He rules justly, protects the innocent, and helps those in need.  He even gives up his throne eventually to live simply and peacefully. This is how he becomes happy both in this life and the next."

Getting to the best place after we die is very hard, Vrihaspati explained.  But if you are kind, helpful, and don't let anger or wanting things control you, you'll be closer to it. Even great gods and kings live this way. So, by being good and kind, we can all live a happy life and reach the best place in the end.
