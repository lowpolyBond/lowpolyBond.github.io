Nakula, Arjuna's brother, spoke to King Yudhishthira.  He looked serious, like a copper statue.  He said, "Arjuna, even the gods do good deeds! They offer gifts and pray.  Even the ancestors who send rain do good deeds.  People who ignore these good deeds are like people who don't believe in sharing."

"Following the teachings of the wise people, doing good deeds, and giving to others leads to a wonderful place after death. The best way to live is a family life, where you can help others.  Giving your hard-earned riches to wise people is the best kind of giving.  It is better than running away to the forest to become a hermit."

Nakula explained, "True hermits live simply and quietly, studying, being kind, and not getting angry or upset.  But simply living in the woods doesn't make someone a good person. People who just want to escape their problems aren’t truly good. It’s better to live at home, helping others, and giving what you have."

"Giving to others is important. That’s how we honor the gods and our ancestors," Nakula continued. "Living at home, doing good things for your family and community, is the best way to live.  A true hero isn't someone who hides in the forest – it’s someone who helps everyone, shares their wealth, and does great things!"

"You, Yudhishthira, are a great warrior. You fought bravely, now share your winnings.  Give gifts, help people, and do important ceremonies. Don’t be sad; be proud of what you’ve done. You'll go to a wonderful place after life! Don't waste your time feeling sorry for yourself!"
