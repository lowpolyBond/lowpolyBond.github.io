Once upon a time, in a great battle, a powerful warrior named Drona fought for the Kauravas.  He was incredibly strong, and he defeated many Panchala soldiers.  He was like a super-strong superhero, defeating everyone!

The Pandavas, who were fighting against Drona, were scared.  They saw their friends falling, and they felt hopeless.  They whispered to each other, "Drona is too strong!  He'll defeat us all!"

Krishna, a wise and clever friend of the Pandavas, had a plan.  He knew Drona loved his son, Aswatthaman, very much.  Krishna told the Pandavas, "If we trick Drona into thinking Aswatthaman is dead, he'll stop fighting."

Bhima, a very strong Pandava, found a big elephant also named Aswatthaman. He quickly defeated the elephant, then shouted to Drona, "Aswatthaman is dead!"

Drona was very sad when he heard this, but he wasn't completely sure it was true. He needed to know for sure.

The Pandavas were worried, but Krishna said, "Itâ€™s okay to tell a little white lie to save everyone!"

Yudhishthira, the Pandava king, was known for always telling the truth. But because he was worried, he told Drona, "Aswatthaman is dead," even though he knew it wasn't totally true. It was a trick to save everyone.

When Drona heard this from the always truthful king Yudhishthira, he felt heartbroken and stopped fighting.  He was so upset that he let his guard down.  This allowed Dhrishtadyumna to defeat him.

Even though Yudhishthira told a little lie, it was all part of a plan to help his friends and win the battle.  It wasn't easy, but in the end, they managed to defeat the very powerful Drona.
