Once upon a time, after the Pandava brothers went to live in the forest, their uncle, King Dhritarashtra, was very sad.  He was blind, but he was wise. He went to his wise advisor, Vidura, and said, "Vidura, you're so smart!  What should I do?  My sons, the Kauravas, have done bad things. How can I keep our kingdom safe?"

Vidura said, "King, a kingdom is strong when its ruler is good. Your sons did wrong by cheating the Pandavas in a game.  To make things right, give the Pandavas back what belongs to them. A good king is happy with what he has and doesn't want what others have. Thatâ€™s the best way to be."

Vidura continued, "The Pandavas are strong warriors.  Arjuna is a great archer, Bhima is super strong. If they're angry, they'll be very hard to stop!  Let the Pandavas rule fairly with your sons.  Make them apologize for their bad actions. Please, give the throne back to Yudhishthira, the eldest Pandava brother.  This is the only way to save our kingdom and our family!"

But King Dhritarashtra didn't like what Vidura said. He loved his son, Duryodhana, very much, even though Duryodhana was mean. "Vidura," he said, "You're talking about my sons, but you only care about the Pandavas! How can I give up my own son? He's part of me! Your advice is bad.  I don't want to listen anymore!"

The king got up and left. Vidura sighed and said, "Our family is going to have big trouble." Then he went to find the Pandava brothers.
