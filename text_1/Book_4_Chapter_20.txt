Draupadi was very sad.  She was hiding in the king's palace.  She wasn't a princess anymore; she was a servant named Sairindhri, all because of a bad game of dice her husband had lost.

"Oh, Bhima," she cried, "I'm so unhappy!  I'm waiting for better times.  Sometimes things are good, sometimes they're bad. It's like a spinning wheel!  Good luck and bad luck go round and round. I hope good luck will come back to my husbands soon.  Even people who win can lose later.  That's just how life is.  Why don't you think of me as already dead?"

Draupadi explained that even people who are generous can become beggars, and those who defeat others can be defeated themselves.  Fate is powerful, and nobody can control it completely.  "It's like a dry pond," she said, "it can fill up again! I'm hoping for good times to return."

"Oh, Bhima," she continued, "this is all so shameful! My sadness has shamed my family, my father’s family, and my husband’s family. I have so many brothers, a father-in-law, and sons, yet I am so unhappy. Maybe I did something wrong when I was little that is causing this.  Look at my hands! They’re all rough and sore from working. I never had to work like this before.  I was happy then. Now I'm a servant, afraid of the queen!"

Draupadi showed Bhima her calloused hands.  "I used to be a princess," she said, "but now I have to work for the queen. I am a slave.  I am afraid to even make a mistake in preparing her unguents, because this queen is very difficult!"

Draupadi started to cry.  Seeing her so sad, Bhima covered his face with her hands and started to cry too.  He held her hands and cried, heartbroken for his wife.  He knew how much she had suffered.
