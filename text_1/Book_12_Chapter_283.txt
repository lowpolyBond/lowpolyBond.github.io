Once upon a time, a prince named Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, a question.  He wanted to know about Fever.  Yudhishthira had heard that Fever made a powerful demon named Vritra weak, so he could be defeated.

Bhishma told him a story.  Long ago, on a beautiful mountain called Meru, lived a powerful god named Mahadeva.  Lots of important people lived with him: other gods, magical beings, and even a river named Ganga!  It was a very grand place.

One day, another god named Daksha had a big party.  All the gods went, except Mahadeva. He wasn't invited to share the food!  His wife, Uma, was very sad.  Mahadeva got angry. He went to Daksha's party and stopped it!

Mahadeva was so angry, a drop of sweat fell from his forehead.  The drop landed on the ground and BOOM!  A scary, fiery monster appeared.  This monster was very strong and burned everything it touched. It even chased the other gods away!

Another even more powerful god, Brahman, saw what was happening. He told Mahadeva to calm down and share the food at parties. He also said the monster needed to be split into many smaller parts.  Mahadeva did this. He spread the monster into tiny bits:  the heat in an elephant's head, the sickness in a horse's throat, and lots of other little problems.  These tiny bits of the monster were now called Fever!

So, Bhishma explained to Yudhishthira that Fever is a tiny bit of Mahadeva's anger.  It makes people sick.  But it is only a small part of the very powerful god.  Knowing this story, Bhishma said, would keep you healthy and happy.  So Yudhishthira learned all about Fever and how it was connected to a big, angry god's sweat!
