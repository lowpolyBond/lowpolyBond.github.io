King Dhritarashtra talked to Yudhishthira.  "Yudhishthira, before you go to war, think carefully about peace and war.  There are many ways to do both.  Think about your own strengths and weaknesses.

Don't attack an enemy who has happy, healthy soldiers and is very smart.  Instead, find a way to beat them when they are weak.  Attack when they are unhappy or their soldiers are sick.  When you win, don't stay and fight.  Go back to safety. Then, make your enemy's life difficult.  Make their friends fight against them. Scare them!  Make their army weaker.

A good king knows about different kinds of power. He needs money, friends to help him, forest people, soldiers, and workers. Friends and money are the most important. Spies are also very helpful!  Bad things can happen, like accidents or problems.  You must be ready for them. Always try to make peace first.

If you have a strong army, go to war at the right time and place.  But only go if your soldiers are happy and healthy!  Make your army like a powerful river.  The soldiers are the mud, the horses and chariots are the water, and the flags are the trees. Use clever battle formations to win.

Use spies to learn about your enemy.  Then, fight either on your land or on theirs.  Always keep your soldiers happy. Send your best warriors first. Know what is happening in your kingdom, and try to make peace if you can.  Protect yourself and do what is good. A good king does what's right and takes care of his people. He will go to heaven after he dies! You have learned from wise people. I want to help you too. Be a good king, and your people will love you. Youâ€™ll be happy here and in heaven!"
