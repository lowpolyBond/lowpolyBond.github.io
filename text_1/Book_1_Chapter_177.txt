Once upon a time, a great warrior named Viswamitra was hunting. He got very tired and thirsty.  He found himself at the home of a wise holy man, Vasishtha.

Vasishtha was kind. He welcomed Viswamitra.  He had a magical cow named Nandini!  Nandini gave anything you asked for!  She gave delicious food, fruits, milk, and even beautiful jewels and clothes. Viswamitra was amazed!

Viswamitra loved Nandini. He wanted her. He offered Vasishtha his whole kingdom or ten thousand cows for Nandini.

But Vasishtha said, "No! Nandini is special. She's for the gods and guests."

Viswamitra was angry.  He said, "I'm a powerful king! I'll take her!" He tried to steal Nandini.

Nandini cried. She was scared and hurt. She asked Vasishtha for help.

Vasishtha was a peaceful man. He said, "I believe in forgiveness. If you want to go, Nandini, you may go."

But Nandini said, "If you don't tell me to leave, I can't be taken by force!"

Suddenly, Nandini was very angry! Her eyes flashed red.  She stamped her feet!  She even breathed fire!  Amazingly, soldiers jumped out from her tail, her udders, her mouth, even her poop!  They were from faraway lands.

These soldiers fought Viswamitra's army!  Viswamitra's soldiers were scared and ran away! They ran for miles and miles!

Viswamitra was surprised. He realized that Vasishthaâ€™s peaceful power was much stronger than his own. He was ashamed. He gave up being a king. He became a holy man himself, just like Vasishtha! He learned that true strength is not in fighting, but in peace and kindness.
