King Dhritarashtra asked Bhishma for advice.  Bhishma said, "King, I don't think we should fight the Pandavas.  They are like family to me, just like your sons.  They deserve their share of the kingdom just as much as your sons do.

Let's make a deal. Let's give the Pandavas half the kingdom.  It's their rightful inheritance, just like it is Duryodhanaâ€™s. If the Pandavas don't get their half, how can anyone else truly own the whole kingdom? They deserve it as much as anyone.

Giving them half is the best thing for everyone. If we don't, it will bring shame on us all.  A good name is more important than anything! People remember you for your good deeds, not bad ones.  A person lives on through their good reputation, even after they're gone.

Duryodhana, do what our ancestors would have done. We are so lucky the Pandavas survived the fire!  Purochana tried to kill them, but he failed. The world blames you more than Purochana for what happened!  The Pandavas are alive, and nothing can stop them from getting their rightful share of the kingdom. They are good, strong, and they stick together.

So please, do what is right. Do what makes everyone happy.  Give the Pandavas half the kingdom."
