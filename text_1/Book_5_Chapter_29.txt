Krishna spoke to Sanjaya, his friend.  "I want the Pandavas, the five brothers, to be safe and happy," he said. "I also want King Dhritarashtra and his many sons to be well.  I've always hoped for peace between them."

Krishna thought the Pandavas were very peaceful. But the Kauravas, Dhritarashtra's sons, were greedy.  "Why should there be a war?" Krishna asked Sanjaya. "You know right from wrong as well as I do, or even Yudhishthira, the eldest Pandava. Why do you blame him? He's always been good to his family."

Krishna explained that even wise people disagreed about what was best. Some said good things happened because of hard work. Others said knowing the truth was enough.  "But," Krishna said, "you can't be hungry and just *know* about food. You have to eat!  Work is important.  The sun rises every day, the rain falls, the earth holds us up – all because of work!"

He told Sanjaya about powerful gods: Indra, the king of the gods, worked hard to become powerful. Vrihaspati, the teacher of the gods, worked hard too.  "Even the stars and all the other gods, they got their power from working hard!" Krishna exclaimed.  "The Pandavas also work hard! Yudhishthira studies and learns, he’s ready to fight, and he wants peace, too!"

Krishna said, "If the Pandavas can avoid fighting, that's best. But if they have to fight to protect what’s right, even dying in battle would be honorable." He then explained the duties of each group of people:

* **Brahmins (priests):**  study, pray, give to others, and teach.
* **Kshatriyas (warriors):** protect people, be brave, give to others, and fight if necessary.
* **Vaishyas (merchants and farmers):** work hard, trade, and be fair.
* **Shudras (workers):** serve the others, work hard, and be honest.

The king, Krishna said, should protect everyone and make sure everyone does their job. A good king is fair and doesn’t want more than he needs. A bad king becomes greedy and starts wars.  "Indra even made weapons to fight bad people," Krishna said.  "It's right to fight for justice!"

The Kauravas, Krishna continued, had been very unfair to the Pandavas. They had stolen their land, and worse, they had been cruel to Draupadi, the Pandavas’ wife. They didn't stop Dushasana from embarrassing her, and Karna was especially mean to her.   "What's the difference between stealing secretly and stealing openly?" Krishna asked. "The Kauravas did both!"

Krishna said the Pandavas had a right to their kingdom. "It's better to die fighting for your family's land than to live without it," he said. "Tell the Kauravas this! Tell them to be fair. I hope they’ll listen. But if they don't, the Pandavas will fight, and the Kauravas will be defeated!"

Krishna used a powerful image to explain the situation.  He said the Kauravas were like a forest, and the Pandavas were the tigers protecting that forest.  "If you cut down the forest, you kill the tigers!  Let the tigers be safe in their forest."  He concluded, "The Pandavas are ready to talk. Let King Dhritarashtra make the right choice."
