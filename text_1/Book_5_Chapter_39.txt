King Dhritarashtra was worried.  He talked to his wise advisor, Vidura.  Dhritarashtra said, "We can't control what happens to us. It's like a puppet; someone else pulls the strings."

Vidura said, "King, you should have gotten rid of your son, Duryodhana, a long time ago.  He's causing trouble for your other sons.  It's better to lose a little to save a lot.  People like Duryodhana are only liked because they're rich, not because they're good."

Dhritarashtra agreed with Vidura, but he couldn't bring himself to abandon his son. He believed that good people always win.

Vidura explained, "Good people are kind to everyone.  Duryodhana and his friends are mean and only care about themselves.  Don't be friends with people like that!  Their friendships end badly. When things go well, they turn on their friends."

Vidura continued, "Be good to your other sons, the Pandavas. They're good people.  Give them a little land to live on. If you are kind to everyone, you will be a great king! You are old now. Control your sons!  Family should always help each other. Never fight with your family! They can make you very happy or very sad."

Vidura warned, "If you let Duryodhana hurt the Pandavas, you’ll regret it! It will be like the saddest story ever."

Vidura gave Dhritarashtra more advice. He said, "Don't trust people who are drunk, sleepy, or have bad friends. Be careful who you trust. Be kind, be honest, and be good to everyone!"  He explained that true strength is kindness, not anger.

Vidura ended with this advice: "Treat all your sons fairly—the Pandavas and Duryodhana. Don't let greed make you unhappy.  There's always a way to live, even without being a king of everything."
