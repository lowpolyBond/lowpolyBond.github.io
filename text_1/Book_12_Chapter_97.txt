Once upon a time, a wise prince named Yudhishthira asked his grandfather, Bhishma, a very brave and knowledgeable warrior, a question.  "Grandfather," he said, "kings fight many battles and kill lots of people.  How can they ever be good?"

Bhishma smiled.  "A good king protects the good people," he explained, "and punishes the bad.  Giving to others, doing good deeds, and praying help make a king pure. It's true, kings fight and many people die. But by doing good after the battles, they make up for it. It's like a farmer who pulls weeds from a field – some plants get taken away, but the rice grows better.  A king who protects his people from thieves and danger is like someone who gives them food, safety, and life. By doing right, a king goes to heaven when he dies."

Bhishma continued, "A king who fights bravely for good people and even dies in battle is like a great gift to the world. The gods love him! He earns many rewards in heaven. Even the pain and wounds he gets are like prayers, making him even better.  A brave soldier who protects his friends is better than someone who runs away in fear."

He said, "A true hero fights bravely, even if it means facing many enemies.  It's a glorious death. Someone who runs away from a battle is cowardly, and the gods are not happy with them. A warrior should never die quietly in bed. Dying in battle, surrounded by his friends, fighting for what is right, that is the best way for a brave warrior to go."

Bhishma explained that a brave warrior who fights to the very end, without fear, earns a place in heaven with the gods. He added that the blood and pain of a heroic death wash away all the king’s sins.  A warrior should always fight with courage and honor. That is the true path to happiness, both in this life and the next.
