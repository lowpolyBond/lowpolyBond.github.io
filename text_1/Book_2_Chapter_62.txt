King Dasharatha was very sad. Queen Kaushalya had said some hurtful things. He felt terrible. He thought about a mistake he made long ago. He accidentally killed a holy man with an arrow.

Now, he felt even worse because he had also sent his son, Rama, away.  His head hung low.  He said to Queen Kaushalya, "Please, don't be angry with me.  A wife should always respect her husband, even if he makes mistakes. I know you're wise, but your words hurt me."

Queen Kaushalya started to cry.  "Oh, my king," she said, taking his hands,  "Please don't be sad. I'm sorry for what I said. It wasn't right.  I should have been more patient.  I miss Rama so much! It feels like five years, not just five nights, since he left. My heart aches.  It's like a stormy river."

As she talked, the sun went down.  The king felt a little better.  He was still very tired and sad, but he finally fell asleep.
