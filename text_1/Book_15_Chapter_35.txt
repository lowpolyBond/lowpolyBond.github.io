Once upon a time, King Dhritarashtra was blind. He couldn't see his own sons!  A wise man, a Rishi, helped him see.  For the very first time, Dhritarashtra saw his sons. They looked just like him!  He was a very smart king, who knew all about being a king and had learned lots from wise books.  His brother Vidura was also very wise and good.  Dhritarashtra became successful because he met the wise man Vyasa.

King Janamejaya wanted to see his own father, Parikshit, who had died. He asked Vyasa, another very wise man, to show him.  Janamejaya said, "If I see my father, just as he was when he died, I will believe everything you've told me!"

Vyasa was kind.  He showed Janamejaya his father!  Parikshit looked handsome and exactly the same as when he passed away.  Janamejaya's friends and advisors saw him too. Janamejaya was so happy! He poured special water on his father, just like he did for himself.

Then, Janamejaya talked to Astika, a very good man. Astika said, “Because Vyasa was at your special ceremony, you’ve won! You have done a good thing, and you have seen the end of your father’s journey.  You have learned a very important lesson.  Your worries are gone.”

Janamejaya was grateful. He thanked Vyasa many, many times.  Then he asked about King Dhritarashtra.  He wanted to hear what happened to him after he lived in the forest.
