Arjuna, the brave warrior, promised to kill Jayadratha, the king of Sindhu.  But he made this promise without talking to Krishna, his wise friend and advisor.  Krishna was upset. "Arjuna," he said, "you made a big promise without asking me!  This is very risky!"

Krishna had sent spies to the enemy camp. They reported that Arjuna’s loud promise was heard by the Kauravas, the enemy army.  They were scared and ready for a big fight.  They thought Arjuna was coming to attack them!

Jayadratha, the king, was very scared. He was worried Arjuna would kill him because Arjuna wanted revenge for his son Abhimanyu's death.  Jayadratha went to Duryodhana, the Kaurava king, and pleaded for help.  "Arjuna is going to fight me tomorrow!" he cried. "He's so strong, even the gods can't stop him!  Please protect me!"

Duryodhana was worried too. He was very afraid of Arjuna. Jayadratha was so frightened that he even asked if he could go home!  Duryodhana thought hard.  Jayadratha said, "Arjuna is too powerful!  Even with Krishna fighting alongside him, he’s unbeatable!"

Duryodhana then talked to his teacher, Drona, and made a plan to protect Jayadratha.  They decided to put six strong warriors around Jayadratha to guard him. These were strong warriors, like Karna, Bhurisravas, and Drona's son.  They planned to protect him using a special formation, making it very hard for Arjuna to reach him.  

"Arjuna," Krishna said, "those six warriors are very strong. They will make it hard to reach Jayadratha.  We need to think carefully about how to win this battle."
