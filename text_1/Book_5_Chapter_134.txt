Once upon a time, in a land far away, lived a brave warrior named Sanjaya.  He was in big trouble. His mother, Vidula, saw him feeling sad and scared.  

"Sanjaya, my son," she said, "If you give up fighting, you'll become weak and unhappy.  A true warrior doesn't give up just because things are hard. People will think you're a coward!"

Vidula explained that the enemy, the King of the Sindhus, had many soldiers, but they were weak and scared too.  "If you fight bravely," she said, "other warriors will help you! Hide in the mountains until the enemy is weak. Then, strike!"

Vidula reminded Sanjaya that a wise man once said he would overcome his troubles and become great again. "Be brave, my son! Be strong! Live up to your name, Sanjaya – which means 'victorious'!"

She told him how their happy life had changed.  "Soon, we will be so poor we won't have enough food to eat. Our friends and servants will leave us.  How will I live, seeing you so weak?"

Vidula was very proud.  She and her husband had always helped others. Now, she didn’t want to have to ask for help.  "Son," she said, "You must fight! Be our strength! Be our boat to safety! Even if you have no friends, fight!  A brave man wins fame by fighting!"

She told him the story of Indra, a powerful god who became even stronger by defeating a monster. "Indra fought bravely and became a great king! You, too, can be strong! Fight your enemies and win back your honor!"

Vidula warned Sanjaya that being weak was worse than death. "Don’t be like a scared bull.  Don't let others boss you around. A true warrior, a Kshatriya, stands tall and brave. He only bows to wise Brahmans. He fights for what is right. He never gives up!"

"My son," she finished, "Remember who you are!  Be brave!  Be strong!  Fight!"
