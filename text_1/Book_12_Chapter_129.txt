King Yudhishthira loved listening to Bhishma's stories.  He said, "Grandpa, your stories are like sweet nectar! I can never get enough!"

Bhishma smiled. "Then listen to this story about a wise man named Gotama and the King of Death, Yama! Gotama lived in a cave on a mountain for sixty thousand years! He was very, very good and did many hard things to become even better.

One day, Yama visited Gotama.  Gotama was very respectful and bowed down. Yama asked, "What can I do for you, wise man?"

Gotama said, "How can I repay my parents for all they've done?  And how can I go to a wonderful place after I die?"

Yama answered, "Always tell the truth, be good, and do hard things to become better.  Worship your parents.  And give lots of gifts to wise people. By doing all these things, youâ€™ll go to a happy place after you die!"
