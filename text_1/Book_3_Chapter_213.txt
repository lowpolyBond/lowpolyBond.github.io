Once upon a time, a wise man named Markandeya told King Yudhishthira a story.  The story was about a bird-catcher, a man who caught birds for a living.  This bird-catcher was very kind and loved his parents very much.

A holy man, a Brahman, met the bird-catcher.  The Brahman learned about the bird-catcher's life and was very impressed.  "I want to meet your parents," said the Brahman.

The bird-catcher happily took the Brahman to his home.  It was a beautiful house! It was so nice, it looked like a palace.  His parents were sitting there, all happy and relaxed.

The bird-catcher bowed down to his parents. They were so proud of him.  They said, "You are such a good son! You take such good care of us." They praised his kindness and his hard work.

The bird-catcher explained to the Brahman, "My parents are my gods.  I serve them like people serve the gods in temples. I give them the best food, the nicest clothes, and I always do what makes them happy. I help them with everything.  They are more important to me than anything else.‚Äù

He told the Brahman that taking care of his parents was more important than anything else, even more important than worshiping other gods. He said looking after his parents was like doing a special kind of prayer.  

The Brahman was amazed. He learned that being a good son and taking care of your parents is a very important and holy thing to do. The bird-catcher showed the Brahman that being a good son is the greatest worship of all.
