Prince Bharata needed a road!  So he gathered lots of helpers.  There were builders, woodcutters, well-diggers, and even cooks!  They were like a huge, moving ocean.

These super-strong workers chopped down trees, cleared bushes, and blasted rocks.  They made the path smooth and flat.  They built bridges over little rivers. They even dug wells for fresh water!  They made the road beautiful, sprinkling it with sweet-smelling sandalwood and pretty flowers. It looked like a road for gods!

The builders made comfy houses near the road, close to water and fruit trees.  They made camps for the army, just like Prince Bharata wanted.  They built a special, amazing place for Prince Bharata to live.  It was huge and strong, with walls and moats all around.  It even had shiny white temples!

They built lots of houses too, with pretty flags. The houses were so tall and beautiful, they looked like homes for the gods. The whole place was even more amazing than a god's city!

The road went all the way to the river Ganges.  The river was cool and full of fishes, flowing through the forests.  The road was so pretty, with the moon and stars shining at night, it was like a magical path!
