Long ago, a king wanted to give the whole Earth away!  The Earth was scared!  She said, "I'm Brahman's daughter!  I hold all the living things. Why does the king want to give me away?"  The Earth was so worried, she decided to go back to her father, Brahman.

But a wise man named Kasyapa saw her leaving.  He used his magic to become part of the Earth!  While he was inside the Earth, everything grew strong and healthy.  There was no fear!  Kasyapa stayed inside the Earth for a very, very long time. Then, the Earth went back to her father and became Kasyapa's daughter.  The god of the wind told this story to show how powerful wise men are.

Then, the god of the wind told another story.  A beautiful woman named Bhadra was going to marry a wise man named Utathya. But Varuna, the god of the ocean, wanted Bhadra for himself!  He stole her away to his beautiful palace, which had tons of lakes and sparkling treasures.

Utathya asked his friend Narada to talk to Varuna.  Narada went to Varuna, but Varuna wouldn't give Bhadra back! He said she was too precious.  Narada went back to Utathya, who was very angry.

Utathya was so powerful! He used his magic to dry up the ocean!  Varuna was very sad. He finally gave Bhadra back. Utathya brought the water back.  He saved everyone!  The god of the wind told this story to show how powerful wise men are.

The god of the wind asked Arjuna, "Can you name a king who is as great as Kasyapa or Utathya?" Arjuna didn't answer.  The stories showed that wise men were very powerful.
