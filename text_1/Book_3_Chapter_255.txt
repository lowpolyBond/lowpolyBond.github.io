Duryodhana, the Kaurava prince, was coming home after a big ceremony.  People threw flowers and sweet rice on him, saying, "Your ceremony went so well!"  But some people said, "It wasn't as good as Yudhishthira's!"

Duryodhana's friends told him, "Your ceremony was the best ever!  Great kings like Yayati and Nahusha went to heaven after doing such ceremonies!"  Duryodhana felt happy and went home. He bowed to his parents, Bhishma, Drona, Kripa, and Vidura.  His brothers bowed to him.

Then Karna, the son of a charioteer, spoke up. "Your ceremony was great! But it will be even better when you kill the Pandavas and have another big ceremony called the Rajasuya!"

Duryodhana said, "You're right!  I'll have the Rajasuya once the Pandavas are defeated!"  Karna made a big promise.  "I won't eat meat or let anyone wash my feet until I kill Arjuna!"  The Kauravas cheered! They thought victory was theirs.  Duryodhana went to his room, feeling very pleased.

Meanwhile, the Pandavas, far away in the forest, heard about Karna's promise.  They were worried.  They knew Karna was a strong warrior.  They were scared and decided to leave the forest.

Duryodhana, with his brothers, Bhishma, Drona, and Kripa, ruled the kingdom.  Karna helped him, and Duryodhana was kind to everyone. He gave lots of gifts and had many ceremonies. He thought the best thing to do with riches was to give them away and enjoy life.
