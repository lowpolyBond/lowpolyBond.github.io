Once upon a time, after a big battle, some brave warriors from the Kaurava army were very sad. They were hurt and tired.  They hid in a forest near the Pandava camp. They heard the Pandavas celebrating their victory and were scared they would be chased. So they ran away.  They were very angry about their loss.

King Dhritarashtra, the father of the Kauravas, was heartbroken.  His son, Duryodhana, who was as strong as ten thousand elephants, had been killed by Bhima! He cried, "My hundred sons are gone! How can I live like this?" He was very upset that he could no longer rule his kingdom.

Sanjaya, who was telling the king what happened, described how Kritavarma, Kripa, and Ashvatthama (Drona's son) found a big, shady banyan tree in the forest.  They rested there, tired and sad.  The forest was full of animals and sounds, and night fell.

Ashvatthama, who couldn't sleep because he was so angry, saw an owl killing sleeping crows. This gave him a bad idea. He thought, "If an owl can kill sleeping crows, I can kill the sleeping Pandavas!"  He remembered what people said:  "It's okay to fight your enemies even when they are sleeping!"

Ashvatthama woke up Kripa and the Bhoja chief.  He told them his evil plan to sneak into the Pandava camp and kill everyone while they were asleep.  Kripa and the Bhoja chief felt ashamed but didn't stop him.

Ashvatthama was very angry. He remembered all the Kauravas who had died. He wanted revenge. He thought the Pandavas had been too mean and unfair. He decided he would kill them while they were asleep.  He felt that winning was more important than being fair.
