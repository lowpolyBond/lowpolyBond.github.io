King Dhritarashtra was blind. He couldn't see the great battle.  He said to his friend Sanjaya, "Sanjaya, I wish I could see! I wish I could see Krishna!

Krishna is so handsome! He shines brightly, like the sun.  Everyone listens carefully when he speaks. His words bring good luck to his friends, the Pandavas.  His words are dangerous to his enemies.

Krishna is brave and strong, a great warrior. He leads the Yadava army.  He scares all his enemies. He defeats anyone who stands against him.  He is the best warrior!

The Kauravas, my sons, will see Krishna.  He'll speak kindly, and even my sons will be charmed by him.

Sanjaya, Krishna is amazing! He's like a wise teacher, a powerful bird, a great hero who protects everyone. He's ancient and powerful, like the creator of the whole world! He's the leader of the gods, and he's even older than the gods themselves! Heâ€™s the best of the best!"
