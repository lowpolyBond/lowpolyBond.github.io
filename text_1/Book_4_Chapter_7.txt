Once upon a time, Yudhishthira, a very brave and handsome king, needed to hide.  He looked a little sad, like the sun behind clouds.  He went to King Virata's palace.  He looked so regal, even though he didn't have any servants or fancy carriages.

King Virata saw him and wondered who he was.  "He looks like a king," he said to his advisors. "But he doesn't seem like a priest.  Let's find out who he is!"

Yudhishthira went to King Virata and said, "Your Majesty, I'm a poor priest who has lost everything. I'd be grateful if I could work for you."

King Virata was kind. "Welcome!  You can work for me!"  He really liked Yudhishthira.  "Tell me your name and where you're from," he asked.

Yudhishthira said, "My name is Kanka. I'm a priest, and I'm good at playing dice. I used to be friends with a king named Yudhishthira."

King Virata said, "You can have anything you want!  You can even rule part of my kingdom! I love clever gamblers, and you are amazing!"

Yudhishthira asked for a special favor. "Please, don't let anyone argue with me about dice games. And if I win, the loser should give me their money."

King Virata agreed.  "I will help you!  You're like a king to me!  You'll have everything you need: clothes, food, and your own special carriage. You'll help me run the kingdom.  And you can always come to me if anyone needs help."

So Yudhishthira, as Kanka, lived happily in King Virata's kingdom.  Nobody knew his real identity.  He was safe and well-liked by everyone.
