Once upon a time, Uma, a beautiful goddess, asked the great god Shiva, "Oh, powerful one, how can people be good and go to heaven? What makes people do bad things?"

Shiva smiled. "Uma, you already know much about being good.  But I'll tell you anyway. People get into trouble because of what they think, say, and do.  But those same things can also set them free!"

"To go to heaven," Shiva explained, "people must be truthful. They must earn their money fairly and be kind.  People who are wise and don't doubt themselves never get stuck in trouble, good or bad.  If you don't hurt anyone with your thoughts, words, or actions, you'll be happy.  Be kind to everyone, even if they're not kind to you. Never take what isn't yours. Always respect other people's families."

Uma asked, "But what about words? How do words get us into trouble or help us?"

Shiva said, "Never lie, even if it's a joke. Speak kindly to everyone.  Don't say mean or hurtful things. Always speak the truth and try to make people feel good."

Uma then asked, "And what about our thoughts? How do those affect us?"

Shiva answered, "Good thoughts lead to heaven. Don't even *think* about taking things that don't belong to you. Don't even *think* about other people's partners. Be kind in your thoughts, and be fair to everyone.  Be truthful and happy with what you have. If you are kind, compassionate, and wise, you will be happy."


Finally, Uma asked, "Why do some people live long lives and others don't? Why are some people beautiful and others not? Why are some people smart and others not?"

Shiva said, "It all depends on what they do.  If someone is mean and hurts others, they will have a bad life and might even go to a bad place. But if someone is kind and compassionate to everyone, including little insects, they will have a good life and might even become like a god! People who are kind and don't hurt anyone live long, happy lives.  The great god Brahma taught this a long, long time ago: donâ€™t hurt anyone."
