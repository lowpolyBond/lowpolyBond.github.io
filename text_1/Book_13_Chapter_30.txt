King Yudhisthira asked Bhishma, "I heard that it's very hard to become a Brahmin priest.  But I also heard that King Vitahavya became one!  How did he do it? Was it magic, or was it because he was very good?"

Bhishma said, "Let me tell you the story!  Long ago, King Vitahavya had a hundred sons. They were strong warriors, very good at fighting! They fought a lot with King Haryyaswa and his family."

"King Haryyaswa's grandson, King Divodasa, was very brave. He rebuilt his city and made it strong. But the hundred sons of Vitahavya attacked him again and again! They fought for a thousand days!  Finally, Divodasa lost his army and his kingdom. He ran away for help."

Divodasa went to a wise priest named Bharadwaja.  He begged for help, "Those sons of Vitahavya killed everyone in my family!  I'm the only one left!"

Bharadwaja said, "Don't worry! I'll help you!"  He did a special magic ritual. Divodasa got a super strong son, Pratarddana! Pratarddana was very smart and brave. He was like a grown man when he was born!

Pratarddana fought the sons of Vitahavya. He won! He defeated them all and they ran away. King Vitahavya hid with a different priest, Bhrigu.

Pratarddana found Vitahavya.  He wanted to kill him. But Bhrigu said, "There are only Brahmins here, no warriors."

Pratarddana was happy.  Because Vitahavya was surrounded by Brahmins, he became one too!  Just like that!  He became a Brahmin priest.  

Bhishma continued, "Vitahavya had a son, then a grandson, and so on.  Many great Brahmins came from his family.  And that's how a king became a priest!"
