Shalya, Karna's chariot driver, started teasing Karna.  Shalya said mean things about Karna's skills.  Karna got really angry!

"Shalya," Karna roared, "you don't know anything about being brave! You're not brave at all! You can't judge my skills.  I know Arjuna is strong. I know his bow and arrows are powerful.  I even know how amazing Krishna is!  But I'm not scared. I'm going to fight them!"

Karna showed Shalya a special arrow. "This arrow," he said, "is super sharp and deadly!  It’s been blessed and I've kept it safe for years.  It can pierce anything—even a mountain! I'll only use it on Arjuna or Krishna.  Today, I'll fight them both! Krishna and Arjuna are the best warriors, like two powerful tigers.  But I’m not afraid.  You’ll see how strong I am!"

Karna then started insulting Shalya.  He called Shalya a bad person, not a good friend, and said that people from Shalya's country, Madra, were known for being mean and dishonest.  He said lots of bad things about Madra people and their ways, telling stories about how they behaved.

Karna continued, "You are scared, Shalya!  The Pandavas have tricked you!  They are friends of yours, are they not? I will fight them whether you want me to or not!  I'm not scared of a thousand Arjuns and Krishnas!  I'll fight them all!  Keep quiet!"

Karna told Shalya that either he (Karna) would win the battle, or Arjuna and Krishna would win. Then he said, "Today, you will see if Karna or Krishna and Arjuna win this battle. Now, let's fight!"  Then, Karna shouted to Shalya, "Let's go! Let's go!"
