Once upon a time, before a big, scary battle, Yudhishthira heard that his grandfather, Bhishma, a super strong warrior, was going to lead the enemy army.  Bhishma was so strong, he was like the ocean, the mountains, and even the sun!

Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, and Krishna talked about what to do. Yudhishthira was a clever king. He told his brothers, "Let's get ready for war! We need seven leaders for our army!"

Krishna, a wise friend, agreed.  He said, "Let's pick the best leaders."

So Yudhishthira chose seven amazing warriors: Drupada, Virata, the brave warrior from Sini's family, Dhrishtadyumna, Dhrishtaketu, Shikhandi, and Sahadeva.  Dhrishtadyumna was the main leader, and Arjuna, a great archer, was in charge of all the leaders.  Krishna himself became Arjuna's charioteer and guide.

Just then, more strong warriors arrived!  Halayudha, a powerful prince, came with many friends.  He looked like a mighty lion.  Everyone greeted him with respect.  Yudhishthira even shook his hand.

Halayudha sat down and said, "This battle is going to be terrible.  It's like fate. I hope everyone survives.  It's going to be a really big fight! I've always been friends with both the Pandavas and the Kauravas.  But I can't watch my friends die. So I'm going to go away for a while."

Halayudha said goodbye to Krishna and the Pandavas, and went to a holy river to pray. He knew he couldn't watch such a terrible battle.
