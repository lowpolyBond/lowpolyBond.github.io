Once upon a time, Queen Sachi, Indra's beautiful wife, met a magical fairy named Divination.  Divination said, "I can show you Indra, the mighty god!"

Sachi followed Divination. They flew over sparkling rivers and tall, tall mountains.  Finally, they reached a huge, beautiful island with a giant lake!

This lake was so big, it took eight hundred miles to walk around it!  Pretty, colorful lotuses floated everywhere, buzzing with bees.  In the middle of the lake, on a giant white lotus, was a tiny, tiny Indra!

Sachi shrunk down to be tiny too, so she could talk to him.  She told Indra about a very bad king named Nahusha.  Nahusha was very mean and wanted Sachi to be his queen!

Sachi was scared.  She begged Indra, "Please, my powerful husband, help me!  Nahusha is very strong.  Only you can stop him!"

Indra, still tiny, listened to his worried wife. He knew he had to get big and strong again to protect Sachi and his kingdom!
