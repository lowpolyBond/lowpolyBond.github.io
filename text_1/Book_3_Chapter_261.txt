Once upon a time, a very important holy man named Durvasa and his 10,000 friends came to visit the Pandava brothers in the forest.  Yudhishthira, the eldest Pandava brother, welcomed them politely.  He asked them to wash up and come back for a big feast.

But Draupadi, the Pandavas' wife, was worried!  She didn't have enough food for so many people. She prayed to Krishna, a powerful god, for help.  She told Krishna about her problem, asking for his help, just like he had helped her before.

Krishna, hearing Draupadi's prayer, quickly came to her. He pretended to be very hungry and asked Draupadi for food.  Draupadi showed him a special bowl that always had food.  But it was empty!  Clever Krishna found just a tiny bit of rice and vegetable stuck to the side of the bowl.  He ate it, saying, "This is enough to satisfy the gods!"

Then Krishna told Bhima, the strongest Pandava, to invite Durvasa and his friends to dinner. Bhima went to the river where they were washing.  But something strange happened!  All the holy men suddenly felt full! They were amazed. They told Durvasa they couldn't eat.

Durvasa was scared. He knew the Pandavas were powerful and holy. He was afraid they would be angry if the holy men didn't eat the food. So Durvasa and all his friends ran away without saying goodbye!

Bhima couldn't find them.  He told Yudhishthira what happened.  Yudhishthira was worried they would be blamed for the ruined feast.  Then, Krishna appeared again. He told them not to worry â€“ Durvasa and his friends were so scared of the Pandavas' power that they ran away!

The Pandavas were very relieved.  They thanked Krishna for saving them from trouble.  Then Krishna went home, and the Pandavas continued to live happily in the forest with Draupadi.  The trick that Krishna used stopped the bad people, the Kauravas, from causing trouble for the Pandavas.
