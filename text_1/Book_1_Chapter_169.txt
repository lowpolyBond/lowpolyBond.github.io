King Drupada was very sad. He didn't have any children.  He wanted a son strong enough to defeat his enemy, Drona.  He searched everywhere for wise Brahmins (holy men) who could help him.

He finally found two Brahmin brothers, Yaja and Upayaja.  King Drupada begged Upayaja to perform a special magic ritual to give him a strong son. Upayaja said he couldn't, but he told the king to ask his brother, Yaja, who liked nice things.

King Drupada went to Yaja and promised him many cows if he did the ritual. Yaja agreed! He asked his brother Upayaja for help.

Yaja performed the ritual.  Suddenly, flames shot up! Out popped a boy, strong and ready for battle! He even had a chariot and armor!  Everyone cheered!  A magical voice said the boy, named Dhrishtadyumna, would defeat Drona!

Then, from the same fire, a beautiful girl appeared. Her name was Krishna (which means dark). A voice said she would be very important and powerful.

The queen, Drupadaâ€™s wife, wanted to be the children's mother. Yaja said, "Of course!"  The Brahmins were so happy for the king!

Drona, the king's enemy, later taught Dhrishtadyumna how to fight.  Even though Drona was powerful, he knew that everything happens for a reason.  He knew Dhrishtadyumna was meant to be a great warrior.  And so, the story continues...
