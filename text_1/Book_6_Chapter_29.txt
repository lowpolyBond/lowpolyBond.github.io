Arjuna was confused.  He asked Krishna, "Should we do things, or should we not do things? Which is better?"

Krishna smiled. "Both are good paths to peace," he said. "But doing things while staying calm is better.  A truly peaceful person doesn't get upset or excited. They are happy either way. Some people think being quiet and doing nothing (Sankhya) is different from doing things while staying calm (Yoga). But they are really the same!  If you do one, you get the benefits of both."

Krishna continued, "Giving up everything without being calm is hard. But if you are calm while you work, you will reach peace quickly. If you're calm inside, even while doing things like eating, sleeping, or talking, you won't be trapped by what you do.  It's like a lotus leaf – water rolls right off!  You just do things, and leave the results to God."

Krishna explained, "A peaceful person does things without wanting anything in return. They see themselves as part of everything.  They're not attached to the results of their actions. If you are attached to the results, then you will feel upset when the results don’t come the way you want.  Only those who don’t want anything in return will be happy."


Krishna said, "It's not God who makes you do things.  It's nature. God doesn't punish you for mistakes or reward you for good deeds.  It's our ignorance that makes us unhappy. Knowing yourself and God gets rid of this ignorance. People who truly know God, live in God, and aim for God, never have to return to this world of pain."

Krishna said that a wise person treats everyone the same – a learned priest, a cow, an elephant, even a dog or someone from a low caste. They see everyone as equal.  Because they see everything as equal, they are at peace. They are like God, fair and kind to all.

A peaceful person doesn't get too excited when good things happen, and they don't get too sad when bad things happen. They find happiness within themselves.  They don't chase after things from the outside. True happiness comes from inside. Happiness that comes from things outside of you always ends.

Krishna said, "The person who is calm and peaceful, who is happy inside, who knows their true self – that person becomes one with God."  This is true both in life and after life.

To reach this peace, Krishna said, close your eyes, focus between your eyebrows, and breathe deeply.  Control your thoughts and your senses.  Let go of fear, anger, and wanting.  Know that I am the source of all and friend to all.  Then you will have peace.
