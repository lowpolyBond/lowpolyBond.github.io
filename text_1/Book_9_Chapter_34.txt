Once upon a time, a great battle was about to begin.  The Pandavas, five brave brothers, were ready to fight.  A special guest arrived: Rama, a powerful man who used a plow as his weapon.  He had come to watch his two students fight!

One student was Bhima, a Pandava brother, strong like a giant.  The other student was Duryodhana, a mean prince who wanted to fight Bhima. Rama was happy to see everyone.  The Pandavas greeted Rama and showed him respect.  They said, "Rama, watch our friends fight!"

Rama had been away for 42 days. He said, "I'm here to watch Bhima and Duryodhana fight with their big sticks!"  Bhima and Duryodhana looked strong and ready.  King Yudhishthira, the oldest Pandava, welcomed Rama.  Everyone – even Krishna, a good friend of the Pandavas, and other important people – greeted Rama. They were all very happy to see him.

Everyone asked Rama how he was.  Rama asked them all how they were, too.  He gave special hugs to Krishna and another brave warrior, Satyaki. They were all so excited for the big fight!  Yudhishthira then said, "Rama, watch these two brothers fight!"

Rama, dressed in blue, sat among the kings. He looked as bright and beautiful as the moon surrounded by stars. Then, the amazing, scary, and exciting fight began!  It was the final battle between the two brothers, and it was about to decide everything!
