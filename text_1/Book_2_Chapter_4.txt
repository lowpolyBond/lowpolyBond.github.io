King Dasaratha was getting old. He decided it was time to choose a new king.  He chose his son, Rama, who was kind and brave.

The king told his advisors, "Tomorrow, Rama will become the next king!"

He sent a messenger, Sumantra, to tell Rama. Rama was surprised! He hurried to his father's palace.

King Dasaratha hugged Rama. "My son," he said, "I'm old and have done many good things.  But I've had some scary dreams.  Tomorrow, under a lucky star, you will be crowned king!"

The king explained that the astrologers said tomorrow was a good day for Rama's coronation. He told Rama to fast and pray with his wife, Sita, that night.

Rama went home, but Sita wasn't there! He found her with his mother, Queen Kaushalya, and his brother, Lakshmana.  They were all so happy!

Rama told his mother, "Father wants me to be king tomorrow!"  His mother cried happy tears.  She was so proud.

Rama also told Lakshmana, "You'll rule with me, brother! We'll share the kingdom."

Then Rama and Sita went home to get ready for the big day.  They were excited and a little nervous about being king and queen!
