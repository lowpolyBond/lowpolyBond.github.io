Once upon a time, after a big battle, King Yudhishthira found his brothers – Arjuna, Bhima, and the twins Nakula and Sahadeva – lying still.  They looked like giants who had fallen from the sky.  Yudhishthira was very, very sad.  Tears streamed down his face.

He cried out, "Bhima, you promised to smash Duryodhana's legs!  Arjuna, the gods said you'd be a great hero! Why are you all gone?  How could such brave warriors be defeated?"

Yudhishthira looked around.  There were no weapons or footprints. He wondered, "Who could have done this?  Was it Duryodhana?  Or maybe some magic?" He noticed his brothers' skin was still bright and not pale like dead people.  He thought, "Only Yama, the god of death, could defeat them."

Then he found a lake. As he went to get water, a magical being spoke from the sky!  It was a Yaksha, a magical creature.  The Yaksha said, "I'm a Yaksha, not a bird! I made your brothers sleep because they disobeyed me. If you answer my questions, you can have water. If not, you'll be the fifth one to sleep forever!"

Yudhishthira was scared, but he agreed. The Yaksha asked many tricky questions:

* What makes the sun rise? (Brahma)
* What is the best way to be smart? (Studying)
* What is the best thing for farmers? (Rain)
* Who is heavier than the earth? (A mother)
* What never closes its eyes? (A fish)


Yudhishthira answered all the questions wisely and truthfully. He even explained what makes a good king, a good soldier, and a good person.  He showed that he was kind and fair.

Finally, the Yaksha was impressed.  "You answered all my questions honestly," he said.  "You can choose one brother to wake up."

Yudhishthira could have chosen Bhima, his strongest brother, or Arjuna, his best warrior. But he chose Nakula, his stepbrother.  He explained, "My father had two wives, and I love them both equally.  I won't favor one over the other."

The Yaksha was amazed by Yudhishthira's fairness and kindness. He said, "Because you are so fair and kind, all your brothers will wake up!" And they did!  Yudhishthira learned that kindness and truth are more powerful than anything.
