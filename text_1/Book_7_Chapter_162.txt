Once upon a time, during a big, scary battle in the Mahabharata, a terrible dust storm came.  It was so dark, the soldiers couldn't see each other!  Brave warriors like Drona, Karna, Kripa, Bhima, and others fought, guessing where their enemies were.  It was a terrible mess â€“ lots of chariots, elephants, horses, and soldiers crashing into each other.  The soldiers got scared and ran away, and many died.  All this happened because of bad advice from someone's son.

King Dhritarashtra was worried.  He asked Sanjaya, "Sanjaya, what happened when it got so dark?  How could we see the enemy again?"

Sanjaya said, "The Kaurava army's leaders got them all back together. Drona was in front, Salya in the back, and Drona's son and Sakuni were on the sides.  King Duryodhana helped everyone. He told his soldiers, 'Put down your big weapons and pick up bright lamps!'

The soldiers were happy to do this.  Even the gods and magical creatures in the sky lit up their own lamps!  They wanted to help Duryodhana.  Lots and lots of lamps shone.  Each chariot had five lamps, each elephant had three, and each horse had one! The Kaurava army looked amazing in the light from all those lamps and their shiny armor.

The Pandavas, seeing this, did the same thing.  They lit up their army with lots of lamps too!  There were so many lamps, it looked like lightning in the night sky.  The soldiers, elephants, and chariots were all mixed up together, but now everyone could see!  It was so bright, the gods and magical creatures came to watch the battle!  It was like a magical battle in the sky!  Arrows flew like a storm, and the brave warriors fought hard.  The brave Aswatthaman, a very powerful warrior, fought like the sun, shining brightly and making the Pandavas run.  It was a very exciting battle!
