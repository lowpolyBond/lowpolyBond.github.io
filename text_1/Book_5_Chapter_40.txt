Vidura, a wise man, told King Dhritarashtra a story.  He said, "Being kind and humble helps you succeed.  If something is wrong, even if it's important, don't do it.  It's like a snake shedding its old skin – you'll feel much better without the bad thing."

He said three things are as bad as killing a good person: cheating, lying to the king, and lying to your teacher.  Being too jealous, bragging, or being mean can ruin you.  For students, being lazy, distracted, or proud is bad.  You can't have fun *and* be a good student all the time.  It’s like fire – it never gets full, and it burns everything. The ocean never gets full either.  Death never gets enough, and beautiful women never get enough attention. Hope can make you impatient, anger can ruin your good fortune, and being greedy can ruin your reputation.  Even one angry teacher can hurt a whole kingdom!

Vidura told the king to always have good things in his house: goats, brass, silver, honey, medicine, birds, poor but important people, and wise old people.  He also said, "Never give up being good, no matter what.  Being good is forever, but happiness and sadness are only for a little while. Choose what lasts forever."  Even rich and powerful kings die, and their bodies are burned like wood. Only their good and bad deeds go with them.

Vidura said life is like a river. Being good is like taking a bath in that river.  Good deeds are like clean water, and self-control is like the riverbanks.  Our senses are like the river's water, and anger and wanting things are like crocodiles!  Self-control is your raft to get across.  Listen to wise friends for advice.  Control your wants, your hands, feet, eyes, ears and thoughts.  Good people always do well.

He explained how everyone should live a good life, no matter what their job is. Then he said, "Yudhishthira, your nephew, isn't being a good king.  Help him!"

King Dhritarashtra said, "You're right. I want to help the Pandavas, but my son Duryodhana makes it hard.  Sometimes, no matter what we do, bad things happen.  Our destiny is already written."
