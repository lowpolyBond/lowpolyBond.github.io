King Dhritarashtra was very sad. He heard that his son, Duryodhana, was probably dead.  He was so upset he fell to the ground like a dizzy elephant!  The queen and the other ladies cried loudly. Their cries were so loud, it seemed the whole earth was filled with sadness.  They were heartbroken and cried a lot.

Sanjaya, the king's charioteer, tried to comfort them. Even though he helped, the women still trembled like leaves in a strong wind. Vidura, a wise man, also helped the king.  He poured water on Dhritarashtra and helped him feel better.  The king was quiet for a long time, like he couldn't think straight.

Then, he thought hard. He was angry at his sons for their bad actions. He was happy that the Pandavas, his nephews, had won. He was also angry at himself and at Shakuni, his brother-in-law, for their bad advice. He trembled again with sadness and anger.

Finally, he calmed down and asked Sanjaya, "Sanjaya, is my son Duryodhana really dead?  Even if you have to tell me again, please tell me the truth!"

Sanjaya said, "King, Duryodhana is dead.  He and his brothers, sons, and friends, all the great warriors, are dead.  Even Duhshasana is dead.  Bhima, a Pandava, even drank his blood in anger during the battle!"
