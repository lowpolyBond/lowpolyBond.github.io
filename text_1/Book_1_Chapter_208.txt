Once upon a time, in a land far away, King Dhritarashtra was sad.  His nephews, the Pandavas, were gone.  Wise people like Bhishma, Drona, and Vidura told him the Pandavas were also his children, and they deserved to rule, too.  Dhritarashtra was happy to hear this! He said, "The Pandavas are my children!  They should come home!"

He asked Vidura, his wise brother, to bring the Pandavas back.  Dhritarashtra said, "Vidura, take lots of gifts!  Bring the Pandavas, their mother Kunti, and their amazing wife, Draupadi, back to our kingdom!"  He was so happy that the Pandavas were still alive and had married Draupadi.

Vidura went to where the Pandavas were staying with King Drupada, Draupadi's father. He brought many jewels and treasures.  He greeted everyone kindly.  He hugged the Pandavas and asked how they were. They were so happy to see him!

Vidura spoke to King Drupada, explaining that Dhritarashtra and everyone in their kingdom wanted the Pandavas to return.  He said, "King Dhritarashtra is overjoyed by your daughter's marriage to the Pandavas.  Bhishma and Drona are also very happy!  Everyone misses the Pandavas.  Please, let them come home."

Vidura explained that the people were eagerly waiting for the Pandavas, Kunti, and Draupadi. Everyone wanted to see them! King Drupada agreed.  Vidura sent swift messengers to tell King Dhritarashtra the good news.  Soon, the Pandavas were on their way home!
