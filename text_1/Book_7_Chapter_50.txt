Once upon a time, during a terrible battle, Yudhishthira was very sad. His nephew, Abhimanyu, a brave young warrior, had been killed.  Abhimanyu was still a child, but he fought so bravely against many, many enemies.  Yudhishthira cried, "He was too young to fight such a tough battle!  He went into the enemy army, but we couldn't follow him."

Then, a wise old man named Vyasa came to comfort Yudhishthira. Vyasa said, "Yudhishthira, even though Abhimanyu was young, he fought like a grown-up.  He's gone to heaven now. Death comes to everyone, even gods and powerful beings."

But Yudhishthira was still heartbroken. He said, "So many brave warriors died! They were strong as ten thousand elephants!  Who could defeat them?  I don't understand death. Where does it come from? Why does it take people away?"

Vyasa decided to tell Yudhishthira a story.  He told him about King Akampana, whose son, Hari, was a very strong and handsome warrior.  Hari fought bravely in battle but was also killed.  King Akampana was very sad, just like Yudhishthira.

Another wise man, Narada, came to Akampana and explained about death. Narada said, a long, long time ago, when the world was very new, the great god Brahma, who created everything, got angry.  He made a huge fire to destroy the whole world!

A different god, Shiva, saw this and asked Brahma to stop. Brahma agreed, but said he needed a way to keep the balance, to make sure the world didn't get too full.  So, he created Death. Death makes sure that everyone eventually leaves the world, so there's always room for new life.  That way, the world is always balanced.

Vyasa finished the story. He told Yudhishthira that death is a natural part of life.  It’s sad, but it’s how things are.  Understanding this helped Yudhishthira feel a little bit better.
