Once upon a time, the Pandava brothers lived in the forest.  A young prince named Janamejaya wanted to know what happened next.  He asked a wise storyteller, Vaisampayana, "What did Duryodhana and his friends do while the Pandavas were away?"

Vaisampayana began, "After Duryodhana was saved by the Pandavas, he returned home.  Bhishma, a wise old man, scolded him.  Bhishma said, 'Duryodhana, you were captured!  You weren't even brave enough to fight!  Even Karna, who is supposed to be a great warrior, ran away! The Pandavas are much braver and better than you and Karna.  We should make peace with them!'"

Duryodhana just laughed.  He and his friend Sakuni left. Karna, Dussasana, and many other warriors followed them.  Bhishma was ashamed of Duryodhana and went to his own room.

Duryodhana then talked to his friends.  Karna said, "Duryodhana, Bhishma always praises the Pandavas and makes fun of us!  I'll show him! I'll win many battles and conquer the whole land! Then Bhishma will be sorry!"

Duryodhana was very happy. "Karna, you are my best friend!" he said.  Karna prepared his army. On a lucky day, with many blessings and prayers, Karna's army set off, their chariots rattling loudly.  The whole world could hear them!
