Once upon a time, a very powerful, holy man lived. He was the son of two gods, Mitra and Varuna.  This amazing man decided to drink the whole ocean!

He told the other gods, "I'm going to drink the ocean! Get ready!"

And he started to drink!  All the worlds watched in amazement.  The gods were super surprised. They shouted, "You're amazing! You protect us all! You even made the world! Thank you!"

While magical music played and flowers rained down, the holy man drank the entire ocean dry!

The gods were so happy! They grabbed their magical weapons and fought the bad demons who lived in the ocean.  These demons were strong and yelled, but the gods were even stronger and faster. The demons fought hard, but the gods, helped by the holy man's actions, won the battle.  Even when they died, the demons looked beautiful, like trees covered in flowers.

A few demons escaped. They hid deep underground.  The gods thanked the holy man. "You saved us! You killed the bad demons! Please fill the ocean back up!" they begged.

But the holy man smiled and said, "I already digested the water. You'll have to find another way to fill the ocean."

The gods were sad and surprised. They said goodbye to the holy man and went to see another god, Brahma, to figure out how to get their ocean back.
