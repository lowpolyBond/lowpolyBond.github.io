Once upon a time, after Bhishma finished speaking, Drona, a wise teacher, spoke to King Dhritarashtra.  He said, "King, good friends always give honest and helpful advice.  I agree with Bhishma. Let's share the kingdom with the Pandavas! That's the right thing to do.  Send a nice messenger to King Drupada right away.  Give him lots of gifts for the Pandavas, their brides, and the bridegrooms. Tell Drupada how happy you and Duryodhana are about this wedding. Tell him how much this new friendship means to you.  Give Draupadi beautiful gold jewelry and give gifts to Drupada's sons. Ask Drupada to let the Pandavas come back home.  Then, send Duhsasana and Vikarna to welcome them with a big parade! When they arrive, treat them like family and give them back their rightful place as kings!"

Then, Karna spoke.  He said, "Bhishma and Drona are your rich and favored friends.  Their advice isn't good for you!  Wise people know that sometimes friends can't help, and sometimes good or bad things happen because of luck.  There was once a king named Amvuvicha. His minister, Mahakarni, took all the king's power and wealth. Even though the king didn't care, Mahakarni couldn't become king. This shows that whether you become powerful or not depends on your luck!  So, King, if it's your destiny to be king, you will be, no matter what anyone says. If not, nothing will change that."

Drona heard Karna and said, "Karna, you're being mean because you want to hurt the Pandavas. My advice is for the good of everyone. If you think it's wrong, tell us what you think is better!  If we don't follow good advice, the Kurus will be destroyed!"
