Once upon a time, after a big battle, the Pandava brothers were feeling very sad.  Yudhishthira, their leader, said, "Everyone thinks we're lucky, but we're actually very unhappy. We have everything, but we're still so sad!  Being alive seems to only bring sorrow. When will we be free from all this sadness?"

Bhishma, a wise old man, answered, "Everything ends, even life itself.  Don't worry so much about your troubles. You are good people, and you will find peace eventually.  Think of it like this:  A person is like the wind. The wind itself has no color, but it can carry dust.  That dust makes the wind seem different colors.  A person's actions are like the dust.  They make a person's life seem happy or sad, but it's not really who they are inside. When a person learns the truth, the dust is gone, and their true self shines through."

Bhishma told a story about Vritra, a powerful demon.  Vritra had lost a big battle and lost everything.  His teacher, Usanas, asked him, "Are you sad about losing?"

Vritra said, "No. I understand that everyone is born, lives, and dies.  People go to heaven or hell, but they always come back to life.  It's all because of what they do. We are all bound by our desires.  Good actions lead to good things, bad actions to bad things. People are born again and again until they understand this."

Usanas said, "Vritra, why are you saying such things?"

Vritra said, "I worked very hard to become powerful, but I lost it all because of my own actions.  But I'm not sad. I'm not afraid. I saw the great god Vishnu during the battle, and that was a great blessing.  I want to know more. How can someone become truly free from this cycle of life and death?"

Bhishma then said, "Listen carefully to what Usanas, the wise teacher, told Vritra..."
