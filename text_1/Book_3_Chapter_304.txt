Once upon a time, Princess Kunti learned some magic words, some powerful mantras, from a wise man.  When the wise man was gone, Kunti wanted to see if the mantras really worked.

One morning, Kunti felt grown-up feelings she wasn't ready for. She was surprised and a little scared.  As she sat on her bed, she looked at the sun rising.  Suddenly, she could see things no one else could!

She saw a shining god, the Sun God himself! He was strong and beautiful, with golden skin and shining armor.  He had come because of her magic words!

The Sun God was very kind.  He told Kunti he was there because of her mantras, and asked what she wanted. Kunti, feeling shy and embarrassed, just wanted him to go away.

But the Sun God said it wasn't right to call a god and then send him away without a reason. He offered Kunti a special gift: a strong and brave son, just like him.  He asked Kunti to be his wife for one night.

Kunti was very worried. She told the Sun God that she was too young to be a wife. She said it was wrong. She explained she only called him to test the magic words, it was just a game. She said that only her parents could decide who she would marry.

The Sun God was angry at first, because the other gods were laughing at him for being tricked by a young girl. But he was also understanding. He said, "Because you are young, I will be kind. But you must choose. Do you want a wonderful son?"

Kunti still said no. She valued her honor and goodness more than anything. Finally, the Sun God agreed to go away, but he promised her the son anyway, understanding that she hadn't broken any rules and was a very good girl.  And that's how Kunti got her special son, even without being the Sun God's wife!
