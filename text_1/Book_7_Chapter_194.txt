Once upon a time, in a great war, a mighty warrior named Drona was killed.  This made the Kaurava army very sad and scared.  They were like a herd of scared animals!

They cried and shook.  Their eyes filled with tears.  They were covered in dust.  They looked around wildly, their voices trembling.  Duryodhana, the Kaurava prince, was surrounded by his frightened soldiers. He couldn't even stay with them; they were too scared!  They were hungry, thirsty, and hot from the sun.

It was like the sun falling from the sky, or the ocean drying up! Everyone was terrified.  One by one, the Kaurava leaders ran away â€“ Sakuni, Salya, Kripa, Kritavarman, Uluka, even Duhsasana and Vrishasena! They all fled, taking their soldiers with them.  The whole army scattered, like leaves in a strong wind.  It looked like the Kaurava army was completely gone!

Only Drona's son, Ashwatthama, stayed to fight bravely.  He fought hard, but when he saw his army running away, he went to find Duryodhana. He asked, "Why is everyone running?  Why don't you stop them?" Duryodhana was too sad to answer.  He was heartbroken.  He was so ashamed that he asked Kripa to explain what happened.

Kripa explained that Drona had been fighting very bravely. He even used a powerful magic weapon!  He killed many, many enemy soldiers. But the Pandavas tricked Drona.  They told him that his son, Ashwatthama, was dead.  It was a lie, but Drona believed it.  He was so sad he stopped fighting.  Then, someone cut off his head.

Hearing this, Ashwatthama was furious! He was as angry as a snake stepped on. He was like a raging fire, ready to fight back!  He gritted his teeth, his eyes red with anger.  The battle was far from over!
