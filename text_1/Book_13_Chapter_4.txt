Once upon a time, long, long ago, there was a king named Gadhi. He wanted a son very badly.  He prayed and prayed, but instead, he got a beautiful daughter named Satyavati.

A very holy man named Richika wanted to marry Satyavati.  But King Gadhi thought Richika was too poor!  He said, "If you can give me a thousand special horses, you can marry my daughter."

Richika was clever. He asked the water god, Varuna, for help.  Varuna magically created a thousand amazing horses! Each horse was as white as the moon, but had one black ear. Richika gave the horses to King Gadhi.  Gadhi was amazed and let Richika marry Satyavati.

Satyavati and Richika were very happy.  Richika offered Satyavati a special gift: she could ask for anything.  Satyavati wanted to ask for a son for her mother too.

Richika gave Satyavati and her mother special food for a magical ceremony. He said this food would help them each have a son.  But Satyavati's mother was very clever! She switched the food with Satyavati.

Richika was upset when he found out. He had meant for Satyavati to have a son who was a wise holy man (Brahmana), and for her mother to have a strong warrior son (Kshatriya). Because of the switch, it was the other way around! Satyavati was sad, but eventually she had a son named Jamadagni. Her mother had a son named Viswamitra.

Even though Viswamitra was born a warrior, he became a very holy man, just like the Brahmanas. He had many sons, who also became great and holy men. That's the story of how Viswamitra became a great holy man, even though he wasn't born one!
