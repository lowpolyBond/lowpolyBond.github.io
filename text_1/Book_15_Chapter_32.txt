After sunset, everyone went to see Vyasa, a very wise man.  King Dhritarashtra, the Pandavas (the good guys), and many wise people sat together.  The queens and Gandhari, the queen mother, sat separately.  Everyone in the kingdom was there, even the people from faraway places.

Vyasa, a very powerful sage, had bathed in the holy river Bhagirathi.  He called up all the warriors who had died in the big war!  Suddenly, there was a HUGE noise from the river, like the sounds of the battle itself!

From the river, warriors rose up!  There was Bhishma and Drona, great leaders from both sides.  Thousands of soldiers came out, too!  Arjuna and Karna, Draupadi's sons, and many, many more.  Even Ghatotkacha, the powerful demon warrior, rose from the water.  All of them came out of the river, wearing shiny clothes and looking magnificent!

They all looked happy and peaceful, not angry like they were during the war.  Beautiful singing and music filled the air.  Pretty fairies called Apsaras danced around them.

Vyasa, using his special powers, gave King Dhritarashtra a special vision.  He could see all the people who had died, including his sons!  Gandhari, his wife, saw her sons, too.  Everyone there was amazed and happy. It looked like a huge, joyful party!  It was so beautiful and wonderful, it seemed like a picture painted in the sky.  Dhritarashtra was very happy to see all his warriors again.
