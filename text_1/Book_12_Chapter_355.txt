A wise man told a priest a story.  "Listen," he said, "long ago, in a special forest called Naimisha, near a river, there was a city.  This city was home to many amazing people, including a kind snake-person named Padmanabha.

Long ago, even the gods had a big party there!  A great king named Mandhatri even beat the god Indra!  Padmanabha is very special. He is wise and good. He helps everyone. He's kind and fair.  He uses clever ways to help good people and stop bad people. He is like a super-smart, super-kind snake!

He knows everything about being good. He loves guests and is always ready to help them. He’s rich, but he gives lots of things away. He always eats last, after everyone else. He never hurts anyone. He’s like the purest water in the clearest lake!

Go see him," the wise man said. "Ask him your questions. He will tell you what's really important in life."
