Once upon a time, there was a very strong and brave warrior named Rama.  He was so strong that everyone admired him!  Narada, a wise man, told a story about Rama.

Rama was a wonderful warrior. He got rid of all the bad people in the land.  He was super rich and successful. But even though he was amazing, something sad happened.  His father was killed, and someone stole his special cow.

Rama was very angry. He fought bravely against the bad guys who had done these terrible things. He was so brave, he defeated armies and armies of soldiers!  He fought with his bow and arrow, his sword, and even a club!  He fought so hard that rivers of blood flowed.  He was like a superhero, winning battles across the land!

Rama was a very good person. He gave lots of gifts to wise people called Brahmins. He performed many important ceremonies and gave away lots of gold and jewels.  He even gave away the entire land to the Brahmins!

A wise man named Kasyapa was very happy with Rama.  But then Kasyapa asked Rama to leave the earth. Rama obeyed and went to live on a tall mountain.

Narada finished his story and said, "Even Rama, the greatest of heroes, will die one day.  Everyone dies, even the bravest and best."  He was trying to comfort someone who was sad about losing someone important.  Even the greatest heroes, like Rama, have to leave this world someday.
