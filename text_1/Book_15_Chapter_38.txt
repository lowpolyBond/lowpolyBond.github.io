King Yudhishthira was very sad.  His father, the king, had died!  He died in a terrible forest fire.  It was so strange! His father was strong, like ten thousand elephants! He had a hundred strong sons!  Yet, he was burned to ashes.

Yudhishthira said, "Imagine!  A great king, who did so many good things, died like that! He was fanned by beautiful women before, but now vultures fanned him with their wings!  He slept on soft beds, and now he slept on the hard ground.  I feel terrible about this."

His stepmother, Gandhari, also lost all her sons in the war.  But Yudhishthira wasn't so sad for her. She was with his father now.  But Yudhishthira was heartbroken for his mother, Kunti.  She lived a wonderful life, but now she too died in the fire.

"It's all so unfair!" cried Yudhishthira.  "Arjuna, my brother, pleased the fire god long ago.  But the fire god didn't remember this and burned our mother!  She must have been so scared.  She called out for me and for Bhima.  She loved Sahadeva the most. He couldn't save her."

Everyone started to cry.  The five Pandava brothers were so sad, they looked like the world was ending.  Their cries filled the palace and went up to the sky.  It was a very, very sad day.
