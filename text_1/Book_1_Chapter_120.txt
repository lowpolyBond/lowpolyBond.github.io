Once upon a time, Prince Pandu was very sad. He couldn't have any children.  He felt very bad about this.  He went to live with holy men in the mountains. He became very good at being quiet and peaceful. The holy men loved him. Some called him brother, some friend, some son! He was so good, he was almost like a great holy man himself!

One day, the holy men decided to visit a special place. They invited Pandu to go with them.  Pandu wanted to go too, but he asked, "How can my wives come? The way is very dangerous. It's full of high mountains and snow! Even birds can't fly over some parts!"

The holy men said, "Your wives can't come. It's too hard."  

But Pandu was very upset. He said, "I need sons!  Without sons, I can't go to a good place after I die.  I have to do what is right for my family. I owe it to my ancestors to have children."

The holy men said, "Don't worry, Pandu!  You will have children. It's your destiny!"

Pandu thought about this. He knew he couldn't have children himself because of a magic curse.  He went to his wife Kunti and said, "Kunti, we need to have children.  I can't, so you must ask a holy man for help."

He explained that there are different ways to have children, even if you can't have them the usual way.  He told her a story about a woman who asked a holy man for help and had strong sons.  He asked Kunti to do the same.  He knew that having children was very important, and he wanted to do what he could to fulfill his duty.
