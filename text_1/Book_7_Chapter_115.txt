Once upon a time, during a big battle, many warriors attacked Satyaki, a brave fighter.  Drona shot many arrows at him!  Durmarshana, Duhsasana, Vikarna, Durmukha, and Chitrasena also shot lots of arrows. Even Duryodhana and many other heroes threw arrows at Satyaki like a rain shower!

But Satyaki was super strong! He fought back! He shot arrows at Drona, Duhsasana, Vikarna, Chitrasena, Durmarshana, and many others. He even shot arrows at Duryodhana himself!  They both shot so many arrows that they couldn't even see each other!

Satyaki was hurt, but he didn't give up. He looked amazing even with blood flowing down. Duryodhana also looked great, even though he was hurt too!  Then, Krishna (Madhava) cleverly broke Duryodhana's bow! Duryodhana got a new bow, and the fight went on!

Duryodhana's brothers tried to help, but Satyaki kept fighting. He shot so many arrows that he broke Duryodhana's bow again! He even knocked down Duryodhana's chariot and driver!  Duryodhana was scared and ran away!  Everyone was shouting and scared.

Another strong warrior, Kritavarman, came to help Duryodhana.  He shot lots of arrows at Satyaki, but Satyaki was too strong! He fought back and shot so many arrows that he hurt Kritavarman's chariot and even made him fall!

Even though he was hurt, Satyaki was brave and kept fighting. He was like a strong lion, pushing through the battle! After this big fight, Kritavarman got a new bow and kept on fighting the Pandavas.  The battle was far from over!
