King Yudhishthira was curious.  He asked Bhishma, a very wise man, "Why do people give umbrellas and sandals at special ceremonies?  What does it mean?"

Bhishma said, "I'll tell you a story!  Long ago, a powerful priest named Jamadagni was practicing archery. His wife, Renuka, would pick up his arrows. One day, the sun was very hot. Renuka had to sit under a tree to cool down while she gathered the arrows.  She was late getting back."

Jamadagni was angry! He yelled at Renuka.  Renuka explained that the sun was so hot, it burned her head and feet.

Jamadagni was furious!  He shouted, "I'll destroy the sun!" He aimed his magical bow at the sun.

Suddenly, the sun appeared as a kind Brahmin man.  "Why are you angry?" he asked. "The sun gives rain, which helps plants grow.  Plants give us food, and food gives us life!  Everything good comes from food! Please don't destroy me!"

Jamadagni listened. He understood.  The sun was important! To show respect for the sun's gift of food, and to remember Renuka's discomfort, people started giving umbrellas (for shade) and sandals (for comfort) at ceremonies. This showed they understood the importance of the sun and appreciated the gift of food.  That's why we still do it today!
