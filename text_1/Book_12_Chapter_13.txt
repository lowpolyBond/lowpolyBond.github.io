Once upon a time, Sahadeva, a wise prince, talked to his brother.  He said, "Just getting rid of your toys and things isn't enough to be truly happy.  Even if you don't want those things anymore, but you still *think* about them in your head, you're not truly free."

He explained, "Imagine two words: 'mine' and 'not mine'. 'Mine' is a short word, and it leads to sadness and death. 'Not mine' is a longer word, and it leads to happiness and peace, like being a friend to everyone.  Good and bad things happen to everyone, but it's up to us to choose how we think about them."

Sahadeva continued, "Some people believe that when our bodies die, our souls live on forever.  Others think that when our bodies die, our souls die too. If our souls die too, then all the good things we do donâ€™t matter.  But if our souls live on, then we should always try to be kind and good."

He said, "A king who rules the whole world but isn't happy is a sad king. And a person who lives in the forest, eating only berries and roots, but is still sad and worried about things, is also unhappy.  They are both trapped by their own thoughts!"

Sahadeva looked at his brother and said, "Think of everyone as part of your family.  If you love everyone, you won't be afraid of anything bad happening.  You are my brother, my teacher, my protector. I'm sad, and I might have said silly things. Please forgive me."
