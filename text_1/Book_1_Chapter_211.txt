Once upon a time, long, long ago, two brothers named Sunda and Upasunda were born.  They were super strong and powerful, like giants!  Their dad was a really powerful demon, too.

Sunda and Upasunda were best friends. They did everything together. They wanted to rule the whole world! So they went to the Vindhya mountains. There, they did super hard exercises to become even stronger. They went without food and water for a very long time.  They even hurt themselves!

The gods were worried!  These brothers were getting too powerful.  The gods tried to trick them with beautiful gifts and pretty girls, but Sunda and Upasunda didn't give up!  They even ignored fake scary monsters trying to hurt their family!

Finally, the greatest god of all, Brahma, came to see them. He asked what they wanted.

"We want to be super strong, able to change into anything, and… we want to be immortal!" they said.

Brahma said, "I can give you everything except immortality. You can choose how you die.  But because you only did all this hard work to become powerful, I can't make you live forever."

Sunda and Upasunda thought for a moment.  Then they said, "Let us only be able to be killed by each other!"

Brahma agreed. He gave them all the other powers. They were now super strong and could change into anything!  They went back home and celebrated. They had amazing parties every day.  They were so powerful and happy, they didn’t even notice time passing by!  They had so much fun, a whole year felt like just one day!
