Once upon a time, in the land of Bharat, a good king named Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandpa, how can a king be good and go to heaven after he dies?"

Bhishma smiled. "A good king is kind and generous," he said. "He gives to others and worships the gods. He protects his people and always does what is right. He stands up for good people and gives them gifts.  He's like a strong tree protecting birds, or a cloud bringing rain to thirsty plants. He is fair to everyone.  He must punish bad people, like thieves, and never let them go free."

Bhishma explained, "A good king shares in the good things his people do.  If his people are good, he gets some of that goodness. But if his people do bad things because the king isn't doing his job, then he gets some of that badness too!  If someone is robbed, the king must help them get their things back.  He must always protect the good people, especially wise people called Brahmins."

Yudhishthira said, "I don't want to be king just for myself. I only want to be king to be good! But being a good king sounds hard. Maybe I should just leave and become a hermit in the forest!"

Bhishma said, "My dear Yudhishthira, you are kind and gentle. But a king needs to be brave and strong, too! Your father and mother wanted you to be brave and generous.  Being kind is good, but you also need to protect your people! Itâ€™s better to try your best, even if you make a few mistakes, than to do nothing at all.  Use your strength to help the weak, and kindness to win over others."

Bhishma continued, "The best way to go to heaven is by helping people who are scared.  Be a strong and kind king!  Protect the good, and fight the bad. Let your people rely on you for help and protection, like birds in a big tree, or animals looking for rain!"


Yudhishthira understood.  Being a good king meant being both kind and strong, brave and fair. He knew he needed to use his power to help his people, and that was the best way to be a truly good king.
