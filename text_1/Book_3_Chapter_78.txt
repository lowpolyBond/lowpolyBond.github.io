King Nala, a strong and brave man, went to visit his brother, Pushkara.  Pushkara was the king of Nishadha.  He had lost everything – his kingdom, his wife Damayanti, and all his wealth – in a dice game with Nala!

Pushkara was angry. He wanted to play again. "Let's gamble!" he shouted. "I'll bet everything I've won back, even Damayanti! You can bet your kingdom!"

Nala smiled. "Okay," he said, "let's play!"

This time, Nala was lucky! With one roll of the dice, he won back everything Pushkara had won – the kingdom, Damayanti, and all the riches!

Pushkara was upset, but Nala was kind. "You're my brother," Nala said. "I'm giving you your life, and a part of the kingdom to rule. Let's forget this game."

Pushkara was happy. He thanked Nala and went home to his part of the kingdom.  Everyone was excited to see him back!

Nala went back to his palace. Everyone in his kingdom was so happy to have their good king back! They cheered and celebrated, very happy to be under his kind rule.  Nala was a great king, and everyone loved him.
