Once upon a time, a princess named Savitri married a kind man named Satyavan.  A wise man had told Savitri that Satyavan would die in three days.  Savitri was very sad.

She decided to pray really hard.  She fasted for three days and nights!  Her father worried about her.  "This is too hard!" he said.  But Savitri said, "I will keep praying!" She looked very thin and weak.

The day Satyavan was supposed to die finally came. Savitri woke up early. She prayed and offered gifts to the gods.  The wise people at her home wished her good luck, hoping she wouldn't become a widow. Savitri was very quiet and serious. She knew what was coming.

Satyavan went to chop wood in the forest. Savitri wanted to go with him. Satyavan said, "You're too weak from your fast! The forest is hard to walk through!"  But Savitri was determined.  She convinced her father and mother-in-law to let her go.  They agreed, hoping she would have peace of mind.

Savitri walked with Satyavan. She smiled, but her heart was heavy. She remembered the wise man's words. She knew her husband was going to die that very day. She walked beside him,  loving him with all her heart. She was ready for what was going to happen.
