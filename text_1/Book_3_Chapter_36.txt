Once upon a time, the Pandavas were worried.  Bhima, the strong one, wanted to fight the Kauravas right away!  He was angry and ready to rumble.

Yudhishthira, the wise king, thought carefully.  He knew fighting the Kauravas would be hard.  They had many powerful warriors: Bhishma, Drona, Karna, and many more!  These warriors were brave and skilled, and they had many soldiers and lots of treasures.  Yudhishthira knew defeating them would be very difficult.

He told Bhima, "It's true we're angry, but rushing into battle without a plan is dangerous.  We must be clever and plan carefully."

Just then, their wise grandfather, Vyasa, appeared! He knew what Yudhishthira was worried about. Vyasa said, "Don't worry! I have a plan."

Vyasa told Yudhishthira that Arjuna, the best archer, needed to get special weapons from the gods.  Arjuna was strong and brave; he would get magical weapons to help win the battle.

Vyasa also said the Pandavas should move to a new forest.  Staying in the same place for too long might cause problems.

Vyasa shared his wisdom with Yudhishthira. Yudhishthira listened carefully.  Feeling much better, the Pandavas moved to a new forest.  They practiced their archery skills, prayed, and lived peacefully, getting ready for the great battle ahead.  They were getting stronger and smarter, ready to face the Kauravas one day.
