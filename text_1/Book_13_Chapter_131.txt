Long ago, in a land filled with magic, powerful gods and wise people asked some special night creatures, called Pramathas, a question.  These Pramathas were like friendly ghosts, but sometimes they made people sick.

The gods asked, "Why do you make people sick? What makes you unable to hurt someone?"

The Pramathas answered, "We don't like people who are messy!  We don't like people who don't wash after doing certain things, or who are mean to others.  We don't like people who eat lots of meat without thinking, or who sleep in weird positions, or who sleep with dirty things under their pillows.  People who are messy and disrespectful are easy for us to bother!"

"But," the Pramathas said, "there are things that keep us away! People who are always clean, and who are kind, are safe.  If someone keeps a special yellow powder (Gorochana) on them, or carries certain lucky items (Vachas), we can't hurt them.  If they offer gifts of good things, or keep a special fire burning in their homes, or keep a cat or goat, we stay away!"

"Homes with a burning fire, or the skin or teeth of a wolf, or a hill-tortoise are also safe from us," the Pramathas explained. "We told you everything. Now you know how to protect yourselves!"  And so the gods and wise people learned how to keep the Pramathas away.
