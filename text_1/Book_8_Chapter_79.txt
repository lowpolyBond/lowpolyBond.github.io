Arjuna was a great warrior. He fought bravely against the enemy.  He fought so hard that a river of blood flowed!  It was a terrible sight.  The river was full of bones, broken weapons, and the bodies of fallen soldiers.  Ravens and vultures cried above.  Even the broken parts of helmets and jewelry floated on the bloody water.

Arjuna saw Karna, the enemy's leader.  He wanted to fight Karna.  "Krishna," he said, "I see Karna's flag!  Bhima and the others are fighting him.  The Pancala soldiers are running away because they are scared of Karna. King Duryodhana is there too, looking very proud.  Karna, Kripa, Kritavarma, and Drona's son are all protecting him."

Arjuna asked Krishna to take him to Karna.  "I won't come back until I defeat Karna!" he vowed.

Krishna drove Arjuna's chariot towards Karna.  The chariot made a loud noise, like thunder!

The king of Madras saw Arjuna coming.  He warned Karna, "Arjuna is here! He's strong. If you defeat him, we will win!"

Karna was brave.  "Don't worry," he said. "I will defeat Arjuna and all the Pandavas! I will either win this battle, or die trying!"

Shalya, Karna's charioteer, was worried.  "Even alone, Arjuna is unbeatable," he warned. "With Krishna helping him, who can defeat him?"

But Karna insisted.  "Arjuna is the greatest warrior ever!  But I will fight him!  He's powerful, he never sweats, and heâ€™s incredibly fast with his arrows.  He's got magical weapons!  He even got his bow, Gandiva, from the god of fire!  He's got help from Krishna too.  Krishna is like a god himself! But I'm the bravest of all!  I will fight him!"

Karna ordered his army to attack Arjuna and tire him out.  Then Karna would finish him off.

Arjuna fought like a whirlwind!  Arrows flew everywhere. Soldiers, horses, and elephants fell.  The Kaurava army couldn't even look at Arjuna; he was too powerful.

Arjuna fought off Kripa, Kritavarma, and Drona's son. He was amazing!  He used his arrows to cut down their bows, horses, and even their leaders!

Arjuna fought so hard that the Kaurava army scattered, like a wall collapsing.  His friends like Shikhandi, Satyaki, and the twins helped him.  The battle was fierce, and many warriors died.  The battlefield was dark with smoke and dust from the battle.
