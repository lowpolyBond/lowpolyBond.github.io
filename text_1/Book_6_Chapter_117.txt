Once upon a time, in a great battle, Abhimanyu, Arjuna's brave son, fought really hard.  He wanted to help his grandfather, Bhishma.  Duryodhana, the enemy prince, was angry. He shot many arrows at Abhimanyu, hitting him in the chest.

Abhimanyu was furious! He threw a super-strong spear at Duryodhana's chariot.  But Duryodhana was a great warrior too. He used a sharp arrow to cut the spear in half!  Then Abhimanyu shot many arrows at Duryodhana, hitting his arms and chest.

Another brave warrior, Aswatthaman, got angry and shot many arrows at Satyaki. Satyaki fought back with even more arrows!  They kept shooting arrows at each other.

Two other warriors, Dhrishtaketu and Paurava, also fought a huge battle. They shot so many arrows that they broke each other's bows! Then, they fought with swords!  They were so strong, they both fell down!  Jayatsena and Sahadeva helped them get up.

Chitrasena and Susarman also fought a big battle, shooting lots and lots of arrows at each other.  

Abhimanyu fought another warrior, Vrihadvala.  They both shot many arrows, broke each other's bows, and fought really hard.

Bhima, a very strong warrior, fought against many elephants! He was so strong, he made many elephants fall down.

Yudhishthira fought the king of Madras, and they both shot arrows at each other.  The king of Sindhus fought Virata, and Virata fought Jayadratha.

Drona and Dhrishtadyumna fought fiercely! They shot arrows, and broke each other's bows. Dhrishtadyumna even threw a giant mace, but Drona broke it with arrows!

Arjuna fought against Bhishma.  Bhishma was a very powerful warrior. He shot so many arrows that many warriors fell! He was like a big fire, burning everything in his path.  But Arjuna and Sikhandin fought bravely against him.  Bhishma was so strong, only Arjuna and Sikhandin dared to fight him.  Many, many warriors died fighting Bhishma.


This was a very big and scary battle with lots of brave warriors and lots of arrows!
