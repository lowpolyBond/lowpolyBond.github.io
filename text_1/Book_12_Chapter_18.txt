Once upon a time, after a long, serious talk, Arjuna was very sad.  He spoke to his older brother, Yudhishthira.  "Brother," he said, "I remember an old story.  It’s about King Janaka and his queen."

King Janaka was a great king, but one day he gave up everything! He left his kingdom, his riches, his family, and even his comfortable home. He shaved his head, put on simple clothes, and became a beggar.  He decided to live on just a few grains of barley he could find scattered in the fields.

His queen was very upset. She found him alone and said, "My king, why have you done this?  A few barley grains aren’t fit for a king like you! You left your beautiful kingdom for this?  How will you feed your guests, or honor the gods? You used to help so many people – Brahmins, and everyone else! Now you're begging from them!  You've made your mother sad, and you've made me a widow. All your people depend on you! What good will this do you?"

The queen was angry, but also very wise.  She told him, "A king should be like a big, strong tree, giving shelter to everyone.  Even a strong elephant can be eaten by other animals if it stops doing its work! You are powerful, but doing nothing will make you weak."

She asked him, "Is a kingdom and a handful of barley the same thing? If they are, why did you leave your kingdom? If it's not, then you haven't really given everything up!"  She explained that true giving isn't just about leaving things behind; it's about helping others.

"True happiness," she said, "comes from helping those in need. Real beggars are those who are truly selfless, not those who just wear simple clothes. You should rule your kingdom and help your people! That's the best way to be happy and good."

Arjuna finished his story, saying, "Even King Janaka, a wise man, made a mistake. We must always remember to help others, be kind, and never give up hope. That’s how we’ll be truly happy and go to a good place after we die."
