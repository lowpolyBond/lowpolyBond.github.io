King Dhritarashtra was worried. He asked his advisor, Sanjaya, "Drona, the great warrior, was fighting the Pandavas!  How did they stop him? Who protected Drona's chariot?  So many soldiers were fighting! How did Drona, who was so strong, finally die?"

Sanjaya explained, "After defeating a king, Arjuna (Partha) and Satyaki went to fight Drona. Yudhishthira, Bhima, Nakula, Sahadeva, Dhrishtadyumna, Virata, and many other kings and their armies also attacked Drona!  Even Draupadi's sons and Ghatotkacha, a powerful giant, joined the fight.  Thousands of soldiers fought bravely against Drona.

The battle was fierce! That night, it was very dark.  It was so scary! Jackals howled, owls hooted, and the sounds of fighting were terrifying. Elephants trumpeted, horses neighed, and soldiers shouted.  It was so dark that friends and enemies couldn't see each other!  The ground was covered in dust and blood.  But the shiny armor and jewels of the warriors made the night a little brighter.

The sounds of the battle were incredibly loud â€“ like thunder!  It was like a huge storm.  Drona was very strong, but many Pandava warriors fought bravely against him.  Drona was surrounded, but he fought on and on, killing thousands of soldiers, elephants, and horses. In the end, it was the combined power of all the Pandavas that led to Drona's death."
