Once upon a time, King Santanu's wife, Satyavati, was very sad. Her son had died.  She was heartbroken.  She cried with her daughters-in-law and Bhishma, her stepson, who was a very brave warrior.

Satyavati looked at Bhishma and said, "Bhishma, my dear son, everything depends on you now.  Our family's future, and keeping our ancestors happy, is in your hands. You are wise and good, like the wisest teachers. You know what is right and wrong.  My son died without children. His wives, the beautiful princesses, want children.  Please, help us.  Become king.  Marry and have children to keep our family going. Don't let our family line end."

Bhishma was a good man, but he had made a promise a long time ago:  he would never have children.  He told Satyavati, "Mother, I know what you want, and it’s the right thing, but I can't break my promise.  I would rather give up everything in the world than break my word."  He explained that his promise was more important to him than anything. He said he would rather give up everything — even becoming king — than break his promise.

Satyavati was still very upset. She begged Bhishma, "My dear son, please! Think of what is best for our family. We can't let our family name disappear."

Bhishma said, "Mother, don't make me do something wrong!  Breaking a promise is wrong, especially for a warrior like me. But don't worry, I will find another way to save our family line. We will ask the wise people what we should do."

So, Satyavati and Bhishma decided to ask the wise men for advice to solve this problem, and keep everyone happy.
