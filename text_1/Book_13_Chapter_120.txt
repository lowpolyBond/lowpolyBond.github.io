King Yudhishthira asked his grandfather Bhishma, "Grandpa, what's better: being smart, doing good deeds, or giving gifts?"

Bhishma told a story.  "Long ago," he said, "a wise man named Maitreya met Krishna, who was traveling in disguise. Krishna ate a delicious meal Maitreya gave him and laughed happily.  Maitreya asked, 'Why are you so happy? I do good deeds, but you seem even better than me!'"

Then Bhishma explained what Vyasa, a very wise person, said. Vyasa said, "The best things a person can do are: never hurt anyone, always tell the truth, and give gifts. Even a small, kind gift is very powerful. Krishna, by giving Maitreya that food, did something wonderful!  Giving is better than doing other good things or being smart.  Giving makes you happy, and happy people make the world a better place.  People who give are kind and good."

Vyasa continued, "There are three kinds of people: good, bad, and those who are neither. People who give, do good deeds and pray are good. People who hurt others are bad.  Everything else doesn't really matter. So, Yudhishthira, be happy, give gifts, and be kind.  Then, you'll be better than anyone who's only smart or who just does good deeds!"
