Once upon a time, a prince named Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandpa, what's the best thing for someone who doesn't know much about being good, who's always confused, and doesn't try very hard to be a good person?"

Bhishma smiled.  "My dear prince," he said, "the best things are to respect your teachers, be kind to old people, and listen carefully when wise people talk about good things."  Bhishma then told a story about Galava and Narada.

Galava was a young man who wanted to know what was the best way to live. He asked Narada, a very wise and holy man, "Everyone says different things about how to live a good life!  The books say different things, and people follow different rules. How can I know what's really best?"

Narada said, "There are four different ways of life, and they are all good.  But what truly matters is being kind to your friends, standing up to bullies, and finding a good balance between doing what’s right, getting what you need, and having fun. "

Narada continued, "Being honest, kind to everyone, and always using nice words are really important. Share what you have with others, especially the needy.  Being humble is important too. Don't brag about yourself; good people don't need to boast.  The sun shines brightly without shouting about it!  Learn and study hard.  Don't waste your time on silly things. Don't be lazy or mean.  Don't try to make yourself look better by putting others down."

Narada explained that it’s best to live among good people who are kind and honest.  "Live where people help each other and follow the rules," he said. "Stay away from places where people are mean or cheat others. Avoid places where people are unkind to wise teachers or ignore what they learn."

Narada finished by saying, "The best way to live is to be kind and helpful to everyone. Do your best to be good and honest, and good things will come to you. The greatest thing is to be wise and kind."
