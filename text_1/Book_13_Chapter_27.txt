Once upon a time, a prince named Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, a very important question.  He wanted to know if someone who wasn't born a Brahmin could become one.  Brahmins were like the special priests and teachers.

Bhishma said, "No, Yudhishthira.  You can't *become* a Brahmin.  It's something you're born into after many, many lives."

Bhishma then told a story.  A man named Matanga was raised as a Brahmin, even though his parents weren't.  One day, he was driving a cart pulled by a young donkey.  He was mean to the donkey and hit it on its nose.

The donkey's mother saw this.  She was very upset!  "Don't be sad, little one," she told the donkey.  "That man is not a real Brahmin.  He's a Chandala!  Real Brahmins are kind to everyone.  He's cruel because he's not really a Brahmin."

Matanga was shocked. He asked the donkey how she knew.  The donkey explained that his mother was a Brahmin woman, but his father was a barber, who wasn't a Brahmin.  This made Matanga a Chandala.

Matanga was very sad. He went home and told his father what happened. He decided to do very hard and difficult exercises to try and become a Brahmin.  He was so determined that even the gods noticed!  A powerful god, Indra, appeared and told Matanga to stop.

Indra said, "Matanga, you can't become a Brahmin. It's impossible.  You can't change who you are born as, no matter how hard you try."  Matanga learned that some things are impossible to change, even with lots of hard work.
