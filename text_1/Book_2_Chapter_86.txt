Deep in the forest lived Guha.  He saw Prince Lakshmana watching over his sleeping brother, Rama, and Sita. Guha was kind. He tried to comfort Lakshmana.  "Prince," Guha said, "please rest! We'll watch over Rama.  He's so important to us. You deserve comfort."

But Lakshmana wouldn't rest. "How can I be comfortable," he said, "when Rama and Sita sleep on the hard ground?  My father, the King, is heartbroken that Rama is gone. My mother will be very sad.  I worry about them.  Will my father even live to see Rama return? Will the beautiful city of Ayodhya still be happy when Rama comes back?"  Lakshmana was very worried about his family.

Lakshmana kept watch all night with his bow and arrow.  When the sun rose, Lakshmana and Rama's hair was messy. Guha helped them cross the river Ganges safely.

Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita, strong and brave, walked away. They looked back at Guha. They looked like strong elephants heading off to a journey.
