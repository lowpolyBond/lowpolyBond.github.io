Long ago, a brave warrior named Bhishma fought many battles and won.  He captured three beautiful princesses. He brought them to his mother, Satyavati.

Bhishma told his mother, "I won these princesses for my brother, Vichitravirya."

Satyavati was very happy. She hugged Bhishma and said, "You did a wonderful thing, my son!"

But the oldest princess wasn't happy. She was shy and spoke to Bhishma.  She said, "Bhishma, you know what's right and wrong. I already promised to marry a king from Salwa. He already asked for my hand in marriage, secretly! How can I marry you when my heart belongs to someone else?"

The princess begged Bhishma to let her go.  She said, "You're known for being fair and honest. Please, be kind and let me go to my true love."

Bhishma, who was always truthful and kind, listened carefully. He understood the princess's feelings.
