King Janamejaya asked, "How did Bhishma, the great warrior, die?  What special way did he leave his body?"

Vaisampayana said, "Listen closely! When the sun started its journey north, Bhishma used his special powers. He focused his mind.  He was lying on a bed of arrows, but he was very brave. He looked beautiful, like the sun shining brightly.  Many wise men were around him: Vyasa, Narada, and many, many more! They were all there to help him."

Bhishma spoke to Krishna, a powerful god.  He said, "Krishna, you are everywhere, always. You are the beginning and the end.  You are the greatest of all. Even the gods don't know everything about you. I want to be with you."

Bhishma talked about Krishna's many amazing forms. He said Krishna was like the sun, the moon, the wind, fire, and everything else in the world. He is the creator of everything. He is kind and powerful.

Bhishma praised Krishna for a long time. He thanked Krishna for everything. He was very devoted.  

Then, Bhishma closed his eyes. He thought of Krishna and he died peacefully. Krishna gave him heavenly wisdom before he left.

The wise men who were with Bhishma were sad, but they also praised Krishna and Bhishma. The Pandavas, the good princes, came in their chariots to take Bhishma away.  The earth shook as their chariots rolled along.  Bhishma went to heaven, happy and peaceful.
