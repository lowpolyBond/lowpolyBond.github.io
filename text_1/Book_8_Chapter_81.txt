Once upon a time, in a great battle, Arjuna, a brave warrior with a monkey flag on his chariot, was speeding towards Karna.  Ninety Kaurava warriors, angry and wanting to stop him, attacked!  They threw many arrows.  But Arjuna, with his super-fast chariot and his amazing skill, quickly defeated them all.  They fell to the ground, just like stars falling from the sky!

Then, even more Kaurava soldiers attacked Arjuna—on chariots, elephants, and horses!  They threw spears, swords, and arrows.  It looked like a huge storm of weapons! But Arjuna was like the sun, shining brightly and pushing away the darkness. He used his own arrows to defeat them all!

Next, thirteen hundred war elephants, very angry, attacked Arjuna from the side!  They threw more spears, arrows and all sorts of weapons!  But Arjuna, a very clever warrior, shot his arrows with great skill. He hit the elephants, their riders, and their flags! The elephants fell down, like huge mountains on fire!

Arjuna’s amazing arrows flew everywhere.  Horses and chariots fell all around.  Soldiers ran and fell.  It was a very loud and scary battle! Arjuna fought all alone and won against the many soldiers who attacked him from all sides!

Seeing Arjuna surrounded by enemies, his strong brother Bhima rushed to help! He swung his giant mace, a huge club, smashing through enemy soldiers and elephants.  The mace was so powerful, it was like the scary night of death itself!  Bhima defeated lots of soldiers and elephants.  

When Bhima finished, Arjuna then shot more arrows at the remaining Kaurava soldiers.  They were scared and ran away, shouting for help from Karna, their best warrior.  They hid behind Karna like scared little snakes!

Karna, brave and strong, saw his friends running and was angry. He tried to fight Arjuna, but many warriors attacked him too. Karna shot many arrows himself, but even his amazing power couldn't stop Arjuna completely. The battle was still raging.  Everyone was hurt! It was a truly amazing, and very loud, battle!
