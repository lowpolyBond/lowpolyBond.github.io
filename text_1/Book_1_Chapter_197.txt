King Drupada of Panchala was very happy.  His daughter, Draupadi, had been won in a contest! But he was confused.  The five princes who won her looked like holy men, Brahmins.  He asked Yudhishthira, "Are you really Brahmins, or are you someone else in disguise?"

Yudhishthira smiled. "Don't worry, King! We are Kshatriyas, warriors! We are the Pandava princes, sons of King Pandu. I am Yudhishthira, the eldest. These are my brothers, Bhima and Arjuna.  Nakula and Sahadeva are with our mother and Draupadi."

King Drupada was overjoyed!  He asked about their escape from the burning palace. Yudhishthira told him everything.  The king was angry at Dhritarashtra, who had tried to kill the Pandavas. He promised to help them get their kingdom back.

The Pandavas and Kunti stayed with King Drupada, who treated them with great respect. Then, Drupada said, "Arjuna, my son, marry Draupadi today!"

But Yudhishthira said, "I want to marry Draupadi too!"  He explained that their mother had decided Draupadi would marry all five brothers.

King Drupada was shocked! "That's never been done before! One woman can't marry many husbands!"

Yudhishthira said, "Our mother told us to, and we believe it's right. We always share everything equally."

King Drupada was still unsure. He said, "Let's talk about it with your mother, my son Dhrishtadyumna, and you."

So Yudhishthira, Kunti, and Dhrishtadyumna talked it over.  Just then, a wise old man, Vyasa, arrived.  He was going to help them decide what to do next!
