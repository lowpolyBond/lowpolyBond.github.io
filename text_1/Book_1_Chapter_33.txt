Once upon a time, a magical bird named Garuda wanted to get a special drink called Amrita.  It was guarded very carefully!

Garuda flew to where the Amrita was kept.  It was protected by a spinning, razor-sharp wheel like the sun!  But Garuda was clever. He shrank himself and zipped right through the wheel's spokes!

Next, two HUGE, fiery snakes guarded the Amrita. Their eyes were like burning coals, and one look could turn you to ash! But Garuda cleverly threw dust in their eyes.  Then, he quickly and bravely fought and defeated them.

He grabbed the Amrita. He didn't drink it; he wanted to give it to someone else!  Garuda flew away, so fast he almost blocked out the sun!

He met a powerful god named Vishnu. Vishnu was so happy with Garuda's kindness that he gave him two amazing gifts:  Garuda would always be above Vishnu (meaning very important!), and he would never get sick or die!

Garuda was so grateful, he gave Vishnu a gift too! He said Vishnu could ride on him!  Vishnu made Garuda his special flying horse.

Then, another powerful god, Indra, threw a super strong lightning bolt at Garuda!  But Garuda just laughed! He was too strong!  He threw a feather from his wing. Everyone was amazed by the beautiful feather.

Indra was impressed by Garuda's amazing power. He wanted to be friends with the strongest bird in the world!  And thatâ€™s how Garuda became friends with the gods.
