Once upon a time, a great warrior named Salya was coming to see the Pandavas. He had a HUGE army!  It was so big, it covered miles and miles of land.  His army had soldiers in shiny armor of all colors, with bright flags and fancy bows.  They even had lots of beautiful animals and carts!  The ground shook as they marched!

King Duryodhana, who was mean and wanted to fight the Pandavas, heard about Salya’s army. He rushed to greet him and threw a huge party! He built beautiful places with yummy food, drinks, and comfy rooms for Salya and his soldiers. Salya felt like a king! He was so happy, he thought he was even better than the king of the gods!

Salya asked who had prepared all the amazing feast. When he learned it was the Pandavas' people, he said he wanted to thank them and reward them generously.  Duryodhana, who had been hiding, then stepped out! Salya was surprised to see him. He hugged Duryodhana and said he could have anything he wanted.

Duryodhana asked Salya to be the leader of his army!  Salya agreed.  But Salya said, "I want to visit my nephews, the Pandavas, first.  I'll come back quickly."  Duryodhana agreed and went home.

Salya went to see the Pandavas. He was so happy to see them! He hugged them all. Then he chatted with Yudhishthira and praised him for being so brave and good. He reminded Yudhishthira that even gods go through hard times.

Then Salya told Yudhishthira about his promise to Duryodhana. Yudhishthira said, "Uncle Salya,  I need your help.  Karna, a strong warrior, will fight my brother Arjuna. You will be Karna’s charioteer.  Please help Arjuna win!"

Salya agreed. He promised to say things to Karna that would make him less confident during the battle, so Arjuna could win.  Salya wanted to help the Pandavas because he knew they had suffered a lot, and it was time for them to be happy again.
