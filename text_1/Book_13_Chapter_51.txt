Once upon a time, a wise holy man named Chyavana was in trouble. King Nahusha heard about it and wanted to help.  He went to Chyavana with his helpers and priests. They bowed respectfully.

Nahusha asked Chyavana, "Great holy man, what can I do for you?"

Chyavana pointed to some fishermen. "These fishermen have worked hard. Pay them fairly for my help."

Nahusha tried. He offered a thousand coins, then ten thousand, then a million!  But Chyavana said, "That's not enough.  It's not about money."

Nahusha was worried! He offered half his kingdom, then his whole kingdom!  Still, Chyavana said no.  Nahusha was very sad.

Then, a magical wise man appeared. He was born from a cow!  This wise man said, "Brahmins, holy people, are priceless. Cows are also very special.  A cow is the right payment for Chyavana."

Nahusha was overjoyed! He gave Chyavana a cow. Chyavana accepted it happily.  He said, "Cows are wonderful! They give us milk, food, and they're very lucky to have!"

The fishermen, who had caught lots of fish, were also happy! Because of Chyavana's magic words, they all went to heavenâ€”even the fish!

Nahusha was amazed. He thanked the wise men and gave them gifts. Chyavana went back to his home, and the cow-man went back to his.  Nahusha was happy because he learned how valuable cows and kindness are.  And that's the story!
