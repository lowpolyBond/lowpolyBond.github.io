The sun rose, and a big army got ready for battle!  Bhishma, a strong warrior, led the Kaurava army.  Drona, Duryodhana, and many other brave fighters were with him.  Their army was huge, with lots of elephants, horses, and soldiers.  The elephants carried colorful flags—red, yellow, black, and brown—that waved in the wind. The whole army looked amazing, like a stormy sky full of clouds.

This giant army charged towards Arjuna, like a powerful river rushing to the sea.  Arjuna, a very brave warrior, rode in his chariot, pulled by white horses.  He had a monkey on his flag!  He was surrounded by his own strong army.

The Kauravas were scared when they saw Arjuna and his army.  It was a massive group of soldiers, elephants, horses, and chariots.  Arjuna's army was so big and strong, it seemed like four thousand elephants guarded each side!

Then, BOOM!  The battle began!  Drums beat loudly.  Conches blew.  Trumpets played.  Soldiers shouted.  Thousands of arrows flew through the air. The sky filled with dust from the fighting.  It was a huge, exciting mess!  Soldiers fought on foot, on chariots, and on elephants.  Many warriors and animals fell to the ground.  Broken shields and weapons littered the battlefield.

While all this was happening, Bhishma saw Arjuna. He wanted to fight Arjuna, who had a monkey on his flag.  Many other warriors also wanted to fight the powerful Arjuna.  But then, Abhimanyu, Arjuna’s son, bravely joined the fight. He was super strong and fought back against the enemy warriors.

Finally, Bhishma and Arjuna faced each other.  Arjuna used his special bow, Gandiva.  It was so powerful, it made a loud noise like thunder!  Arjuna and Bhishma shot many arrows at each other. The battle was amazing to watch! Everyone watched Arjuna and Bhishma fight, shooting arrows back and forth.  It was a truly incredible battle!
