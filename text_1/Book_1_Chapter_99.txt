King Santanu was curious.  "Why did the Vasus, powerful gods, have to be born as humans?" he asked his wife, Ganga.

Ganga explained, "A long time ago, a wise man named Apava lived in a beautiful place. He had a special cow, Nandini, that gave everything you wished for!  The Vasus, eight powerful gods, were visiting with their wives. One of the Vasu's wives, really wanted Nandini for her friend. Her husband, Dyu, stole the cow!"

Apava was very angry when he found his cow missing. He cursed the Vasus, saying, "You will all be born as humans!"

The Vasus were sad. They asked Apava to forgive them.  Apava said, "You will be free from this curse after one year as humans. But Dyu, who stole the cow, will stay a human for much longer. He'll be a good person but won't have children or a wife."

The Vasus came to Ganga. They asked her to help them. Ganga promised to put each of them into the water as soon as they were born. This would help them go back to being gods quickly.

"Only Dyu will stay a human," Ganga told Santanu.  "He is the reason for the curse.  He is your son!"

Ganga then took her son, leaving King Santanu sad.  That son was very special.  His name was Devavrata, and he would be even greater than his father!  And that, friends, is a part of the great story of the Mahabharata.
