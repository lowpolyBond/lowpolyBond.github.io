King Drupada said, "There are many kinds of people.  The best are those who are wise and kind.  The Pandavas,  Yudhishthira and his brothers, are good people, but they've been tricked!  Dhritarashtra, their uncle, let his son Duryodhana cheat the Pandavas in a game.  Duryodhana is a bully who took everything from the Pandavas. He's very sneaky and good at games, even though Yudhishthira wasn't.

Drupada continued, "We need someone very smart and brave to go talk to Dhritarashtra. You are the perfect person! You are wise and respected. You know how to talk to important people. You can convince Dhritarashtra that what Duryodhana did was wrong. You're like a super-smart peacemaker!

If you speak nicely to Dhritarashtra, you might make his friends – even the powerful Bhishma and Drona – question his actions.  While everyone is confused, the Pandavas can get ready for battle.

You are a priest, so they will listen to you.  You are old and wise, so they'll respect you.  Please go, and help us. Go now, at the lucky time."


The wise priest agreed. He was a really smart guy who knew all about how to talk to rulers. He took his students and went to Hastinapura, the city of elephants, to help the Pandavas.
