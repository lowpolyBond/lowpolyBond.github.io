Long ago, in the land of Kuru, a brave warrior named Bhishma ruled.  His brother, Vichitravirya, was still a boy.  Bhishma was very kind and loyal. He promised to help his little brother.

Bhishma heard about a special wedding.  Three beautiful princesses were going to choose their husbands.  It was a big party! Kings from all over came to find a bride.

Bhishma went to the wedding. He wanted to find brides for his brother.  He was so strong and brave that he won the princesses for Vichitravirya!  He bravely fought all the other kings who also wanted the princesses.  It was a huge battle!  Many arrows flew through the air, but Bhishma was incredibly skilled, and he won!

One of the princesses, Amba, really wanted to marry a different king. She sadly told Bhishma about this.  Bhishma, being fair, let Amba go.  But his brother, Vichitravirya, married the other two princesses, Ambika and Ambalika.

Vichitravirya and his wives were very happy together. They lived happily for seven years. But sadly, Vichitravirya became very sick and died.  Bhishma was very sad. He made sure his brother had a proper goodbye.  Now Bhishma had to figure out what to do next.  This made him very worried.
