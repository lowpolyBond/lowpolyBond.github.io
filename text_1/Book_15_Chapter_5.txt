King Dhritarashtra, a strong king but getting old and a bit wobbly, went home.  He walked slowly, like a tired old elephant.  His wife, Gandhari, and his wise advisor, Vidura, walked with him.  Kripa, a great warrior, also followed.

At home, the king prayed, ate, and shared food with important guests.  Queen Gandhari and Queen Kunti, his wife, also ate after praying.

Then, the Pandava brothers came.  Dhritarashtra, Kunti's brother-in-law,  spoke to Yudhishthira, the oldest Pandava brother. He patted Yudhishthira on the back and said, "You're a good king, but ruling is hard work! I will give you some advice."

Dhritarashtra taught Yudhishthira how to be a good king:

* **Respect wise elders:** Listen to them and follow their advice.
* **Keep your promises:** Be true to your word.
* **Control your senses:** Be careful not to get carried away.
* **Choose good advisors:** Pick honest people who are loyal and clever.
* **Use spies:**  Secretly find out what your enemies are planning.
* **Protect your kingdom:** Build strong walls and gates.  Have many guards.
* **Protect yourself:** Be careful about what you eat, where you sleep, and who is around you.
* **Protect your family:** Keep your family safe and watched over by trusted people.
* **Choose wise ministers:** Pick kind, learned, and honest people to help you rule.
* **Hold secret meetings:** Don't let everyone know your plans.
* **Never share secrets:** Keep your plans private; secrets can be dangerous.
* **Know your people:** Find out what's good and bad in your kingdom.
* **Be fair:** Let your judges be honest and make good decisions. Check up on them!
* **Punish criminals:**  Punish people who break the law fairly and harshly.
* **Have a schedule:**  Spend time on important things like looking after money, your appearance, food, your army, and important visitors. Also set time aside for fun!
* **Fill your treasury:**  Get money honestly, not by cheating or stealing.
* **Get rid of enemies:** Secretly deal with dangerous enemies.
* **Choose good workers:** Pick hardworking and loyal people to work for you.  Make sure they do their jobs well.
* **Know your weaknesses:**  Figure out your mistakes and learn from them!  Check up on your enemyâ€™s mistakes as well.
* **Reward good workers:** Help your talented workers get better at their jobs.

Dhritarashtra told Yudhishthira, "By doing all this, you will be a truly great king!"
