Arjuna asked Krishna, "How did we win the battle, Krishna? How were all those strong warriors defeated?"

Krishna smiled. "Arjuna, those kings – Jarasandha, the king of the Chedis, and Ekalavya – were very powerful.  They were amazing warriors, almost as strong as gods! If they had joined Duryodhana, we would have lost!  They were all ready to fight for the Kauravas. They were enemies."

"Jarasandha was especially strong. He was made from two halves of a baby, put together by a powerful demon woman named Jara. Even the gods couldn't beat him easily!  Once, he threw a giant club that could have killed us all! But Krishna's brother, Balarama, threw his own weapon, and the club smashed into the ground, making the mountains shake!  After that, Bhima finally killed Jarasandha."

"Ekalavya was another great warrior. He was so good with a bow and arrow, he was unbeatable! But Drona, his teacher, tricked him and made him lose his thumb.  Without his thumb, he wasn't as strong, and I had to defeat him.  It was sad, but it was for the good of everyone."

"The king of the Chedis was also very strong, almost as strong as the gods. But I defeated him. We had to defeat them, Arjuna, to protect dharma (goodness).  Hidimba, Vaka, Kirmira, and even Ghatotkacha,  powerful demons, also had to be defeated to protect you and everyone else.  They were bad and hurt people."


"Even Karna was powerful, Arjuna. But I'll tell you how you can defeat him later.  Bhima will also defeat Duryodhana.  But for now, our army is in trouble! The Kauravas are winning and our soldiers are running away!"
