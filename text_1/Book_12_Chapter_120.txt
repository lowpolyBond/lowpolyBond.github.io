Once upon a time, in the land of Bharat, King Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandpa, you've told me about how kings ruled long ago.  But tell me again, in a way I can remember!"

Bhishma smiled. "A king's most important job is to protect everyone," he said. "Imagine a peacock with many beautiful feathers – a king must be many things! He should be brave, clever, honest, and kind. He needs to be like a chameleon, changing how he acts to get things done. Sometimes he must be quiet like a peacock in autumn, keeping his plans secret. He should speak softly and kindly. He must be handsome, know the holy books, and always watch for danger like someone fixing a leaky dam. He should listen to wise people for advice, like finding shelter near a big river."

"To be rich," Bhishma continued, "a king must be wise about collecting taxes, like carefully getting juice from a palm tree. He should be fair to his own people but strong against his enemies. He should crush his enemies' crops with his army, attack when his army is strong, and always look for his own weaknesses. He should tell everyone about his enemies’ bad deeds, and get rich by taking wealth from his enemies, just like picking flowers in the forest. He should attack like a clever hunter, sneaking up on his enemies.  He should go about his nightly activities quietly and privately like a peacock at night, enjoy his family, but always be ready to fight. He should be careful not to get caught in traps set by his enemies, and he should befriend his enemies' spies, only getting rid of them when safe to do so."


Bhishma explained, "A king should be like a peacock, doing what's best for himself and learning from everyone.  He should be smart and make his own decisions, but also ask others for advice.  Holy books help a king be wise. He should be friendly to his enemies, showing them how strong he is. He should always think carefully about what to do.  A truly wise king doesn't need much advice!"

"A king should use good people, strong and brave to help him rule. They should work together like the strings of a musical instrument making beautiful music. He should be good to everyone, but always fair.  A good king is like a strong mountain—everyone feels safe with him. He should be fair to everyone, even if he doesn't like them. He should hire only honest, wise people, and listen to his spies. A king who doesn't get angry or happy easily, and watches his money carefully, will become very rich. A good king publicly praises good people and punishes bad ones. He protects himself and his kingdom."

"Like the sun shining on everything, a king should watch over his kingdom, supervising his spies and helpers. He should collect taxes at the right time, but he shouldn't brag about it. He should collect taxes regularly, like a farmer milking his cow every day, or a bee collecting honey from flowers. He should save some money and spend the rest wisely. A wise king never wastes money or ignores even small problems or enemies. He should trust only clever people. A king should be strong, brave, smart, patient, and know when to act. Even a tiny spark can become a big fire.  Even a small seed can grow into a big tree. So a king must pay attention to everything, big and small."

"Even a small enemy can become powerful and destroy a careless king!  An enemy, strong or weak, can hurt a king’s reputation, stop him from doing good deeds, and take away his energy.  So a king must never ignore his enemies.  A smart king plans carefully before making war or peace. He needs a smart advisor to help him.  Intelligence can help even a weak king win. A patient king without bad habits can succeed even with a small army, but a king who only listens to flatterers will never win. So the king should be kind when collecting taxes and never overtax his people. If he is cruel, he will lose power quickly."

"Everything good comes from hard work, and hard work comes from being smart.  A smart person respects their body because it’s home to many powerful forces.  A greedy person is never happy, and they always want more. A greedy person has many faults, so a king should never hire one. Even a low person can help a king find information about his enemies. A good king learns from wise people, and has great advisors to help him. I have told you what the holy books say. A king who listens to his teachers and follows these rules will rule the whole world. A king who only relies on luck will not be happy and will not go to a good place after death.  A good king is ready for both war and peace, and he can beat even the strongest enemies. He finds clever ways to achieve his goals and doesn't just depend on fate.  He doesn’t blame good people for being bad. When two friends work together, praise the one who works harder. Follow these rules, my dear Yudhishthira, protect your people, and you will be rewarded with happiness in this life and the next!"
