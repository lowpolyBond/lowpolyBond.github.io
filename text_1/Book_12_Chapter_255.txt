Long ago, in the land of Bharatavarsha, a wise old warrior named Bhishma was talking to his grandson, Yudhishthira.  Bhishma told Yudhishthira a story a really smart teacher had told him about the world.

"Listen, my dear grandson," Bhishma said. "This teacher explained that everything is made of five basic things: earth, water, fire, air, and space."

Bhishma explained what makes each one special:

* **Earth:**  Earth is heavy, solid, and good for growing things. It smells, holds things together, and is patient.
* **Water:** Water is cool, wet, and flows easily. It tastes good, is soft, and can even become ice!
* **Fire:** Fire is hot, bright, and powerful. It burns, melts things, and always goes upwards.
* **Air:** Air is all around us. We breathe it, and it helps us talk. It moves things and gives us life.
* **Space:** Space is where everything exists.  It lets us hear sounds and has no end.


Bhishma also talked about our minds.  Our minds are also made up of lots of things:  things like remembering, thinking, dreaming, and feeling happy or sad.

Yudhishthira was very curious. "Grandfather," he asked, "that's all very interesting, but how does this all fit together?"

Bhishma smiled. "All these things – earth, water, fire, air, space, and our minds – are made by someone much bigger and more powerful than all of us.  They aren't eternal,  like the soul.  Learn about this great power, and you will find peace."

Bhishma told Yudhishthira that understanding these things would help him live a good life and find inner peace.
