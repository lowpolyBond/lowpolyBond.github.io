Once upon a time, King Yudhishthira asked his wise advisor, Bhishma, about the four ways people live their lives.  He wanted to know all about them.

Bhishma said, "Yudhishthira, you already know many things. But let me tell you how a good king can live a great life and earn lots of good karma."

Bhishma explained:  A good king is like someone who lives all four ways at once!

**1.  The Student (Brahmacharya):**  A king learns from wise teachers, studies holy books, and is always respectful. He prays every day.

**2.  The Householder (Garhasthya):** A good king is fair and kind. He helps people who deserve it, and punishes those who do wrong.  He's calm and wise. He always treats his family well.  He looks after everyone, like they were his own family.


**3. The Forest Dweller (Vanaprastha):** A king who protects his family and friends from trouble is like a forest dweller. He honors important people, and gives to those in need.  He fights to protect the good people in his kingdom.  He gives lots of gifts.


**4. The Renouncer (Sannyasa):**  A king who protects everyone, animals and people, and his kingdom is like a renouncer. He earns good karma for every creature he protects.  He's kind and doesn't hurt anyone.

Bhishma said, â€œA king who is kind to everyone, especially the young and old, earns good karma from all four ways of life. By protecting his people, a king gains even more good karma than a hermit living in the forest!  Being a good king is the best way to live a good life."

Bhishma told Yudhishthira to always be a good and fair king, to protect his people, and to be kind and just.  If he did this, he would earn all the good karma of all four ways of life!  And that's how a great king lives a truly great life.
