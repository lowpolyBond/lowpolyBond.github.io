Once upon a time, a very holy man named Uktha wanted a super-good son.  He prayed and prayed for many, many years!  He prayed with special songs and five special fires.

Then, BOOM! A bright, amazing being appeared!  This being had fiery red hair, sunny yellow arms, golden skin and eyes, and black feet.  Five other holy men helped Uktha, so the being had five different colors!

This amazing being was super strong and powerful.  He prayed for ten thousand years, too! Then he started making things!  He made day and night. He made Lord Shiva. He made the powerful god Indra. He even made wind and fire! He made so many things, including minds and our senses.

He also made five special sons.  Each son had a special father who had helped Uktha.  He made even more sons – fifteen more who were a bit mischievous!

These fifteen sons liked to mess with the gods’ special ceremonies. They would try to stop the offerings, or spoil the food for the gods.  But, if people were careful and gave them special prayers, they would be good and leave the ceremonies alone.

Uktha also had another son who lived on Earth, and people prayed to him, too. Uktha was so happy with all his amazing sons! He had created so much!
