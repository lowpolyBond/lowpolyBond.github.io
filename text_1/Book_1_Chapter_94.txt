Once upon a time, a king named Janamejaya wanted to hear stories about brave kings from a long, long time ago.  These kings were all related, like cousins and uncles and great-grandfathers!  They were all part of a big family called the Puru family.

A wise storyteller named Vaisampayana said, "Okay, I'll tell you about them! They were all super strong and clever."

The first king, Puru, had three sons: Pravira, Iswara, and Raudraswa.  They were all great warriors. Pravira was the most important, and he had a son named Manasyu. Manasyu was a powerful king who ruled the whole world!  He had three sons who were also brave warriors.

Another king, Kaudraswa, had ten sons!  These ten sons were amazing archers.  They were very good, and each had their own sons too.  One of them, Richeyu, also became a very famous king, even more powerful than Manasyu!  He had a son who performed special ceremonies and sacrifices, just like the kings in the old stories. This king had four sons, and one of them, Tansu, was a great conqueror! He ruled the entire world!

Tansu had a son named Ilina, who was also a powerful ruler. Ilina had five sons, the strongest of whom was Dushmanta.  Dushmanta married a woman named Sakuntala, and they had a son named Bharata.  Bharata became a very important king, and the whole family became known as the Bharata family because of him!

Bharata had many sons, but he didn't like them.  Unfortunately, their mothers got angry and something sad happened; they all died.  Bharata was very sad.  But then, with help from a wise man, he had another son named Bhumanyu.  Bhumanyu had many sons, and one of them, Suhotra, became a great king. Suhotra was so powerful that the earth almost sank under the weight of all the people, animals and things! He did many important ceremonies.

Suhotra had three sons, and the oldest, Ajamidha, became king. He had six sons, and one of them, Riksha, became king.  Sadly, under King Samvarana (Riksha's son), there were some hard times:  famine, sickness, and wars. The Bharata family had to hide in a forest for one thousand years!

Finally, a wise man helped them get their kingdom back!  Samvarana's son, Kuru, became king, and made a special place for ceremonies. He had five sons, and one of them had many strong sons too.

These kings had many, many sons and grandsons who were also strong and brave.  There were so many brave kings from the Puru family, all connected like branches of a huge, strong tree!  The storyteller continued telling stories of all their brave deeds and sacrifices for many hours.
