The Pandavas were ready for war!  Yudhishthira, with his brothers,  Krishna (Vasudeva), and many strong kings and warriors, had set up their camp on Kurukshetra.  They were like a powerful army, ready to fight.

Janamejaya wanted to know what Duryodhana did. He asked how the Kauravas prepared for battle.

Vaisampayana said,  "When Krishna left Duryodhana, Duryodhana was angry!  He called Karna, Dushasana, and Sakuni.  He said, ‘Krishna went to the Pandavas, and now they'll be even stronger!  Krishna wants a war! Bhimasena and Arjuna will fight hard.  Yudhishthira will listen to them. I’ve already treated Yudhishthira and his brothers badly. Now, even Virata and Drupada, who I fought against, are fighting *with* the Pandavas! This war will be huge!’"

Duryodhana told everyone to get ready for battle.  He ordered them to build a big camp with lots of space, water, and firewood.  He wanted to make sure they had everything they needed. The roads needed to be good for their army to travel.  He said the army should start moving the very next day.

Everyone agreed.  The next day, the Kauravas got ready! Kings and soldiers polished their armor.  They put on their best clothes and jewelry.  Warriors prepared their chariots and horses.  Elephant riders got their elephants ready.  Soldiers got their weapons and armor. The city of Hastinapura was filled with excited people. It looked like a big party, but everyone knew a terrible war was coming. The city looked like the ocean! The people were like the waves, the chariots and elephants like the fish, the noise like the ocean’s roar, and the treasures like jewels.  It was a very exciting, but scary, sight!
