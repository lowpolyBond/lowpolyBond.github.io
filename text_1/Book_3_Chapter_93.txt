Once upon a time, Yudhishthira, the eldest Pandava brother, planned a big trip to holy places called tirthas.  Some wise Brahmins (priests) lived with him in the forest. They asked Yudhishthira to take them along.

"King Yudhishthira," they said, "These tirthas are far away and very dangerous!  There are scary wild animals and bad people.  We're too small a group to go alone. But with you and your brave brothers, we'll be safe! Please, take us with you so we can be blessed."

Yudhishthira was a kind king.  He looked at his strong brothers, Bhima and the twins, Nakula and Sahadeva.  He smiled and said, "Of course, you can come!"

Just then, some important guests arrived:  Vyasa, Narada, and Parvata, very wise and holy men.  Yudhishthira greeted them politely. They told the Pandavas, "Before you go, make your hearts pure and kind.  It's not just about washing your bodies; you must also clean your minds of bad thoughts. That's the real way to be blessed by the tirthas."

The Pandavas agreed. They asked their holy teachers and guests to bless them.  After a special ceremony, the Pandavas were ready for their great journey!  They wore simple clothes and carried many weapons.  They took along their friend Krishna, their priest Dhaumya, and the Brahmins from the forest. With their servants and many chariots, they set off one day after the full moon, heading east towards the holy tirthas.  They were excited for their adventure!
