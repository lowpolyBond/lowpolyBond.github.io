King Yudhishthira, a very good and humble king, asked Bhishma, a wise prince, about giving away cows.  He loved hearing Bhishma’s stories!

Yudhishthira said, "Tell me more about giving cows, Bhishma! I can't get enough of your wise words!"

Bhishma happily agreed.  He said, "Giving a young, healthy, gentle cow, nicely dressed, to a holy man washes away your sins.  But giving a sick, old, or weak cow – a cow that can't even eat or drink – is very bad. It’s like giving someone empty promises.  You’ll go to a dark, scary place if you do that!  Don't give a grumpy or mean cow either, or a cow you haven't paid for properly. Only give strong, happy, and healthy cows. The best cow is a Kapila cow. It’s like the best river, the Ganga!"

Yudhishthira asked, "Why is the Kapila cow the best, Grandfather? Aren't all good cows the same?"

Bhishma explained, "Long ago, Daksha, a great creator, made all living things. He made food first, then animals.  The animals were hungry, so Daksha drank some magical nectar. He burped, and *poof*!  A wonderful cow named Surabhi appeared! Surabhi had many daughters, all golden-colored Kapila cows.  They gave milk to everyone.

Some of the milk splashed onto Lord Shiva. He got angry and looked at the cows with his special eye. This changed some of their colors, but the cows who hid from him stayed golden. Daksha, the cow's dad, told Shiva that the cows' milk was always pure, even if calves drank it first.  The cows would feed everyone in the world!

Shiva, still a little grumpy, became the protector of the cows. That's why the Kapila cows, who stayed golden, are so special.  They give lots of milk, and giving one is like giving many wonderful gifts!"

Yudhishthira, after hearing this story, and wanting to be good and happy, gave many cows and bulls of all colors to holy men. He wanted to go to a good place after he died and become very famous. He gave away thousands and thousands of cows!
