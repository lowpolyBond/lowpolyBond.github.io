Once upon a time, a very smart boy named Ashtavakra went to a big party at King Janaka's palace.  Lots of important people were there! Ashtavakra wanted to find another smart guy named Vandin, who thought he was the best arguer ever.

Ashtavakra said, "Vandin, you think you're so smart! Let's have a contest!  I'm like a roaring fire, and you're like a tiny spark.  Don't even try to fight me!"

Then, Ashtavakra and Vandin started a clever word game.  They took turns saying things about numbers.

Ashtavakra said, "One sun shines on the whole world!"

Vandin said, "Three Vedas are used for special prayers!"

Ashtavakra said, "Four legs has a cow!"

They went on like this, with 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, even 13! Vandin couldn't think of anything else to say.  Ashtavakra finished his turn. Everyone was amazed at how smart Ashtavakra was!

Ashtavakra was angry because Vandin used to be mean to other smart people, making them fall in the water.  Ashtavakra told everyone to throw Vandin in the water too.

But Vandin said, "Wait! I'm the son of King Varuna, the water god!  And my father is having a big party too, and the other smart people are already there!"  Then, magically, all the other smart people arrived!

It turned out that Ashtavakra's father was also there. They hadn't seen each other for a long time!   Everyone was happy.

After the celebration, Vandin went into the sea.  Ashtavakra saw his dad and they hugged. Ashtavakra then jumped into a special river.  When he came out, all his crooked body was straight!  The river was named Samanga, and anyone who bathed in it was said to be cleansed of their bad deeds.

The king and everyone were very happy.  Ashtavakra went home with his father and uncle. The end!
