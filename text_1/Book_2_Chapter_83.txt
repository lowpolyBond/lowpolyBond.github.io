Prince Bharata woke up early. He wanted to see his brother, Rama.  He climbed into his shiny chariot.  It looked like the sun!

Many people went with him.  There were horses, elephants, and carts full of soldiers.  His mom, aunts, and many other people rode in fancy chariots too. Everyone was talking about Rama. They couldn't wait to see him! They said Rama was strong and brave, and seeing him would make them happy.

All sorts of people joined the trip. There were shopkeepers, artists, musicians, and even cowherds!  Everyone wanted to meet Rama. They all dressed up in their best clothes.

They traveled a long way.  They finally reached a big river, the Ganges.  Bharata stopped his army there.  He wanted to pray for his father, the king, who had died.  Bharata was sad, but he was hoping to bring Rama home.  He spent the night thinking about how to do it.
