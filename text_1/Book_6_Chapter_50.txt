After the first day of battle, Duryodhana was happy.  His warrior, Bhishma, was strong and angry!  Yudhishthira was sad.  His army was losing badly. Bhishma was like a fire, burning up Yudhishthira's soldiers!

Yudhishthira went to Krishna, his friend.  "Krishna," he said, "Bhishma is too powerful! He's like a giant, unstoppable! My soldiers are running away.  I don't want my brothers to die fighting him. I want to give up."  Yudhishthira was ready to quit the war and go live in the forest.

Krishna said, "Don't worry! You have brave warriors on your side.  There's Satyaki, Virata, and Drupada, and even Dhrishtadyumna, who can defeat Bhishma!"

Yudhishthira then asked Dhrishtadyumna, his army leader, to fight Bhishma.  Dhrishtadyumna agreed. He was brave and ready to fight Bhishma, Drona, Kripa, and all the other Kaurava warriors!

Yudhishthira told Dhrishtadyumna to make a special battle formation, a really strong one, that no one had ever seen before.  They named it the Krauncharuma.

Dhrishtadyumna put Arjuna, the best warrior, at the front.  Arjuna's flag looked beautiful, shining brightly in the sky! Drupada led the main part of the army, and other kings and soldiers took their places.  They had elephants and chariots, lots and lots of soldiers!  It was a huge army ready for battle!

The Pandavas, all dressed in shiny armor, waited for the sun to rise. Their beautiful white umbrellas shone, as bright as the sun!  They were ready to fight, ready to win!
