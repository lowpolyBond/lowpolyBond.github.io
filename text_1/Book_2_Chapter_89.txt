Bharata woke up where Rama had slept.  "Brother Shatrughna!" he called, "Wake up!  Let's get Guha, the Nishada leader, to help us cross the river!"

Shatrughna said, "I'm already awake! I couldn't sleep, I was thinking about Rama too!"

Just then, Guha arrived.  "Did you sleep well?" he asked kindly. "Was everything alright?"

Bharata said, "Thank you, Guha! We slept peacefully.  Please help us cross the river with your boats."

Guha rushed back to his town.  "Everyone, wake up!" he shouted. "Get the boats ready! We'll take the army across the river!"

His people got many boats – five hundred!  They even had a special, beautiful boat called the "Svastika" with bells and flags.  Bharata, Shatrughna, the queens, and everyone else got on the boats.  There were boats for people, boats for horses, even boats for cows and elephants!

It was busy!  Some people bathed in the river, others packed up their things.  The boats sailed across the river, whoosh!

Once they reached the other side, the ferrymen played in the water.  The elephants were amazing – some walked across, some went in boats, and some even swam!

After crossing the river, they arrived at Prayaga.  Bharata told his army to rest.  Then, with his teacher Vasishtha, he went to visit a wise old man named Bharadvaja.  They found his home in the forest – cute little huts made of leaves!
