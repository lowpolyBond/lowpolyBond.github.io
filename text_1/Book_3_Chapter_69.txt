Once upon a time, in a faraway land, lived a beautiful princess named Damayanti.  She was the daughter of King Bhima, a very good and kind ruler.  Damayanti was married to King Nala, a wise and just king from another land.

One day, Nala lost a game of dice to his brother. He lost everything – his kingdom, his riches, and even his home!  He and Damayanti secretly ran away.

A long time passed. Damayanti’s family didn’t know where she was. They searched everywhere.  Finally, they found her! She was living with a kind family, far from home.  They knew it was her because of a special birthmark – a tiny, dark spot between her eyebrows, shaped like a lotus flower. It was hard to see because it was covered in dust.

When Damayanti's aunt saw the birthmark, she cried and hugged her.  Damayanti was very happy to see her family again. But she missed her husband, Nala, terribly.

Damayanti told her aunt, "I want to go home, but I miss my husband. Please help me find him."

Her aunt agreed to help.  She sent messengers to find Nala. Damayanti told the messengers what to say: "Tell everyone about Nala’s kindness and how he left her, alone and sad.  Ask if anyone has seen him.  Find him, no matter where he is!"

The messengers traveled far and wide, shouting Damayanti’s message in every town and village, every forest and mountain.  They searched high and low, hoping to find the lost king.  This was their important mission. They searched for Nala everywhere, and they kept looking until they found him.
