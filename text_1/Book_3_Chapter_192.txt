Once upon a time, in a land filled with magic and mighty heroes, some wise people asked Markandeya, a very old and knowledgeable man, a question. They wanted to know why Rishi Vaka, a holy man, lived for so incredibly long.

Markandeya simply said, "Rishi Vaka is a very holy man. He's lived a long life, and that’s that!"

But Yudhishthira, a wise and just king, and his brothers weren't satisfied. They had heard that Rishi Vaka and another holy man, Dalvya, were almost immortal and were friends with Indra, the king of the gods.  They begged Markandeya to tell them the story of Vaka and Indra's meeting.

Markandeya agreed.  He said, "After a great battle between the gods and the demons, Indra became king of the whole world!  The land was happy and peaceful.  Everyone was kind and did good things. Indra, very happy to see his people thriving, rode his elephant Airavata and traveled around his kingdom. He visited holy places, beautiful rivers, and prosperous towns.  Then he came to a special place by the sea, a peaceful home for many animals and birds.  There, he saw Rishi Vaka."

Vaka was so happy to see the great Indra! He welcomed him, offering him water to wash his feet, a comfortable place to sit, and delicious fruits and roots.  Indra, comfortable and relaxed, asked Vaka, "You've lived for a hundred years!  Tell me, what are the saddest things about living so long?"

Vaka replied, "Even for someone who lives a long time, the worst things are: being around unkind people, missing the people you love, and having bad friends.  Seeing your family and friends die is also very painful.  And it's sad to need other people's help.  It's also very sad to see poor people treated badly by rich people.  It's painful to see families lose their honor or gain it unexpectedly.  And it's heartbreaking to see good people suffer and bad people be happy.  There is so much sadness in the world!"

Indra then said, "Tell me, what are the happiest things about living a long life?"

Vaka smiled. "The happiest thing is to cook a simple meal in your own home, without needing to depend on anyone.  It doesn't matter if it's just vegetables.  Eating food you earned yourself, even if it's just fruit, is better than eating fancy food someone else gave you because they felt sorry for you.  The best food is the food a good person eats after feeding their guests and family, and giving offerings to their ancestors. It’s very good for the soul!  Every bite brings great happiness and washes away past mistakes.”

After talking for a long time, Indra went back to heaven, his heart full of the wisdom Rishi Vaka shared.
