Once upon a time, in a great battle, there was a warrior named Drona. He was very strong and brave.  He fought like a wildfire, burning through the enemy's soldiers.  His bow twanged like thunder, and his arrows flew fast and furious.  He crashed through the enemy lines like a storm, making everyone afraid.  The battlefield became a terrible river of blood, filled with dead soldiers and broken chariots. It was a scary, messy place!

While Drona was causing havoc, the Pandavas, led by Yudhishthira, attacked him.  A huge battle began!  Sakuni, a sneaky warrior, attacked Sahadeva, but Sahadeva fought back bravely and even defeated Sauvala.  Then Sahadeva and Sauvala's son fought a close-up battle with clubs after their chariots were destroyed.

Many other warriors fought bravely, too!  Bhima fought Vivinsati, and they both showed amazing skill. Nakula fought his uncle, Salya, and Dhrishtaketu fought Kripa. Satyaki and Kritavarman also fought a great battle; neither one would give up!  King Virata and his soldiers fought bravely, too. King Drupada fought Bhagadatta in a very exciting battle.  Sikhandin fought Somadatta’s son, and they were both incredibly skilled. Hidimba's son and Alamvusha, who were magical warriors, fought each other with magical tricks.

Abhimanyu, a young but very strong warrior, fought Paurava.  Abhimanyu was so good that he even disarmed Paurava!  Then Jayadratha, another enemy warrior, jumped in to fight Abhimanyu.  They fought with swords, and Abhimanyu was so strong he broke Jayadratha's sword!

After the sword fight, many more warriors surrounded Abhimanyu.  He fought them all, bravely using his sword and shield. Salya then threw a huge, fiery spear at Abhimanyu.  Abhimanyu caught it! He then threw it back, killing Salya’s charioteer. Everyone cheered for Abhimanyu, but the enemy warriors were angry and attacked him all at once.  They showered him with arrows, surrounding him like a dark cloud.  Salya, wanting to help his side, joined the attack.
