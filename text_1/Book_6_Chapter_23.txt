Once upon a time, before a big battle, Arjuna, a brave warrior, felt scared.  His friend Krishna, very wise and kind, told him to pray to the powerful goddess Durga.

Arjuna got down from his chariot and, with his hands together, prayed to Durga. He called her by many names:  the forest dweller, the black and tawny one, the wife of the destroyer, the winner of battles! He praised her strength and beauty. He thanked her for protecting her followers and defeating bad people.  He called her by many names, like Mahakali and Uma.  He talked about her power and her kindness. He even mentioned how she had eaten bad people who looked like wolves! He told her how she was like everything good – the Vedas, the sun, the moon, even sleep!


Arjuna’s prayer was long and full of praise for the great Goddess. He asked her for help in the battle.

Because Arjuna was so sincere, Durga appeared!  She told Arjuna, "Don't worry, you will win! You have Narayana (God) on your side!"  Then she disappeared.

Arjuna felt much braver. He got back in his chariot, and he and Krishna blew their special horns.

Sanjaya, who was telling this story, said that if anyone prays to Durga like Arjuna did, they will be safe from bad things! They will be brave, win all their battles, and live a long and happy life!  Even kings will fear them!

Sanjaya also said that the bad guys in the battle didn't understand how powerful God (Narayana) and Krishna were, and that's why they were going to lose.  He reminded everyone that goodness always wins!  Being good and kind brings happiness and victory.
