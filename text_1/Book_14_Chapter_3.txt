Once upon a time, after a big, sad war, King Yudhishthira felt very guilty.  He’d lost many friends and family.  A wise old man named Vyasa told him, “Yudhishthira, you shouldn’t blame yourself too much.  Good and bad things happen, but you can make things better.”

Vyasa explained that doing good things, like giving gifts and helping others, could wash away bad feelings.  He said, “Great kings often held big ceremonies called sacrifices to become strong and good.  You should do a special sacrifice called the Rajasuya.”

Yudhishthira said, “But Vyasa, I have no money! The war left us with nothing. How can I give gifts when everyone is poor and hurt?”

Vyasa thought for a moment. Then he smiled. “Don’t worry, Yudhishthira! There’s lots of gold hidden in the Himalayan mountains.  A long, long time ago, King Marutta had a huge sacrifice, and the Brahmins (holy men) left a lot of gold behind!”

Yudhishthira was curious. “King Marutta?  Tell me about him!” he asked.

Vyasa said, “That’s a story for another time, my dear King.  But know this, the gold is there.  It will help you perform your sacrifice and make things right.”

And so, Yudhishthira learned that even after terrible things happen, there's always a way to do good and feel better.  He knew he had a long road ahead of him, but with help from Vyasa, he was ready to start.
