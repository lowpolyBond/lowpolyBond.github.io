Once upon a time, a wise man named Yajnavalkya told a king a very interesting story about time.  He said, "Imagine a giant, super-powerful being!  One of his days is like 10,000 kalpas long!  A kalpa is a super-long time, like, really, really long!  And his night is just as long."

When the giant woke up, he made all the plants and trees.  These were food for all the animals and people. Then, he made a special being called Brahman. Brahman came from a golden egg! Brahman was like the shape of everything in the world. He lived in the egg for a whole year, then popped out and made the whole Earth and the sky!  He even put space between them.

Brahman's day was 7,500 kalpas long, and his night was the same.  Then, Brahman made another being, who made even more beings! These beings had four sons, and the sons were the ancestors of everyone!

Then, this being made five important things: earth, wind, fire, water, and sky. He also made five senses: seeing, hearing, touching, tasting, and smelling.  These senses made animals and people want to play together, fight, and even hurt each other.

The day of this being lasted 5,000 kalpas, and so did his night!  Even shorter days and nights belonged to other beings. Each day lasted 3,000 kalpas.

Yajnavalkya explained that our minds are the most important.  Our eyes can only see if our minds are working. Itâ€™s our mind that lets us see, hear, taste, smell, and touch!  Without our minds, our senses don't work. The wise man said there are twenty important things that make up the whole world. And that, my friend, is a very long story about time!
