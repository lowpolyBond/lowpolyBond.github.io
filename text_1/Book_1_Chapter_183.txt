Long ago, in a land filled with magic, lived a powerful wise man named Parasara.  His father, Saktri, had been killed a long time ago.  Parasara was very sad and angry.

He decided to perform a special magical ceremony, a sacrifice, to get revenge.  This sacrifice was meant to destroy evil creatures called Rakshasas.  Parasara was so strong and powerful that he was like a blazing fire himself! He started to destroy many Rakshasas, big and small.

Other wise men, like Pulastya, Atri, and Kratu, saw what was happening. They were worried. Pulastya gently explained to Parasara, "Parasara, my child, these Rakshasas didn't kill your father. Your father's death was his own fault. He had made a mistake a long time ago."

Pulastya told him that Saktri and the other people who died had gone to a happy place in the sky.  He explained that Parasara's actions were wrong, and that hurting innocent creatures wasn't right.

Parasara listened to the wise words.  He felt sad that he had been so angry. He understood that he shouldn't have hurt the Rakshasas.

He stopped his magical ceremony right then.  He put out the magical fire, throwing it into the faraway woods.  Even today, some people say that fire still burns there, sometimes consuming trees and stones. Parasara learned that even great power needs to be used wisely and with kindness.
