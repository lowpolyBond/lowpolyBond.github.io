King Dasharatha died!  Prince Bharata was very, very sad.  A wise man named Vasishtha came to help.  "Bharata," he said kindly, "you must be brave.  It's time to give your father a proper goodbye."

Bharata, who was lying on the ground, got up.  He helped prepare his father's body. Even though the king had been in oil for days, he looked like he was just asleep. They put him on a beautiful bed.

Bharata cried, "Father! Why did you send Rama away?  Now Rama's gone, and you're gone!  Our kingdom feels empty and sad without you. It's like a dark night without a moon!"

Vasishtha said again, "Bharata, we must do the funeral ceremony now."

So Bharata, with the help of priests, started the ceremony.  They carried the king's body on a special bed.  They threw flowers and coins as they went.  The air smelled of sweet incense and sandalwood.

They took the king to the Sarayu River.  They built a big fire with special wood. They put the king on the fire.  The priests chanted special prayers.  They wanted the king to go to a happy place.

The king's wives came, riding in their palanquins. They cried and cried. Their sadness was like the sad cries of birds.  After the fire burned down, everyone went to the river. They poured water and said goodbye. Then they went back to the city, and for ten days, they slept on the hard ground, still so sad.
