Once upon a time, the Pandavas, five brothers, were in hiding in the scary Kamyaka forest.  It was nighttime, and scary monsters called Rakshasas came out then.

One night, a huge, scary Rakshasa with flaming eyes blocked their path. He was super strong and looked like a giant cloud with lightning!  He roared so loud that animals ran away in fear.  Even Draupadi, the Pandavas' sister-in-law, was very scared.

A wise man, Dhaumya, helped by using magic words to get rid of the Rakshasa's tricks.  Then the Rakshasa, whose name was Kirmira, showed his true form. He was angry!

Kirmira said he wanted to get revenge on Bhima, the strongest Pandava.  He blamed Bhima for killing his brother and a friend! He said he would eat Bhima!

King Yudhishthira, the oldest brother, tried to talk to Kirmira, but Kirmira wouldn't listen.  Bhima, strong and brave, quickly grabbed a big tree branch and got ready to fight.

Kirmira also fought back with trees and rocks! Their fight was amazing and noisy, like two angry elephants battling.  Bhima was super strong. He wrestled with Kirmira, spun him around, and finally threw him down!  He then hugged Kirmira very tightly until he couldn't move, and then Bhima defeated him.

After Bhima killed the scary Rakshasa, everyone was relieved.  The Pandavas continued their journey, safe and happy.  King Dhritarashtra, who heard the story, was both amazed and sad.
