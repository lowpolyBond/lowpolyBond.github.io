Once upon a time, during a great battle, Abhimanyu, a brave young warrior, was fighting very well. He was winning!  He defeated many soldiers on the other side.

Duryodhana, the king of the other army, was very angry. He was losing! He turned to fight Abhimanyu himself.

Drona, a powerful warrior, saw this.  "Save the king!" he shouted to his soldiers. "Abhimanyu is too strong!  Attack him together!"

Many strong warriors surrounded Abhimanyu. They shot many arrows at him.  But Abhimanyu was incredibly brave and skilled. He fought back, shooting arrows like a storm! He roared like a lion!

More and more warriors joined the fight.  They threw arrows, but Abhimanyu kept fighting.  He was like a strong wall, stopping the enemy's attack.

Duhsaha hit Abhimanyu with nine arrows! Duhsasana hit him with twelve!  Many other warriors also shot arrows at him.  But Abhimanyu, never giving up, fought back bravely, hitting them all with his arrows.


Then Abhimanyu got even angrier.  He was so strong and fast! He easily defeated a powerful warrior, the king of Asmaka.  He cut off the king's chariot, arms, bow, and even his head!

But then, even more warriors attacked Abhimanyu all at once. Karna, Kripa, and many other great fighters, showered him with arrows.  Abhimanyu fought bravely, even hitting Karna, making him hurt badly!

Abhimanyu hit many more warriors but was hit by so many arrows himself.  He kept fighting until he hit Salya, another powerful warrior, making him fall from his chariot!

Seeing Salya fall, the enemy army was scared and ran away. Abhimanyu, even though covered in arrows, had fought bravely and won! Even though he was hurt, he was a true hero.
