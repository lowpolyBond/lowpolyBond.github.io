Once upon a time, a prince named Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, a big question: "Grandpa, which is better – living a simple life focused on helping others, or doing special religious practices?"

Bhishma smiled. "Both are wonderful, my boy," he said. "Both are very hard to do perfectly, but both bring great rewards."  He told Yudhishthira a story to help him understand.

Long ago, King Nahusha was about to kill a cow to be polite to a guest.  But a very good man named Kapila saw this. Kapila was kind, peaceful, and always tried to avoid hurting anyone. He cried out, "Oh, Vedas! Are you right to say it’s okay to kill animals?"

Suddenly, a wise man named Syumarasmi magically became the cow! He spoke to Kapila, "Kapila, the Vedas are like the words of God!  They're very old and very important.  People who are very smart and follow the Vedas say they are God's words, and we should trust them."

Kapila answered, "I'm not against the Vedas. But many different ways to live can help us be good.  Whether you live simply, do religious practices, or are part of a family – they all can lead to happiness."

Syumarasmi explained, "The Vedas say we should do sacrifices, like special ceremonies, to get good things. We use animals and plants in these ceremonies. The Vedas also say animals and plants are what makes these ceremonies work.  They teach that the whole world is for sacrifices. Many important people did sacrifices in the past."

Syumarasmi continued, "Even though animals are used, the people who do sacrifices only for the good of doing them, and not for themselves,  don't hurt anyone.  It’s like a big puzzle, all the parts work together. Even the cow gives everything needed for the ceremony."

Syumarasmi said, "The Vedas say some things about doing things, and some things about not doing things.  Both are important. If you don't do sacrifices, you might not have a good life now or later."

Bhishma concluded the story. "So, Yudhishthira," he said, "both ways of living are good.  It's important to be kind and to follow your heart."
