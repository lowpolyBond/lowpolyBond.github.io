Once upon a time, Narada, a wise man, was doing special prayers. He was praying to the gods and then to his ancestors, called the Pitris.  Nara and Narayana, two powerful brothers, saw him.

"Narada," they asked, "Who are you praying to? And why?"

Narada explained, "I’m following your teachings.  You said praying to the gods is like praying to Vishnu, the great god who is always there.  Vishnu is the source of everything. Even Brahma, the creator god, came from Vishnu.  Brahma is my father's father. I’m now praying to the Pitris because of Vishnu.  He's everyone's father, mother, and grandfather!"

Narada then told a strange story.  "Long ago," he said, "the gods forgot some important prayers. Their sons had to teach them again! So, the sons became like fathers, and the fathers became like sons. They even worshipped each other! They used three little balls of earth on grass to do this."

Narada wanted to know why these little earth balls were connected to the ancestors.

Nara and Narayana said, "A long time ago, the earth sank!  Vishnu, as a giant boar, lifted it back up.  Mud was all over him. When it was time for prayers, he shook three balls of mud off his tusk and put them on some grass. These were offerings to himself. He said, 'These balls of mud will be known as the Pitris, the ancestors.  I am their father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. I am in these balls.'"

Vishnu put the mud balls on the Varaha mountains and worshipped himself.  Then he disappeared. That's why the ancestors are called Pindas (which means "balls").

Nara and Narayana added, "When you pray to your ancestors, to the gods, to good people, to animals, or even the earth, you are actually worshipping Vishnu. He is in everything!"
