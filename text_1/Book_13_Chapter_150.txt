King Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather Bhishma, "Grandpa, what are some special words I can say every day to be a good person?  What magic words can I say before a trip, starting a new house, or doing something important?  What words keep me safe, help me win, and make me happy, but are still good words from our holy books?"

Bhishma smiled. "My dear King," he said, "listen carefully!  I'll tell you about some very special words, taught by the great Vyasa and blessed by the sun god Savitri.  These words wash away all your bad deeds!  Just listening to me will make you a better person. If you say them every day and night, you’ll always be good.

These words are amazing! They bring good luck, make your wishes come true, and bring you happiness now and forever. Even great kings said these words every day to be good and successful.

These words mention many important gods and people:  The great snake Ananta, the powerful god Rudra (with many names!), the sun gods (Adityas), the Vasus, the Ashwins, and many other powerful beings who watch over us.  They also mention many wise men (Rishis), like Vasishtha, Parasara, and Kanva.  They also mention powerful kings like Prithu and Bhagiratha.  Saying their names is a very good thing to do.

By saying all these names, you'll become good and lucky. You'll have lots of good things! You’ll get to a happy place after you die!

If you say these words, you'll be protected from danger, your crops will grow well, and your enemies will lose.  You’ll even be safe on journeys!  If you are sick, these words can make you better.  If you say them at home, your family will be safe.

These words are like magic for good things. Even the wise men and gods who made the world use these words to stay strong and good. They are holy and very powerful. You should say these words every morning and evening, with good thoughts in your heart.

These words bring luck, protection, health, and happiness. They chase away bad dreams and bad luck. Saying these words keeps away the bad things and makes your life better in many ways.  This is the best advice, given even to the gods long ago."
