King Dhritarashtra was teaching his nephew, Yudhishthira, how to be a good king.  He said, "Yudhishthira, you need to know who your friends and enemies are.  Some are your allies, some are neutral, and some are friends of your enemies!

Think about your kingdom's strength.  Consider your ministers, your soldiers, your forts, and the people who live in your land.  Your enemies might try to weaken you by attacking any of these.  A wise king protects them all.

There are twelve important things a king must watch carefully.  These things are like parts of a puzzle.  A king must know when to make peace, when to go to war, when to move his army, and when to stay still.  He needs to know if his kingdom is growing stronger or weaker.

If your army is strong and your enemies are weak, then it's time to fight and win!  But if you're weak and your enemies are strong, try to make peace. Always keep plenty of food and supplies.  When you're ready to fight, act quickly and put the right people in charge.

If you have to give land to the enemy, give them poor land.  If you have to give money, give them coins that aren't worth much.  If you must give soldiers, give your weakest ones.  When you *take* land, money, or soldiers from your enemies, take the best!  To make sure peace lasts, ask for the enemy's son as a hostage.

Always take care of the poor and sick people in your kingdom.  Fight your enemies using all your strength, but don't hurt the smaller kings who are loyal to you.  Never try to fight a king who wants to rule the whole world! Instead, try to get his advisors and friends to turn against him.  Even weak kings are important because they protect good people and punish bad ones.

Be like a strong cane:  bend but don’t break. If a strong king attacks you, try to make peace.  If that doesn’t work, fight!  Use everything you have – your soldiers, your money, and your people.  If you must lose, lose everything except your honor. Even if you die fighting, you will be free from sorrow."
