Once upon a time, there were two groups of cousins: the Pandavas and the Kurus.  The Pandavas were five brothers, and the Kurus were led by the jealous Duryodhana.

After their father died, the Pandavas grew up strong and skilled with bows and arrows.  Duryodhana, who was mean and greedy, was very jealous of their popularity. He and his friends tried to hurt the Pandavas many times.  They even tried to poison Bhima, but Bhima was super strong and didn't get sick! They tried to drown him in the river, but he escaped! They even sent poisonous snakes to bite him, but he survived!  Vidura, a wise man, secretly helped the Pandavas stay safe.

Duryodhana couldnâ€™t defeat the Pandavas fairly, so he tricked them. He built a house made of wax and invited the Pandavas to live there.  While they were sleeping, Duryodhana planned to burn the house down! But Vidura had helped the Pandavas build a secret tunnel, and they escaped the fire!

The Pandavas ran away into the forest.  Bhima even married a Rakshasa (a kind of monster) woman! They lived in the forest for a while, and Bhima fought and defeated many scary monsters.  Then, they went to a big party to find a wife.  They all married the beautiful Draupadi!

After a while, the Pandavas were given some land called Khandavaprastha. They built a strong kingdom and ruled it wisely.  Arjuna, one of the Pandava brothers, even went on an adventure and married a princess! He helped a powerful fire god, and as a reward, got a magical bow and arrow!  A clever monster also built them a beautiful palace.

But Duryodhana was still jealous! He tricked Yudhishthira, the oldest Pandava brother, into a game of dice.  Duryodhana cheated and won, forcing the Pandavas to go into exile for thirteen years.  After that, when they returned to get their kingdom back, Duryodhana refused to give it to them.

This led to a big war.  The Pandavas fought bravely and won!  They defeated Duryodhana and all his friends, and finally got their kingdom back.  That's the story of how the good Pandavas won against the mean Kurus!
