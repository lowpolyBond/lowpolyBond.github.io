Once upon a time, in a faraway land, two sisters saw a beautiful horse.  This wasn't just any horse!  It was Uchchaihsravas, a magical horse, so shiny and strong.  He was so amazing, the gods themselves worshipped him!

Someone asked, "Where did this amazing horse come from?"

Well, it all started with a big mountain called Meru.  It was so tall and shiny, it looked like it touched the sky! Gods and magical beings lived there.  The gods really wanted something special called Amrita, a magical drink that made them live forever.

So, the gods and some other powerful beings decided to churn the ocean!  Imagine, stirring the whole ocean like a giant pot of soup!  They used a giant snake as a rope, and a mountain as a churner! It was hard work!

While they were churning, lots of amazing things came outâ€”gems, jewels, and even this wonderful horse, Uchchaihsravas!  That's how this amazing horse appeared, all thanks to the gods' hard work churning the ocean!  The gods got their Amrita too.  And that's the story of the magical horse!
