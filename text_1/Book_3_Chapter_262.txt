Once upon a time, the Pandava brothers – five amazing princes – lived in a big, beautiful forest called Kamyaka.  They were strong and brave, like gods! They spent their days hunting and exploring.

One day, the brothers went hunting to get food for their wise friends, the Brahmins. They left their beautiful wife, Draupadi, alone at their home in the forest.  Draupadi was very pretty.

Now, a king named Jayadratha was traveling. He was looking for a bride.  He stopped in the Kamyaka forest.  And guess what? He saw Draupadi!

Draupadi was so beautiful that Jayadratha and his friends were amazed. They whispered, "Is she a fairy? An angel?"  Jayadratha was so captivated, he wanted her to be his wife!

He was greedy and selfish. He said to his friend Kotika, "Who is this wonderful woman?  I don't need another wife, I want *her*! I'll take her back to my kingdom. Then, I'll find out who she is."

Jayadratha wanted Draupadi so badly that he sent Kotika to ask Draupadi who she was and if she was married. Kotika, a little nervous, approached Draupadi like a shy jackal approaching a fierce tiger.  He was ready to find out more about this stunning woman!
