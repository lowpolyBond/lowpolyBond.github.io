Garuda the eagle told a story about the South.  Long ago, a powerful god named Vivaswat gave this land as a gift, so it's called Dakshina, which means "south."  This is where the spirits of our ancestors live!  There are also special sky-people who eat only smoke, and other amazing beings.

Many important people live in the South.  Wise saints and holy kings live there happily.  Good deeds are rewarded there, and bad deeds get their consequences.  Everyone goes to the South after they die.  It's a little dark and spooky, though, because it's hard to see.  There are also some scary monsters called Rakshasas.  Sometimes beautiful music from Gandharvas makes people forget everything. Even a king once ran away from his kingdom to hear their music!

The sun goes only so far south, like it has a stop sign!  A powerful demon named Ravana tried to get magic powers there. Another demon, Vritra, got in trouble there, too.  The South is where everything breaks down into tiny pieces after we die. Bad people suffer here, too. There's even a river filled with people who did bad things!  The South is where you find great joy or great sadness.  The sun shines differently there; it's special.

Garuda even saw a giant elephant fighting a giant turtle! A very powerful wise man was even born there.  He was so smart, he helped some people who were in trouble.  There are also amazing cities ruled by giant snakes and other magical creatures.  It is very, very dark there. Even the sun can't shine through!  You have to go through the South when you die, but itâ€™s a difficult journey.

So, do you want to hear about the South, or should I tell you about the West instead?
