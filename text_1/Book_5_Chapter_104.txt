Once upon a time, there was a wonderful charioteer named Matali. He was Indra's best friend and driver! Matali was super strong and brave.  He drove Indra's amazing chariot, pulled by a thousand horses!  He was so good at his job that the gods always won their battles against the bad guys, the Asuras.  Matali had a beautiful daughter named Gunakesi.  She was kind and talented.  Matali wanted to find a good husband for her.

A wise man named Narada told a king of the snakes, Aryaka, that Matali wanted Aryaka's grandson, Sumukha, to marry Gunakesi.  Aryaka was happy, but also sad. Sumukha's father had died, and a powerful bird, Garuda, had said he would eat Sumukha too!

Matali had a plan! He, Narada, and Aryaka took Sumukha to see Indra, the king of the gods, and Vishnu, another powerful god.  Narada told them everything. Vishnu asked Indra to make Sumukha immortal, like the gods.  Indra was worried about Garuda, so he asked Vishnu to do it. Vishnu gave Sumukha a gift of long life.  

Sumukha was very happy! He married Gunakesi, and everyone celebrated.  Aryaka and Narada were so relieved and joyful. They thanked Indra and Vishnu for their kindness.  Sumukha lived a long and happy life with his beautiful wife.
