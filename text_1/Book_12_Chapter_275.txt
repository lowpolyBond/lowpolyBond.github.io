Once upon a time, a wise man named Asita was sitting quietly. Narada, a traveler who loved to ask questions, came up to him.

"Wise Asita," Narada asked, "where did the world come from?  And where does everything go when it disappears?"

Asita smiled. "Narada," he said, "the world is made from five special things: Earth, Water, Air, Fire, and Space.  These are like magic building blocks!  Time, which is like a clever builder, uses these blocks to create everything you see."

"These five things are always there," Asita explained. "They never disappear, they're super strong. There's nothing more important than these five things.  They’re like the very first ingredients of everything.”

"But where do things go when they end?" Narada asked.

"They go back into these five things," said Asita.  "Think about it: your body is made of earth, your breath is air, your blood is water, the light you see is fire, and the space around you is space!"

"But there's more," Asita continued,  "We also have senses – our eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin.  These senses let us experience the world.  Then, we have our mind which helps us think, and our understanding which helps us learn. And finally there is the soul, which is special and always lives inside us.  When we die, the soul goes back to the five basic things it is made from.  The body goes back into the earth, the breath back into the air, and so on.”

"The soul moves from one body to another," Asita said, "like moving from one house to another.  It's all because of our actions. Good actions lead to good things and bad actions, well, those lead to something else. But the soul itself never truly dies. It just keeps changing."

"So we shouldn't be sad when people die," Asita added.  "The soul just moves on.  Only those who don’t understand this get upset." The soul is always alone; it creates its own happiness and sadness.  One day, after many lives, the soul finally joins the great spirit, Brahma, and finds true peace.  It's all part of a big, amazing journey!
