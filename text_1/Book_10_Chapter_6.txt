King Dhritarashtra asked his advisor, Sanjaya, "Sanjaya, what happened when Ashwatthama, Drona's son, reached the camp’s gate?"

Sanjaya said, "Ashwatthama, angry and with Kripa and Kritavarma, went to the camp gate.  There, a HUGE, scary warrior guarded the entrance! This warrior was super strong and bright, like the sun and moon! He wore a bloody tiger skin and a black deer hide.  He had a HUGE snake as a necklace and even bigger snakes wrapped around his arms!  He had lots of weapons, and fire seemed to come from his mouth and eyes!  He was so scary, mountains would break into a thousand pieces just looking at him!  Hundreds of little warriors even popped out of the fire around him!

Ashwatthama, brave but a little foolish, threw lots of magical weapons at this huge warrior. But the warrior just ate them up!  It was like throwing water on a big fire – it didn't even slow him down!  Then Ashwatthama threw a flaming spear, but that broke too! He threw a super sharp sword, and that disappeared inside the warrior! He even threw a giant club, but the warrior ate that too!

Finally, Ashwatthama ran out of weapons.  He looked around and saw the sky filled with pictures of Lord Krishna!  Ashwatthama felt very sad and scared. He remembered what Kripa and Kritavarma had told him before:  "Don't fight people who are defenseless:  cows, priests, women, your friends, or anyone weak or scared."  

Ashwatthama realized he'd been wrong to attack this warrior, whoever he was.  He said, “If you don't listen to your friends, bad things happen.  I was foolish to ignore them. It’s like getting lost in a dark forest if you don’t follow the right path.  This warrior is here because of my bad choices.  I can't win this fight; it’s my destiny! Only the gods can help me now.”

Ashwatthama was very afraid, and he prayed to Lord Shiva, a very powerful god, for help. He asked Shiva, the strong one with the trident, to protect him from this scary warrior."
