Yudhishthira, the good king, asked Bhishma, the wise elder, "I know what kindness is, but I don't know what being mean is.  How can I tell a mean person?"

Bhishma smiled. "Mean people always do bad things," he said.  "They love to gossip and make others look bad.  They think everyone is cheating them.  They brag about their good deeds, even if they aren't really good. They're jealous of others and sneaky. They never share, and they're always boasting. They don't trust anyone. They're stingy and only praise their friends. They hate peaceful people who live in the forest.  They like hurting others and don't care if they're right or wrong.  They lie a lot, are never happy, and are always greedy. They're cruel!"

Bhishma continued, "A mean person thinks good people are annoying.  They think everyone is mean like them, so they don't trust anyone.  They only talk about other people's mistakes, but never their own! If someone is kind to them, they think they've tricked that person. They regret even giving gifts!  A mean person secretly eats the best food all by themselves, even if others are hungry.  A kind person shares their food first with wise people, then with friends and family. That's how you know the difference. Always stay away from mean people, Yudhishthira."
