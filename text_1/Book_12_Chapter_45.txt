After the big battle, King Yudhishthira sent everyone home.  He was so happy!  He then talked to his brothers, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva.  "You are all hurt and tired," he said. "You suffered so much during our exile in the forest.  Now, rest and enjoy your victory!  Meet me tomorrow morning."

Bhima, the strongest, went to live in Duryodhana's old palace. It was huge and beautiful, filled with servants and shiny jewels!  Arjuna got Dussasana's palace, which was just as amazing, with a golden gate!

Nakula got Durmarshana's palace.  It was even better! It sparkled with gold and gems. It was like a palace fit for a king of the gods!  Sahadeva, who was always kind, got Durmukha's palace. It was gorgeous too, with lots of comfy beds and beautiful women.

Yuyutsu, Vidura, Sanjaya, Sudharman, and Dhaumya went back to their old homes.  Arjuna's friend, Satyaki, went with Arjuna to his new palace.

That night, all the brothers ate delicious food and slept well. The next morning, happy and rested, they went to see their brother, King Yudhishthira.
