A huge battle began!  The Pandavas and the Kauravas fought.  It was a scary, noisy battle!

Bhima fought Jalasandha, a really strong warrior. Yudhishthira fought Kritavarman.  Dhrishtadyumna, who was super brave, fought Drona.  Lots and lots of arrows flew through the air!

The battlefield was a mess!  Broken weapons, torn clothes, and dead soldiers everywhere.  The ground was covered in blood.  It looked like a scary forest of red flowers.  Even big elephants and horses were hurt.

Vultures, jackals, and other animals came to eat the dead soldiers and animals. It was very sad.

The soldiers fought hard with swords, spears, and axes.  They even fought with their bare hands!  Elephants fought other elephants, making loud, angry noises.

Dhrishtadyumna was very clever. He wanted to fight Drona.  He jumped onto Dronaâ€™s chariot! He moved quickly between the horses and Drona couldn't hit him.  It was amazing!

Drona was angry! He shot many arrows at Dhrishtadyumna. He cut his shield and sword.  He even shot Dhrishtadyumna's horses!

But then, Satyaki, another brave warrior, came to help. He stopped Drona's arrows!  Dhrishtadyumna was safe!

Drona tried to shoot Satyaki, but Satyaki fought back and shot Drona too. Then, other warriors helped Dhrishtadyumna leave the battle. The fighting was so fierce and scary!
