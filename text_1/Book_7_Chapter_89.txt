King Dhritarashtra asked, "My army was defeated by Arjuna!  Who fought him bravely? Did anyone actually fight back, or did they all hide behind Drona?"

Sanjaya answered, "Arjuna, son of Indra, was incredibly strong! He shot arrows so fast, many of our heroes were killed or ran away. No one could even look at him!

Then, your son, Duhsasana, got angry. He charged at Arjuna! Duhsasana was strong, wearing shiny gold armor. He brought many, many elephants to attack Arjuna.  It was a huge, noisy battle!  Elephants trumpeted, horns blew, and arrows whizzed!

But Arjuna, brave as a lion, fought back! He was like a giant fish swimming through stormy waves, piercing through the elephants.  He was like the sun on the day the world ends, so bright and powerful! The sounds of battle were deafening – horses, wheels, shouting, arrows, and Arjuna's bow, Gandiva!

Arjuna’s arrows were like poisonous snakes. Thousands of arrows hit the elephants! They fell down, crying out in pain. Arjuna even cut off the heads of the soldiers riding the elephants!  The battlefield was covered in fallen soldiers, elephants, and broken weapons. It looked terrible!

Duhsasana’s army was completely defeated! He was hurt and scared, so he and his soldiers ran away to hide behind Drona."
