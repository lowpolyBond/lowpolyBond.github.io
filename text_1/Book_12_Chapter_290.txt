Once upon a time, a wise king named Yudhishthira was curious about a powerful magician named Sukra.  He asked his grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandpa, why did Sukra help the bad guys (Asuras) and not the good guys (Devas)? Why did he make the gods weaker?  And how did he get the name Sukra?"

Bhishma said, "Listen, Yudhishthira!  Sukra had a good reason.  Kuvera, the rich treasure keeper of the gods, was very greedy.  Sukra, who was super strong because of his magic, secretly took all of Kuvera's riches!

Kuvera was furious! He ran to Shiva, the strongest god of all. He shouted, "Sukra stole my treasure! He used magic to take it!"

Shiva was angry!  His eyes turned red. He picked up his spear, ready to punish Sukra. But Sukra, using his magic, knew what Shiva was planning. He cleverly hid himself on the tip of Shiva's spear!

Shiva couldn't throw the spear because Sukra was on it!  He bent the spear into a bow, which is now called the Pinaka bow. Then, Shiva did something surprising!  He swallowed Sukra whole!

Yudhishthira gasped, "Swallowed him?  What happened then?"

Bhishma smiled, "Shiva went underwater and meditated for a very, very long time.  When he came back, he saw that Sukra had become even more powerful because of the magic inside Shiva's body!  Sukra chanted prayers to escape. Shiva, needing to get rid of him, said, 'Go out through my… uh… the other way!'"

"The other way?" Yudhishthira giggled.

"Yes," Bhishma said. "Sukra had to find his way out through a very unusual path. Because of this, he got the name Sukra, and he couldn't fly as high as before.  Shiva was still angry, but Shiva's wife, Parvati, stopped him from hurting Sukra. She said Sukra was now her son."

"So," Bhishma finished, "Sukra was allowed to go free. That's the story of Sukra, the powerful magician who went on a very strange adventure!"
