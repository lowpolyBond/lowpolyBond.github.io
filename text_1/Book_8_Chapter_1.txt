Once upon a time, after a great battle, the good Drona was killed.  His son and Duryodhana, the Kaurava king, were very sad. They were all very upset and couldn't sleep.  They missed Drona a lot.

Duryodhana, Karna (the son of the charioteer), Duhshasana, and Shakuni were together that night. They felt terrible about how they had treated the Pandavas, especially Draupadi, the Pandavas' wife, whom they had treated badly in a game. They felt very, very sorry. It felt like a hundred years before morning came!

The next day, after praying, they went to battle. They made Karna their new leader.  They hoped he would win the war for them. The Pandavas also got ready to fight.  A huge battle began! It was a very scary battle, and it lasted for two days!  

Karna, the new leader, fought bravely, but in the end, Arjuna killed him.  Sanjaya, a messenger, rushed to tell the blind King Dhritarashtra all about the battle and Karna's death.

King Dhritarashtra was already very sad because his best warriors, like Bhishma and Drona, had already died. When he heard about Karna's death, he was even sadder!  He missed Karna a lot, because he had believed Karna would win the war for his sons.  It shows how hard it is to stop living even when you're very, very sad, even when you've lost everyone you love.  The king just couldn't stop living, even after so much sadness!  He wanted to know more about all that happened, and all about his ancestors who fought in the great war.
