Once upon a time, in a great war, Yudhishthira, the leader of the Pandavas, learned some scary news. His spies told him that the Kauravas were boasting!

Duryodhana, the Kaurava leader, asked his strongest warriors how quickly they could defeat the Pandavas.  

Bhishma said he could do it in a month.  Drona said the same. Kripa said two months.  Ashwatthama, Drona's son, said ten nights. Even Karna, a powerful warrior, said he could win in just five days!

Yudhishthira was worried. He went to his brother Arjuna, the greatest archer, and asked, "Arjuna, how long will it take *you* to defeat them?"

Arjuna looked at Krishna, his best friend and advisor. Then he smiled.  "Brother," he said, "Bhishma, Drona, and the others are very strong warriors. They could easily defeat us. But don't worry! With Krishna by my side, I could defeat everyone, even the gods, in the blink of an eye! I have a powerful weapon, a secret weapon given to me by Lord Shiva himself.  It's a weapon so powerful that it can destroy the entire world! Bhishma, Drona, and the others don't even know about this weapon.

"But," Arjuna added, "it's not right to use such a powerful weapon against ordinary soldiers. We will fight them fairly.  Besides, we have many brave warriors on our side! We have Bhima, the twins Nakula and Sahadeva, Yudhamanyu, Uttamaujas, Virata, Drupada, Sikhandin, Yuyudhana, Dhristadyumna, and the mighty Abhimanyu!  We even have Draupadi's five sons! We also have Hidimba's son Ghatotkacha and his son Anjanaparvan.  You are also a strong warrior, brother!  You are as powerful as the god Indra.  Anyone you look at angrily will be defeated!"

Yudhishthira felt much better hearing Arjuna's words.  He knew that with such brave and powerful allies, they had a good chance of winning the war.
