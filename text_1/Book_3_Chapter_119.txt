Once upon a time, after a big battle, the Pandava brothers (Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva) and their friends, the Vrishnis, went to a holy place by the sea called Prabhasa.  They were all very sad.

Valarama, a strong and handsome friend, spoke to Krishna, the Pandavas’ cousin.  He was confused.  "Look at Yudhishthira," he said. "He's a good king, but he's lost everything! He lives in the forest, wearing only tree bark.  Duryodhana, the bad king who cheated him, rules the land. It doesn't seem fair!  Why is goodness being punished?"

Valarama pointed out how strong Bhima was.  Bhima had once defeated armies all by himself! Now he was hungry and thin.  Sahadeva, another Pandava brother, had also won many battles in the south, but now he was poor and living in the forest.  Nakula was another great warrior, but now he only ate fruits and roots.  Even Draupadi, the Pandavas’ wife, who was used to a comfortable life, was now suffering.  Arjuna, the best archer, and the other Pandavas’ sons, were also sad and poor.

Valarama couldn't understand why good people suffered and bad people prospered. He wondered if Duryodhana would even be sorry for what he had done.  He thought maybe Duryodhana had asked for bad advice from evil spirits.  Valarama felt angry that Bhishma, Kripa, Drona and the old king, who helped Duryodhana, were still happy while the good Pandavas suffered. He knew that Bhima, when he had the chance, would fight back and defeat Duryodhana.  But until then, he was heartbroken to see his friends in such misery.
