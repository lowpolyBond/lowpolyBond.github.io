The Pandavas lived in a big, beautiful house made of lacquer.  Purochana, a mean man who worked for their enemies, watched them. He thought they were safe and happy.  After a whole year, Yudhishthira, the oldest Pandava, told his brothers, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva: "It's time to escape!  We need to set the house on fire and get out!"

That night, Kunti, their mother, had a big feast.  Many people came, including a tired mother and her five children. They ate and drank so much that they fell fast asleep.  Then, a strong wind blew.

Bhima, the strongest Pandava, started a fire.  Whoosh! The house went up in flames! The Pandavas quickly went through a secret tunnel under the house.  They escaped!

The townspeople woke up and saw the fire.  They were very sad. They thought the Pandavas were dead,  burned along with Purochana, the mean man who set the fire.  They didn't know the Pandavas were safe in the tunnel.

The Pandavas, with Kunti, escaped the tunnel. They were tired and scared. But Bhima, who was super strong and fast, carried everyone! He put his mother on his shoulders, the twins on his sides, and Yudhishthira and Arjuna on his arms.  He ran so fast, he even broke some trees! They escaped the fire and were safe.
