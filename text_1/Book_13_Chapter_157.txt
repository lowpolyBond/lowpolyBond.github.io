Once upon a time, the gods were in big trouble.  A mean giant named Mada trapped them in his mouth!  Then, a wise man named Chyavana took away their land, the Earth.  The gods were very sad.  They had lost their home in the sky, and now their land too!

They went to Brahma, the great creator, for help. Brahma told them, "Go ask the wise Brahmanas for help.  If you make them happy, they'll help you get your home and land back!"

So, the gods went to the Brahmanas and asked for help.  The Brahmanas asked, "Who are we fighting?" The gods said, "The Kapas!"  The Kapas were powerful beings who lived in the sky.

The Brahmanas said, "We'll defeat them, but first, we need to bring them down to Earth." They started a special magic ritual to defeat the Kapas.

The Kapas heard about this and sent a messenger named Dhanin to stop them. Dhanin said, "The Kapas are just like you! They are wise, good, and holy.  Why fight them?"  He told the Brahmanas how good and kind the Kapas were.  They never did anything wrong! They were very kind and respectful.

But the Brahmanas said, "We're helping the gods!  The Kapas must be defeated!"  Dhanin went back.

The Kapas, hearing this, got angry and attacked the Brahmanas. The Brahmanas used powerful magic fire to defeat the Kapas!  The gods then fought and won a great battle against the remaining Danavas.  They didnâ€™t even know the Brahmanas helped them win!

Then, Narada, a messenger god, told the gods that the Brahmanas had actually won the fight. The gods were very grateful.  Because of the Brahmanas, the gods got their power back and even became immortal!

The Wind God told this story to Arjuna, a great warrior. Arjuna listened carefully and said, "I always help the Brahmanas!  I honor them and they are very important to me."

The Wind God said, "Keep protecting the Brahmanas, Arjuna.  They are very important. But be careful; one day, someone from the Bhrigu family will cause you trouble."  Arjuna promised to always protect and honor the Brahmanas.
