Once upon a time, there was a big snake sacrifice.  The priests, dressed in black, were busy.  They poured special butter into a huge fire.  They chanted magic words.

The snakes were scared!  They trembled. The priests called out the snakes' names as they poured more butter into the fire.  The snakes, big and small, slithered into the flames.  They hissed and cried out to each other.

Some snakes were white, some were black, some were blue.  Some were tiny, and some were as long as a whole field!  Some were as big as elephants!  These scary snakes, with their sharp teeth and strong bodies, all fell into the fire.  Hundreds, thousands, even tens of thousands of snakes burned.  They were all cursed, so they couldn't escape.  It was a sad, fiery sight.
