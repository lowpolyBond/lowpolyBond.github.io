Once upon a time, the Pandava brothers lived in Khandavaprastha.  They were very strong and brave, and many kings obeyed them.  Draupadi, their wife, loved them very much, and they loved her. Everyone was happy.

One day, some bad guys stole a priest's cows.  The priest was very sad. He ran to the Pandavas and cried, "Help! My cows are stolen!  It's not right!  You must catch the thieves!"

Arjuna, the best archer, wanted to help. But Yudhishthira, his older brother, was in a room with Draupadi and Krishna.  The Pandavas had a rule: only one brother could be in that room at a time with Draupadi.  Arjuna couldn't go in there!

Arjuna thought, "I must help the priest! It's more important than the rule."  He knew he might get in trouble. He might even have to go live in the forest! But helping the priest was the right thing to do.

So, Arjuna went into the room and got his bow and arrows.  He quickly went with the priest and chased the thieves.  He was so strong and skillful, he caught them! He gave the cows back to the happy priest.

Then Arjuna went back and apologized to Yudhishthira. "I broke our rule," he said.  "I must go live in the forest."

Yudhishthira loved his brother. He said, "It's okay, Arjuna. You did the right thing.  You don't have to go to the forest.  A younger brother can always go into the room where an older brother is."

Arjuna said, "But I promised to follow the rules.  Telling the truth is very important to me."

So, even though Yudhishthira said it was alright, Arjuna kept his promise. He went to live in the forest for twelve years.  He was a very good and honest brother.
