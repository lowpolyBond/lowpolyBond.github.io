Once upon a time, a wise king named Yudhishthira was curious about Rama, a very brave and good man.  He asked his friend Bhishma, "Rama was born into a family of wise priests, but he became a warrior! How did that happen?"

Bhishma said, "That's a long story! It all started with a wise priest named Chyavana. Chyavana saw a problem coming for his family. He knew that one of their descendants would become a warrior, which wasn't right for their family tradition.  So, Chyavana decided to visit King Kusika. Chyavana asked Kusika for a favor. He wanted to stay at the palace and be served."

King Kusika was very kind. He said, "Of course, holy man! Anything you need."

Chyavana said, "I don't want your riches or your kingdom.  I want you and your queen to serve me for a while.‚Äù The king and queen were happy to do this.

Chyavana told them to take care of him and massage his feet while he slept.  He slept for 21 whole days! The king and queen stayed up the entire time, serving him faithfully. They didn't eat or rest.

After 21 days, Chyavana woke up and disappeared! The king and queen were very sad, but then they felt something amazing. The queen was pregnant! Their son was named Jamadagni. Jamadagni's son, Rama, became a great warrior, even though his family was known for being wise priests.

That's why Rama was a warrior, even though his family were priests. It all started because of Chyavana's plan to make sure his family's tradition was kept.  The king and queen's faithfulness was rewarded with the birth of a great hero!
