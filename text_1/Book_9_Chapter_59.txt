The great battle was over.  Duryodhana, the Kaurava king, lay on the ground, like a giant tree blown down in a storm.  The Pandavas were happy.  They had won!

Bhima, the strongest Pandava, went up to Duryodhana.  Bhima was angry.  He remembered how Duryodhana had laughed at Draupadi, a kind princess, when she was treated unfairly. Duryodhana had even called her mean names!

"You hurt Draupadi!" Bhima roared. "Now you will pay!"  Bhima then put his foot on Duryodhana's head.  He was very angry.  He yelled, "You laughed at us! Now itâ€™s our turn!"

Bhima bragged about winning the war. He told his brothers and friends how the Kauravas, Duryodhana's family, had been defeated. He didn't care if he went to heaven or not. He had avenged Draupadi.

But Yudhishthira, the kindest Pandava, was sad.  He saw Bhima stepping on Duryodhana's head.  He didn't like it.

"Bhima," Yudhishthira said softly, "Duryodhana was a king, and he was our cousin.  He is defeated and hurt.  We should not be mean to him. This isn't right."

Yudhishthira felt sorry for Duryodhana.  He knew Duryodhana had made many bad choices, but he also knew that Duryodhana's family and friends were all gone.  Yudhishthira felt sad about the war and all the people who had died. He felt even sadder thinking about all the widows and their grief. He felt very sad and worried that he and his brothers would be punished for all the killing.  He wondered if they deserved to go to heaven or hell. He wished things had been different.
