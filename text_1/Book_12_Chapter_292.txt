Long ago, a wise man named Parasara told a king a story about life.  He said our body is like a chariot. Our mind is the driver.  Our senses are the horses. To be smart, we must use knowledge to control our senses, like reins on horses.

He said the best way to live is to focus on good things, not on making money.  Learn from wise teachers, not just from friends.  You only get one life, so don't waste it! Always try to be better.

Life is like having different colored clothes.  If you have a good life (a bright color), don't do bad things and lose it.  Doing good things makes your life brighter.  Doing bad things makes it darker.  If you do something bad without knowing, it's okay.  Just be sorry.  But if you do something bad knowing it's bad, that's really sad.  A good person would never do a bad thing, even if it helped them.

Imagine a dirty white cloth. You can clean it. But a black cloth is hard to clean. Sin is like that.  If you do something bad and then try to be good, you still have to deal with the bad things you did.  Wise people say that if you did something bad without knowing, good things can make it better. But if you did it knowing, it stays.

Everything you think and do has an effect.  Big bad things have big bad consequences. Even little bad things have consequences.  Don't do things that even good people wouldn't do.  Think before you act.  Good things you do with your brain are better than things you do without thinking. Doing good things adds to your goodness, like adding water to water.

Be a good king! Protect your people.  Do good things, be kind to everyone, respect your elders, and tell the truth. If you live this way, you'll be happy.
