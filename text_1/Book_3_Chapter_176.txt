Once upon a time, the Pandava brothers left their beautiful home high in the mountains.  It was a magical place with waterfalls, birds, elephants, and even magical helpers!  But leaving it made them sad.

Soon, they saw Mount Kailasa, a mountain so big and fluffy, it looked like clouds!  This made them happy again. They walked through amazing places – mountains, caves, forests full of deer and elephants, and sparkling rivers and lakes. They slept in caves and beautiful forests.

After a long journey, they reached a wise king’s home.  They told him all about their adventures.  They stayed a night and then went to another beautiful place with a special lake that even the gods visited.  They felt happy and peaceful there, just like holy people in a wonderful garden.

The brothers stayed for a month in a place called Badari.  Then, they traveled to a king named Suvahu’s kingdom, far, far away, across snowy mountains and many lands.  King Suvahu was so happy to see them!  They all had a nice rest.

Next, they went to another mountain with colorful slopes and snowy tops.  They found a forest full of animals and spent a whole year there, hunting and enjoying themselves.

One day, Bhima, the strongest brother, found a giant hungry snake!  It was very scary, but Yudhishthira, the kindest brother, saved him.

After twelve years of adventures, the brothers reached a desert. They found a beautiful lake called Dwaitabana. People who lived there were very holy and kind. They welcomed the Pandavas with mats and water. The lake was surrounded by many special trees. The Pandavas were very happy living near the lake, which was a favorite spot for magical beings and holy people.  They lived there happily for a long time.
