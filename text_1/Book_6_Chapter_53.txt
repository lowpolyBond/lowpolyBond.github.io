King Dhritarashtra asked Sanjaya, "Sanjaya, tell me about the amazing fight between Drona and Dhrishtadyumna!  Even Bhishma, the strongest warrior, couldn't always win. How could this happen?"

Sanjaya said, "King, listen!  Dhrishtadyumna was incredibly strong, almost unbeatable! Drona was amazing too.  He shot many arrows at Dhrishtadyumna. He even hit Dhrishtadyumna's chariot and horses!

But Dhrishtadyumna fought back bravely! He shot nine arrows at Drona and yelled, "Wait!" Drona, very angry, shot even more arrows at Dhrishtadyumna. He aimed a powerful arrow â€“ it looked like a deadly thunderbolt!  Everyone screamed!

But Dhrishtadyumna was so strong, he sliced the arrow in half!  Then he showered Drona with his own arrows! The Pandavas and their friends cheered!  Dhrishtadyumna threw a shiny spear at Drona, but Drona cut it into three pieces!

Dhrishtadyumna kept shooting arrows, but Drona broke his bow!  Dhrishtadyumna grabbed a heavy club, but Drona broke that too!  Dhrishtadyumna was knocked out of his chariot.  He fought on foot, but Drona kept shooting him with arrows.

Then, strong Bhima came to help! He shot many arrows at Drona and rescued Dhrishtadyumna, getting him a new chariot.  King Duryodhana sent his Kalinga army to help Drona.  Then there was a HUGE battle between Bhima and the Kalinga army.  Drona fought Virata and Drupada while Dhrishtadyumna went to help King Yudhishthira. It was a terrifying, earth-shaking battle!"
