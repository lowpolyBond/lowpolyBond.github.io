One hot day, a big battle was happening.  Bhishma, a very strong warrior, was fighting for the Kauravas.  He was surrounded by five brave friends: Durmukha, Kritavarman, Kripa, Salya, and Vivinsati. They protected him like bodyguards!

Bhishma's chariot zipped through the enemy, the Pandavas.  He was so fast and strong, he knocked down enemy soldiers and even elephants!

Abhimanyu, a brave young warrior, got really angry. He zoomed his chariot towards Bhishma!  Abhimanyu's chariot was beautiful, with a golden flag. He fought bravely, hitting Kritavarman with one arrow, Salya with five, and even Bhishma with nine! He chopped down enemy flags and even an enemy driver's head!

Abhimanyu was so good with his bow and arrow, everyone watched in amazement. He was like Arjuna himself, the best archer!  His bow twanged like firecrackers!

Bhishma fought back, hitting Abhimanyu with arrows.  But Abhimanyu was strong and didn't give up! He kept shooting arrows, cutting down Bhishma's flag. Everyone cheered!

Then Bhishma used magic weapons, shooting thousands of arrows at Abhimanyu.  To help Abhimanyu, many Pandava heroes rushed to his side.  But Bhishma was powerful and hit many of them too.  He even knocked down Bhima's flag!

Bhima got angry and shot back at Bhishma, hitting him and his friends.  Uttara, a brave elephant rider, also charged, but Salya fought back and even killed Uttara's elephant!

Sweta, Uttara's brother, got super angry! He wanted revenge. He shot arrows at Salya, but seven other warriors jumped in to protect Salya. Sweta was so strong, he broke their bows!  They threw spears, but Sweta broke those too.  He even hit Rukmaratha, one of Salyaâ€™s friends, so hard he fainted!  Sweta then destroyed their flags.

Then, the Kauravas rescued Salya.  A huge, scary battle happened. Bhishma shot many arrows at Abhimanyu, Bhima, Satyaki, and many other Pandava warriors. The battle was very messy, with chariots and elephants everywhere!
