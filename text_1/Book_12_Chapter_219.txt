Once upon a time, a wise king named Janadeva was very confused. He wondered what happened after we die.  He asked a great teacher, Panchasikha, "If we forget everything when we die, what's the point of learning anything? What's the difference between being smart and being silly?"

Panchasikha smiled. He explained, "After death isn't just nothingness, or something we can easily understand.  Our bodies are made of earth, water, air, fire, and space.  These things join together to make us, and then they separate again.  Our bodies have parts that help us see, hear, taste, smell, and touch. Our minds use these parts to learn about the world."

He continued, "Our minds can feel happy, sad, or calm.  Everything we see, hear, and feel teaches us.  Knowing the truth is the most important thing.  This is what helps us understand everything."

Panchasikha said, "If you think your body and senses are all you are, you'll be unhappy. But if you understand that you are more than just your body, you won't be sad.  To be truly happy, we need to let go of our attachment to things."

He taught Janadeva that our bodies are like a house made of many parts.  We have parts for hearing, seeing, moving, and talking.  We also have a mind which controls all of these.  If we could let go of our minds and focus on a bigger truth, we will be truly free.

Panchasikha explained that true happiness isn’t found in things or our feelings. He used examples like a river flowing into the ocean, or a silk worm leaving its cocoon.  Just as the river loses its name in the ocean, we lose our worries when we understand the truth.

King Janadeva listened carefully. He understood that even though our bodies die, something inside us—our true self—goes on. He let go of his worries and became very happy.  If you listen carefully and think about what Panchasikha taught, you too can find peace and happiness.
