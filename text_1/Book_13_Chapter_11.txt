Once upon a time, a wise king named Yudhishthira asked his grandpa, Bhishma, a very important question.  "Grandpa," he said, "where does good luck live?  In what kind of person?"

Bhishma smiled. "I'll tell you a story," he said.  "A beautiful princess named Rukmini once asked the Goddess of Good Luck the very same question!  She asked the goddess, 'Goddess, who do you live with?  And who do you avoid?'"

The Goddess of Good Luck, who was as pretty as the moon, answered kindly. "I live with people who are kind and hardworking," she said. "They're always polite, they pray, they’re thankful, and they control their anger. They always do what they say they will do and they are brave and strong."

"But," she continued, "I never live with people who are lazy or mean. I don't live with liars, cheaters, or people who are unkind to others, especially their teachers and elders. I don't live with people who are always angry or complain about little things."

The Goddess said, "I also don't live with people who are never happy with what they have,  who don’t try to improve their lives, or who only do things that they say they will, but do something else. I live with those who do their jobs well and are good to everyone. I especially like those who are kind, forgiving, and helpful to their families, friends and neighbours."

She then talked about women. "I live with women who are truthful and kind.  They take care of their homes and are respectful to their husbands.  They're also neat and tidy. But I avoid women who gossip, are lazy, or who aren't kind. I also don’t like women who spend a lot of time at other people's homes rather than their own."

"I live in many places," the goddess explained. "I'm in beautiful clothes, shiny jewelry, happy animals, and blooming flowers. I'm in flowing rivers, cloudy skies, and even in strong elephants! I live in homes where people are kind and pray to the gods.  I live with good people who do their jobs well:  farmers who grow food, warriors who are brave and honest, and people who serve others kindly. Most of all, I live in the heart of a good and kind God, Narayana."

"The important thing," the Goddess finished, "is that if you are kind, hardworking, and honest, good luck will find you!"
