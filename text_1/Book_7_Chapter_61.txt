Once upon a time, there was a very good king named Dilipa.  He was a kind and generous king, just like the sun!

He loved to give big feasts and ceremonies called sacrifices.  Lots and lots of wise people came to these feasts.  The roads leading to his feasts were even made of gold!  Even the gods came to visit King Dilipa because he was so good and fair.

King Dilipa’s chariot, a fancy cart pulled by horses, was amazing.  Even when he drove it through water, the wheels never sank!  That was a miracle!

At his feasts, people chanted holy words, bows were strung, and everyone had delicious food and drink.  It was a very happy place!  Everyone who met King Dilipa became good and went to heaven after they died.

Sadly, even good King Dilipa died one day.  Now, Narada, a wise storyteller, is telling this to someone who is sad about their son. Narada says, “Don't be so sad! Your son wasn't as good and generous as King Dilipa. Dilipa gave away everything he had and always did good things. Your son didn't do that.”  So, let's remember King Dilipa for his kindness and generosity!
