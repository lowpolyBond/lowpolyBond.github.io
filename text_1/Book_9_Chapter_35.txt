Once upon a time, before a big battle, Rama, a powerful warrior, told his cousin Krishna, "I won't help either side in the fight! I'm going on a trip!"  He went away.  Later, King Janamejaya asked a wise man, "Tell me about Rama's journey and how he saw the battle!"

The wise man said, "First, Krishna tried to make peace between the two armies.  But the king didn't listen.  So Krishna went back to his friends.  He said, 'Let's fight under the Pushya star!'

Rama, Krishna's brother, wanted to help the other side.  He was angry when Krishna wouldn't let him.  So, Rama decided to go on a long pilgrimage to a river called Sarasvati. He took all his friends and family.

Rama's trip was amazing! He brought lots of things: food, priests, gold, silver, cows, horses, elephantsâ€”everything for a long journey! They gave food and clothes to everyone they met along the way. The road was beautiful, like heaven! They were very happy.

Rama gave away many gifts to the priests and poor people.  He gave away cows, horses, and even servants!  Finally, his journey took him to the battlefield.

Janamejaya asked, "Tell me about the special places along the Sarasvati River!"

The wise man said, "One place is called Prabhasa. The moon god, Soma, was very sick.  He was cursed because he loved one wife more than the others.  The other wives were very angry! Their father cursed Soma to be sick.

Soma got better after bathing in the Prabhasa.  He had to be fair to all his wives.  After that, Soma's light shone brightly again.   That's why it's a special place!"

The wise man continued to tell Janamejaya about other special places Rama visited on his pilgrimage, explaining how they got their names and why they were important.
