Long ago, the gods and the demons were always fighting.  The demons were winning!  Indra, the king of the gods, was very worried. His army was losing badly.  He needed a strong leader to help them win.

Indra went to the Manasa mountains to think.  He heard a woman crying for help.  A mean demon, Kesin, was hurting her.  He was big and strong, like a mountain of metal!

Indra, brave and strong, told Kesin to leave the woman alone.  Kesin laughed. He threw his heavy mace at Indra!  Indra used his magic thunderbolt to smash the mace.  Kesin, angry, threw a giant rock.  Indra smashed that too! The rock hit Kesin, and he ran away.

Indra asked the woman, "Who are you? What happened?"  This is just the beginning of the amazing story of Kartikeya’s birth!  I’ll tell you more soon!
