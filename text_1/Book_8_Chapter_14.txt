Once upon a time, during a great battle, two brave warriors, Srutakarman and Citrasena, fought each other.

Srutakarman was very angry. He shot fifty arrows at Citrasena!  Citrasena fought back, hitting Srutakarman with nine arrows.  He even hit Srutakarman's chariot driver with five more!

Srutakarman got even angrier. He shot one special arrow that hit Citrasena really hard. Citrasena felt a lot of pain and fainted.  While Citrasena was asleep, Srutakarman shot ninety more arrows!

When Citrasena woke up, he was very mad! He broke Srutakarman's bow with one arrow and then hit him with seven more. Srutakarman grabbed a new bow and shot so many arrows at Citrasena that he looked like he was wearing lots of sparkly jewelry!

Then Citrasena shot an arrow right into Srutakarman's chest! "Wait!" he shouted. Srutakarman bled a lot, but he was still fighting!

Srutakarman broke Citrasena's bow and shot three hundred arrows at him.  Then, with one final arrow, he cut off Citrasena's head!  It fell to the ground like a falling star.

Citrasena's army was very upset. They attacked Srutakarman, but he was so strong and shot so many arrows, they ran away!

Another warrior, Prativindhya, fought Citra (another warrior).  They shot arrows at each other, breaking bows and hitting each otherâ€™s chariots. Citra threw a special dart, but Prativindhya broke it into three pieces!

Citra then threw a big, heavy club. It smashed Prativindhya's chariot and hurt his horses and driver. Prativindhya fought back and threw a spear that hurt Citra badly. Citra fell down.

Citra's army attacked Prativindhya, but he was strong too, and he pushed them back.  Many soldiers died. Finally, only one soldier, Drona's son, kept fighting. He fought bravely against a very strong warrior named Bhimasena.  It was a very fierce battle, like a battle between giants!
