Once upon a time, a wise man named Galava was traveling with a princess named Madhavi.  A magical storyteller, Narada, told everyone what happened next.

Galava said, "Madhavi, we're going to see King Divodasa! He's a strong and kind king. Don't worry; he's a good man."

They went to see King Divodasa.  The king welcomed them kindly. Galava asked the king to marry Madhavi so she could have a baby.

King Divodasa said, "I've already heard about this! I'm happy to marry her. It's an honor you came to me.  I'll have one son with her."

Galava gave Madhavi to the king.  They got married.  The king and Madhavi were very happy together, just like many other famous couples:  the sun god with Prabhavati, the fire god with Swaha, and many more wonderful couples from ancient stories!

Madhavi had a baby boy named Pratardana.  Then, Galava returned. He said to King Divodasa, "It's time for me and Madhavi to leave. Please keep the horses you promised me."

The king gave Madhavi back to Galava.  He was a kind and honest king, and he kept his word.
