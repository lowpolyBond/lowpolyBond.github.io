Once upon a time, during a great battle, the Kuru army was losing badly.  It was scared!  King Duryodhana and his friends—Kripa, Kritavarma, Drona's son, and others—saw their army falling apart like a broken ship in a storm. They rushed to help.

The battle raged! Kripa, a great warrior, shot so many arrows it looked like a swarm of locusts! Shikhandi, a brave Pandava warrior, fought back fiercely. They shot arrows at each other, back and forth. Kripa hit Shikhandi with ten arrows!  Shikhandi, angry, hit Kripa back with seven!  Kripa then shot so many arrows at Shikhandi’s chariot that Shikhandi had to jump off!

Then, another great warrior, Dhrishtadyumna, joined the fight to help Shikhandi. But Kritavarma stopped him.  Drona’s son stopped Yudhishthira.  Duryodhana fought Nakula and Sahadeva.  Karna fought Bhima. Everyone was fighting!

Kripa kept shooting arrows at Shikhandi.  Shikhandi, even without his chariot, kept fighting bravely, cutting Kripa’s arrows with his sword!  Kripa then broke Shikhandi's shield.

Just then, a young prince named Suketu rushed to help Shikhandi. He shot lots of arrows at Kripa. Kripa, angry, shot many arrows at Suketu.  He even shot off Suketu’s head! Suketu’s army was very sad and ran away.

Meanwhile, Dhrishtadyumna and Kritavarma fought like two hawks fighting over food! They shot arrows at each other until Dhrishtadyumna killed Kritavarma's charioteer.  Then, more Kaurava warriors jumped into the fight, and the battle raged on!
