King Ravana's strong warriors, Kumbhakarna and Prahasta, were defeated.  Ravana was sad. He called his brave son, Indrajit.

"Indrajit," Ravana said, "you're the strongest! You defeated the powerful Indra, the god of thunder!  Go defeat Rama, Lakshmana, and Sugriva! Use your magic arrows – they are very powerful!  No one can stand against them!"

Indrajit, a mighty warrior, jumped into his chariot. He roared his name and challenged Lakshmana to a duel.  Lakshmana accepted.

The two warriors fought fiercely! They were both skilled with magical weapons. Indrajit threw many spears, but Lakshmana cut them all in half with his arrows.  Then Angada, a strong monkey, hit Indrajit on the head with a big tree!  Indrajit fought back, but Lakshmana broke his lance. Indrajit then hit Angada with his club.  Angada, angry, threw a giant tree trunk. It smashed Indrajit’s chariot!

Indrajit used his magic to disappear!  Rama and his army looked everywhere. But Indrajit, hidden, started shooting magic arrows at Rama and Lakshmana!  He shot many, many arrows.  The monkeys searched the sky, throwing rocks.  But Indrajit, unseen, kept shooting.  Soon, Rama and Lakshmana were covered in arrows, and they fell to the ground, just like the sun and moon falling from the sky.
