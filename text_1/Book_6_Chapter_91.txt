Once upon a time, during a big, scary battle in the Mahabharata, many brave warriors fought.  Sakuni, a clever warrior, attacked the Pandavas.  Another strong warrior also joined the fight against the Pandavas.

Many soldiers, riding strong horses from faraway lands, surrounded the Pandavas.  But on the Pandava side, Iravat, Arjuna’s son, came riding in! Iravat was very strong and brave.  He was actually Arjuna's son from a secret marriage. His mother was a Naga princess.  Arjuna's uncle didn't like Arjuna and so kept Iravat hidden with his mother. But Iravat found his father and joined the battle. He rode fast horses decked in gold.

Their horses crashed together in a loud, exciting mess!  Many horses and warriors fell.  Then Sakuni's six brothers joined the fight.  They were super strong and fought fiercely.

Iravat, seeing this, told his soldiers, "Let's defeat those warriors!"  They fought bravely.  But Sakuni's sons surrounded Iravat.  They threw spears at him. Iravat was hurt, but he didn’t give up. He fought back, even tearing the spears from his body and using them as weapons! He even fought them on foot, cutting off their arms! Only one brother survived.

Duryodhana, angry at Iravat, asked Alamvusha, a powerful magician, to kill Iravat. Alamvusha hated Arjuna too, so he agreed.  He fought Iravat using magic, creating fake warriors. But Iravat also knew magic! He fought back, cutting the magician’s body into pieces!  But Alamvusha could change his shape, so he came back to life, young and strong again.

This time, Alamvusha was even stronger.  He hurt Iravat badly.  Iravat's magical snake relatives came to help, but Alamvusha ate them all!  Then Alamvusha killed Iravat.  Duryodhana and his army were happy.

The battle was terrible!  Many warriors and horses died. Arjuna, Iravat’s father, didn’t even know his son had died.  He and his friends fought hard against Bhishma, a very strong warrior on the other side.  The battle was so fierce that even the greatest warriors were afraid.  It was a truly scary and sad day.
