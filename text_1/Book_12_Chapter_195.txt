Once upon a time, the wise Bhishma told Arjuna, a brave warrior, about a special kind of thinking called yoga.  He said that amazing people, called Rishis, used yoga to become super peaceful and happy.

Bhishma explained that these Rishis were so good at yoga, they never had to be born again!  They didn't worry about things like being hot or cold, happy or sad. They lived simply, far away from their families and friends, so nothing could bother them.

To do yoga, Bhishma said, you need to be super still, like a piece of wood. You shouldn’t hear sounds, see things, smell things, taste things, or feel things.  Your mind should focus only on one thing.

But it's hard!  Bhishma said your mind is like a drop of water on a leaf, bouncing all over the place.  Sometimes it will focus, but then zoom off again, like the wind.  Don't give up!  Keep trying.  Be patient, like someone slowly watering dry dirt until it's all wet.  Keep focusing your mind, even when it feels hard.

Bhishma said that if you keep practicing yoga, you’ll get better at controlling your mind and body.  You’ll become wise and peaceful.  It’s much better than anything you could get from luck or hard work.  By doing yoga, you can find true happiness, a special peace called Nirvana.
