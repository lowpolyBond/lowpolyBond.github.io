King Sivi was a very, very good king.  He was the son of King Usinara, and he was super strong and brave! He ruled over a huge kingdom, so big that his chariot's wheels made the whole earth rumble!  He always fought for what was right and defeated all his enemies.

King Sivi loved to give things away. He gave away tons of gold, elephants, horses, and all sorts of animals!  He gave away so much food, it was like a giant feast for everyone. He even gave away land! He gave away so many cows, you couldn't count them â€“ more than raindrops, more than stars in the sky, more than grains of sand on the beach!

His gifts were so amazing, he had rivers of drinks and mountains of food at his big parties for the wise people called Brahmins. He told everyone, "Eat, drink, and bathe as much as you like!"  He was so kind and generous.  A powerful god, Rudra, was so happy with King Sivi, he gave him a special gift:  His kindness, his fame, and everything good about him would never run out!

Even though King Sivi was so wonderful and gave away everything he had, he still died and went to heaven.  So remember, even the greatest kings have to leave this world one day.  It's important to be kind and generous like King Sivi, even if we can't give away as much as he did.
