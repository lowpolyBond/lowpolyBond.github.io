King Dhritarashtra was worried.  He heard amazing stories about Arjuna, the son of Kunti.  Arjuna was super strong and brave! He had even been to Indra's home in heaven!

Dhritarashtra talked to his charioteer, Sanjaya.  "Sanjaya," he said, "Did you hear about Arjuna's amazing feats? My sons are planning something bad. They are mean, and they will hurt many people.  Arjuna is so powerful, anyone who fights him will lose!  Even the gods might not be able to stop him!

"My sons will have to fight Arjuna, and I'm scared for them.  Even our best warriors, like Bhishma, Drona, and Karna, might not win.  Karna is nice but forgetful. Drona is getting old. But Arjuna... Arjuna is angry, strong, and never gives up. He's unbeatable!

"They're all great warriors, and none of them want to lose.  It looks like a terrible battle will happen, and it might only end when someone is killed.  Arjuna is like a wildfire, burning everything in his path! His arrows are like lightning, and nothing can stop him.  He's like the sun, his arrows burning everything, and my sons will be scorched.  They are already scared just thinking about the noise of his chariot wheels!  It seems Vidhatri (the creator) made Arjuna to destroy everything!"

Dhritarashtra sighed, "Who can defeat Arjuna?  I am very, very worried."
