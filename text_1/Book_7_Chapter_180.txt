Sanjaya said, "The Pandavas were very sad.  Ghatotkacha, Hidimba's son, was dead.  They cried a lot.  But Krishna, he was happy! He shouted and hugged Arjuna. He danced and clapped.  Arjuna was confused.  He asked Krishna, 'Why are you so happy when we are so sad?  Our army is scared, and Ghatotkacha is gone!'

Krishna said, "Arjuna, I'm happy because Karna is almost beaten! Karna was super strong.  He was like a god in battle.  But a long time ago, a god took away Karna's special armor and earrings.  Because of that, Karna’s magical spear didn’t work as well. Ghatotkacha's death weakened Karna's power. Now Karna is much weaker.

"Before, Karna was so strong, nobody could defeat him! Not even the strongest gods!  He could have beaten you and me easily. But without his armor and earrings, he's much weaker.  He’s like a snake that’s been charmed or a fire that's lost its heat.

"You, Arjuna, are the only one who can kill him now!  I'll give you a sign when the time is right. When Karna's chariot wheels sink into the ground, that's your chance. Only then can you defeat him.  I had to help you by making sure he didn't have his special powers anymore."

Krishna explained that he had helped the Pandavas before by getting rid of other strong enemies like Jarasandha, the king of the Chedis, Ekalavya, and other powerful giants.  He said he'd done this to help Arjuna win the war.  Ghatotkacha was another strong enemy he helped defeat to make the path to Karna easier for Arjuna.
