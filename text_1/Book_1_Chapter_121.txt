Once upon a time, Queen Kunti talked to her husband, King Pandu.  She said, "My dear husband, I want to have children with you.  I will only ever love you, and I want to go to heaven with you someday."

Kunti then told King Pandu a story.  "Long ago," she said, "there was a great king named Vyushitaswa. He was strong and good. He won many battles and gave lots of presents to everyone.  He had a beautiful wife named Bhadra."

King Vyushitaswa loved Bhadra very much. But he worked too hard and got very sick. Sadly, he died.  Bhadra was so heartbroken because she had no children. She cried and cried, saying, "Life is no good without my husband! I want to die too!"

Then, a magical voice spoke to Bhadra.  The voice said, "Don't be sad, Bhadra. I will help you have children." The voice told Bhadra what to do, and she had seven children!

Kunti finished her story and said to King Pandu, "Just like King Vyushitaswa, you have magic too.  Please, let's have children together!"  King Pandu listened to his wife, and they were very happy.
