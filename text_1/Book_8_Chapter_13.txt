A great battle raged!  Karna, a powerful warrior, shot many arrows at the Pandavas’ army.  The Pandavas, angry, shot back! Karna’s arrows were bright, like the sun.  He even made the elephants cry out in fear!

Nakula zoomed towards Karna. Bhima fought Drona’s son. Satyaki fought the Kaikaya princes, Vinda and Anuvinda.  Many other warriors fought bravely too.  Yudhishthira fought Duryodhana, and Arjuna fought the Samsaptakas.

Satyaki was a very brave warrior. Vinda and Anuvinda shot many arrows at him. They hit him hard, but Satyaki didn’t give up! He smiled and shot back even more arrows.  He broke their bows!

Vinda and Anuvinda got new bows and shot again.  It was like a dark storm of arrows! They broke each other's bows!  Then, Satyaki, furious, shot Anuvinda.  Anuvinda’s head fell to the ground, making the Kaikayas very sad.

Vinda got angry. He shot lots of arrows at Satyaki. Satyaki was hurt, but he still fought bravely, shining like a bright flower. He shot back at Vinda!

They broke each other’s bows again. Then they fought with swords!  They were so strong! They circled each other, hitting and blocking. Satyaki cut Vinda’s shield, and Vinda cut Satyaki’s. Then, Satyaki was very quick. He swung his sword and cut Vinda in half! Vinda fell down like a big mountain!

Satyaki jumped onto another chariot and kept fighting, and the remaining Kaikayas ran away! The battle was fierce, but Satyaki was a winner!
