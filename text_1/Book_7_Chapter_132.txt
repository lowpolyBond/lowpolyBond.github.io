King Dhritarashtra was worried.  He asked Sanjaya, his advisor, "Bhima, the Pandava warrior, beat Karna in battle!  Karna is super strong, he can even fight gods and demons! Why did he lose to Bhima?"

Dhritarashtra was sad.  He thought his son Duryodhana was making bad choices. Duryodhana kept trying to defeat the Pandavas with Karna’s help, but Karna kept losing to Bhima.  Dhritarashtra feared the Kauravas, his own sons, would be defeated because of this.  He said, "The Pandavas are almost impossible to beat, even gods can't defeat them! Duryodhana doesn’t understand this." He was upset because Duryodhana was mean to the Pandavas and took their things.

Dhritarashtra wanted to know all about the fight between Bhima and Karna.  He asked, "Tell me everything! How did this great battle go? It was a fight to the death!"

Sanjaya said, "It was like two angry elephants fighting in the forest! Karna shot thirty arrows at Bhima.  Bhima was strong too! He broke Karna’s bow with three arrows. Then, Bhima knocked Karna’s driver off his chariot!

Karna threw a super-powerful spear at Bhima, like a thunderbolt! But Bhima was quick! He cut the spear in mid-air with seven arrows!  They kept shooting arrows at each other, roaring like angry bulls or tigers.  Sometimes they laughed, sometimes they shouted, sometimes they blew their horns.

Then Bhima broke Karna’s bow again! He killed Karna's horses and driver! Karna was in trouble; he had no horses or driver, and arrows were raining down on him!

Duryodhana panicked! He told his brother Durjaya, "Go help Karna! Bhima is about to defeat him!"

Durjaya attacked Bhima, but Bhima quickly defeated him!  Then, Bhima kept shooting arrows at Karna, making him look like a porcupine covered in spikes!

Even though Karna was covered in arrows, he was still fighting! He was a very brave warrior!"
