King Dhritarashtra was talking to his advisor, Sanjaya.  He said, "Look at our army! It's HUGE!  We have so many soldiers!  They are strong and brave. They are all different sizes, but they are all ready to fight.

They are the best fighters!  They're not too old, not too young. They're healthy and strong. They have amazing weapons: swords, spears, and even big clubs! They know how to fight on elephants and horses and in chariots.  They've practiced a lot!

We paid them well to fight for us, not because they are our family or friends. They are good people. We've been kind to their families.  Our army is led by amazing heroes like Bhishma, Drona, and Kripa. They are super strong and brave warriors!  They’re like the best heroes in the whole world!  Even more soldiers joined us to help!

Our army is like a huge ocean!  The soldiers are like the water, the horses and elephants are like the waves, and the weapons are like the oars!  It's so big and powerful!

But, Sanjaya," Dhritarashtra sighed, "even with this amazing army, I think we might lose. Maybe it was decided long ago that this would happen.  Maybe it’s destiny.  My wise advisor, Vidura, warned me, but my son Duryodhana didn't listen. Everything seems to be decided already.  It’s all part of a bigger plan."
