Once upon a time, in a land far away, a good king named Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, a very important question.  "Grandpa," he said, "what should a priest do when bad things happen?  When bad people take everything, and there's no food or money left, how can a priest feed his family?"

Bhishma, the wise old man, smiled. "My dear Yudhishthira," he said, "a priest should use his knowledge and wisdom. Good things happen to good people.  If he sees a bad person with something that would help good people, he can take it and give it to someone who needs it."

Bhishma explained how a king should rule during hard times.  "A king shouldn't make his people angry," he said. "He can take things that aren't freely given, but he must be fair.  He should never hurt good people, like priests and teachers. That's very wrong!"

Bhishma said the king shouldn't believe everything he hears. "People sometimes tell lies and gossip," he said. "A good king doesn't punish anyone based on gossip. He listens to the truth."

Bhishma said a good king is like a strong ox, pulling a heavy cart.  He works hard even when things are difficult.  He tries to make friends to help him through the hard times.  He follows the old, good rules, but he also uses his own good judgment.

"A king should never cheat or steal to get rich," Bhishma said.  "He should always be honest and fair.  It's hard to know what's always right, like trying to find the legs of a snake," he chuckled.  "But, like following blood drops to find a hurt deer, a king should look for clues to what is right.  He should follow the path of good people."  

"That," Bhishma concluded, "is how a good king, and indeed any good person, should act in difficult times."
