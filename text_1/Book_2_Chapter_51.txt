Guha, a kind forest man, saw Lakshmana guarding his brother Rama.  "Friend," Guha said, "rest!  You're used to comfort. We'll watch over Rama.  He's the most important person to me." Guha promised to protect Rama, even from strong enemies. He knew the forest well.

Lakshmana said, "I trust you, but how can I leave Rama?  He's a prince, and he's sleeping on the ground! I can't rest."

Lakshmana was sad. He thought about his father, King Dasaratha.  He knew his father would be heartbroken without Rama.  Lakshmana worried his mother and his father's other queen, Kaushalya, would be very sad and might even get sick. He pictured Ayodhya, their beautiful city, becoming sad and empty without Rama.  He missed his home, with its beautiful palaces and happy people.

Lakshmana felt very bad.  He kept watch over Rama all night, thinking of his family.  He told Guha how sad he was, and Guha felt sad too.  They both cried.
