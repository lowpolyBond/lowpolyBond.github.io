Once upon a time, a wise man named Bharadwaja asked another wise man, Bhrigu, some important questions.  He wanted to know what happened when people did good things.

Bharadwaja asked: "What happens if I give gifts? What if I'm good and kind? What if I pray and meditate? What if I study holy books? What happens if I offer prayers to the fire?"

Bhrigu answered: "Giving gifts makes you happy and gives you nice things. Praying and meditating helps you go to a wonderful place after you die.  Being good and kind makes you feel peaceful. Studying holy books makes you wise. Offering prayers to the fire cleanses you of bad things." He explained that gifts could be for now or later.  Good gifts help you in the afterlife!

Bharadwaja asked another question: "What are the right things to do in life?  How many ways are there to live a good life?"

Bhrigu said: "Wise people who do what's right go to heaven. If you don't do what's right, you make mistakes."

Bharadwaja then asked about the four ways people can live their lives.

Bhrigu explained: "A long time ago, a great being showed us four ways to live. The first is to live with a teacher.  You must be clean, pray, be humble, and always respect your teacher. You should study holy books and help your teacher. You should live simply and share everything you get."

"The second way is to have a family and a home. This is where you can be good, rich, and happy. You can earn money in good ways, help your family, and make offerings."

"The third way is to live in the forest and study the holy books. You travel and help others, sharing food and a kind word with everyone you meet. It's important to treat guests very well, because if you don't, they take away your good luck!"

"The fourth way is to live the life of a holy person after your family life. They focus on prayer and good deeds."

Bhrigu added, "Even a simple farmer who works hard and is kind can go to heaven.  Being good is always the best way to live!"
