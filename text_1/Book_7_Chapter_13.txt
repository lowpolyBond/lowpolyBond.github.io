Once upon a time, in a great battle, the wicked Duryodhana wanted to capture Yudhishthira, the good king.  He made a deal with Drona, a powerful warrior. Drona promised to capture Yudhishthira, but only if he could trick him.

Yudhishthira's spies heard about the plan.  He told his brother Arjuna, the greatest warrior of all.  "Arjuna," said Yudhishthira, "Drona wants to capture me! We must stop him!"

Arjuna was brave, but he loved his teacher, Drona. "I can't fight my teacher," he said. "I would rather die than fight Drona.  But don't worry, King Yudhishthira, I won't let Drona capture you!"

Then, the battle began!  Horns blew, drums beat, and arrows flew everywhere.  The Pandavas, Yudhishthira's army, fought hard.  Drona was very strong, and he fought like a sun with a hundred bright rays!  He was so powerful that the Pandavas couldn't even look at him.  

He shot so many arrows, they flew everywhere, making the Pandavas' army scared. Drona attacked Dhrishtadyumna's soldiers, pushing back their lines. He was like a storm, destroying everything in his path. The Pandavas and their allies struggled, but Drona was too strong.  It looked like Duryodhana might win.
