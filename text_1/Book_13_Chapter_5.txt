King Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandpa, tell me about being kind and what makes someone good."

Bhishma said, "I'll tell you a story about a wonderful parrot named Suka.  In a big forest, a hunter shot a poisoned arrow.  He missed his target, an antelope, and hit a tree instead! The tree got sick and started to die.  All its leaves fell off.

Suka, the parrot, lived in a hole in that tree.  He loved his tree very much.  Even though the tree was dying, Suka stayed there. He didn't want to leave his home. He stayed put, even without food.  He was very sad.

Indra, the king of the gods, saw Suka.  He was amazed by the parrot’s kindness.  He wondered why such a small bird would be so loyal to a dying tree. He changed himself into a wise-looking man and talked to Suka.

Indra asked Suka, “Little bird, why don’t you leave this sick tree? There are many other nice trees in the forest.”

Suka answered, "Great god, I was born in this tree.  This tree protected me when I was little.  I can’t leave it now, even though it is sick.  Being kind is very important to me."

Indra was very happy to hear this. He said, "Suka, you are a very good and kind bird. Ask me for anything you want!"

Suka said, "Please, make my tree healthy again."

Indra was so pleased with Suka's kindness that he sprinkled magical nectar on the tree.  The tree became strong and healthy again!  Suka lived happily in his tree until the end of his life.  Because of his kindness, Suka even became friends with Indra!

Bhishma finished the story, "So, Yudhishthira, being kind is very important. It brings happiness to you and to others."
