The Pandava brothers were hiding.  They needed jobs to survive.  Yudhishthira, the oldest brother, asked Nakula, "Nakula, what job will you do?"

Nakula smiled. "I'll be a horse keeper for King Virata! I know all about horses.  I'm good at training them.  I'll call myself Granthika. Nobody will know it's me!"

Then Yudhishthira asked Sahadeva, "And you, Sahadeva, what will you do?"

Sahadeva said, "I'll be a cow keeper! I'm great with cows.  I know how to milk them and take care of them.  I'll be called Tantripal.  It'll be easy to hide."

Finally, Yudhishthira turned to Draupadi, their brave wife.  "My dear Draupadi, you've always lived in a palace. What will you do?"

Draupadi said, "I'll be a hair dresser for Queen Sudeshna!  I'll be called a Sairindhri.  I'll say I used to work for you, Yudhishthira.  It's the best way to hide."

Yudhishthira worried about Draupadi.  She was a princess! He said, "My dear Draupadi, be careful.  Make sure you stay safe."

Draupadi promised to be careful.  She knew she had to be clever to protect herself and her family.  The Pandavas were ready for their secret lives in King Virata's palace.
