Long ago, a wise man named Manu told a story about our inner selves. He said, imagine your body sleeping. It's still there, but your spirit, a tiny spark, leaves for a while, like going on a little adventure.  

When we're awake, our senses – seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and touching – help us see the world.  It's like looking at pictures in a clear pond. But if the water is muddy, you can't see the pictures. If our senses are confused, we can't see our true selves.

Bad thoughts and actions are like muddying the water. They make us unhappy and keep us stuck. We want things we shouldn't, and we never feel truly satisfied. It's like being thirsty but never finding water.  To get rid of that thirst, we need to be good.

Being good helps us see our true selves, like seeing our faces in a clear mirror.  It’s like the sun shining; we feel happy and peaceful. Our mind is like a bird, above our senses.  Above our mind is our understanding, then our soul, and finally, something even bigger and more powerful – the Supreme Being.

Our soul is like the sun. It sends its light, our senses, out into the world. When we sleep, the light comes back.  Our actions create a path we follow again and again.  If we want good things, we need to do good things.

If we stop wanting things we don't need and focus on our soul, our minds become calm. We can then reach something amazing called Brahma – it's a place of peace beyond our senses. We can't see, hear, or touch it, but we can understand it.

Our senses lead to our mind, our mind to our understanding, our understanding to our soul, and our soul to the Supreme Being.  It's a journey inward. Our true self, our soul, is amazing, and it can see everything.
