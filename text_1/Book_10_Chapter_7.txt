Ashwatthama, Drona's brave son, was in trouble.  He bowed his head and prayed to the great god Shiva. He called Shiva by many names – Ugra, Sthanu, Rudra, and many more. He asked Shiva for help, saying he was weak and needed protection.  He said, "I offer myself to you!"

Suddenly, a shiny golden altar appeared!  A huge fire blazed on it.  Amazing creatures appeared too! They looked like animals – elephants, horses, tigers, even birds and snakes! Some had many heads, arms, and legs. Some were big, some small. Some were shiny, some scary!  They made lots of noise, banging drums and cymbals.  They were Shiva's friends.

Ashwatthama wasn't scared. He knew he needed to make a sacrifice. He made the altar a place for his offering. He used his bow and arrows as tools, and gave his own spirit to the fire. He prayed to Shiva, saying, “I give myself to you because I am weak. Please help me!”

Then, Shiva himself appeared! He smiled and said, "I've been helping Krishna, so I'm helping his friends too."  Shiva gave Ashwatthama a strong, magical sword.  Ashwatthama became super strong and powerful.  Invisible helpers surrounded him, ready to fight!  He was ready to face his enemies.
