Once upon a time, on a huge battlefield, two armies were ready to fight.  After they set up their camps, Drona, a very smart warrior on the Kaurava side, felt sad.  He went to Duryodhana and said, "I told you before, Arjuna is impossible to defeat!  He's too strong, even the gods couldn't capture him!  Arjuna, with his friend Krishna, is unbeatable!"

Drona had a plan. "If we can trick Arjuna away," he said, "we can easily capture Yudhishthira, the Pandava king! Someone needs to challenge Arjuna to a fight and lure him away. Arjuna will fight them, and in that time, I'll grab Yudhishthira!"

Five brothers, the Trigartas, heard Drona.  They were angry because Arjuna had always beaten them in the past.  They promised Duryodhana, "We will fight Arjuna!  Either Arjuna will be gone, or we will be!"  Many more soldiers joined them, making a huge army. They even made a special promise to the gods, swearing that if they didn’t defeat Arjuna, bad things would happen to them.  They were ready to fight to the death!

They challenged Arjuna, who told Yudhishthira, "I'm going to fight them!  They’re already defeated in my eyes!" Yudhishthira, worried about what Drona would do, told Arjuna, "Arjuna,  Drona wants to capture me! Be careful, he’s very strong!"  Arjuna then said, "Don't worry, as long as Satyajit is alive, Drona can't do anything. But if Satyajit dies, you need to leave the battlefield quickly!"

Yudhishthira let Arjuna go. He hugged him and wished him good luck. Arjuna went to fight the Trigartas, like a lion hunting deer! Duryodhana's army was very happy because Arjuna was gone.  They rushed towards Yudhishthira’s army, ready for a huge battle!  It was like two giant rivers crashing together!
