Long ago, in the land of Bharat, a wise man named Bhrigu explained something very important: Truth is like the sun!  It makes everything grow.  Truth helps us be good and go to a happy place called Heaven after we die.  Untruth is like darkness, making things scary and sad.  It leads to a place called Hell.  

Bhrigu said that being good and truthful brings happiness.  Being bad and untrue brings sadness.  Happiness is like sunshine, and sadness is like a dark rainy day.  This happiness is important – it's a good feeling inside and a good life.

Another wise man, Bharadwaja, disagreed.  He said, “Wait a minute!  Very holy people don't always look for happiness.  They focus on being good and helping others.”  He mentioned a powerful god who didn't even care about happiness!

Bhrigu explained again.  He said, "Darkness, which comes from being untrue, brings bad things.  It makes people angry, greedy, and mean.  These bad feelings cause sickness, sadness, and all sorts of trouble.  Heaven is wonderful – there's no pain or suffering there!"  He said that happiness is the best thing we can get, even though it’s not always easy to find in our world.

Bhrigu talked about how people create their own happiness or sadness through their actions.  Like a plant needs sun and water to grow, we need to be good and truthful to be happy.  It's like a secret code: good actions = happiness; bad actions = sadness.  That's the way the world works.
