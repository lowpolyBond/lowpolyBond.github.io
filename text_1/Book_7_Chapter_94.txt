Once upon a time, in a great battle, Duryodhana, a strong warrior, followed Arjuna and another hero deep into the enemy's army.  The Pandavas, with their friends, shouted loudly and attacked Drona's soldiers.

A HUGE battle started! It was so scary, it made everyone's hair stand on end.  The sun was high in the sky.  It was the biggest battle anyone had ever seen!

Dhrishtadyumna led the Pandavas.  They rained arrows down on Drona's army.  Drona's army fought back, shooting arrows at the Pandavas.  Both armies were huge, like giant clouds crashing together in a storm.

The Pandavas, like a rushing river, tried to break through Drona's army, but Drona was strong, like a big mountain that couldn't be moved.  Many other kings fought too.  Dhrishtadyumna and Drona fought each other, raining arrows.  It was like a terrible storm!

Drona's army broke into three parts. One ran to Kritavarman, another to Jalasandha, and the last fought Dhrishtadyumna.  The Pandavas kept winning, and it seemed like death itself was taking the Kaurava warriors.  It was like a bad king's land being destroyed by hunger, sickness, and thieves.  The sun and the dust made it hard for everyone to see.

Drona got angry and fought back fiercely, like a big fire. He could kill many with just one arrow.  No one in the Pandava army could stand up to him!  The sun and Drona's arrows made the Pandava army struggle.

But the Pandavas fought hard too.  Bhima fought against many warriors.  Many heroes fought brave battles.   Yudhishthira fought bravely.  Satyaki fought against Duhsasana.  Many more heroes fought bravely on both sides.  No one ran away!

The king of Sindhu was protected by many strong warriors, including Kripa and Karna.  They guarded him from all sides, and the battle raged on.
