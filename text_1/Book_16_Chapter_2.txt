Long ago, in the land of the Yadavas, a scary time was coming.  Death, a scary, bald, dark man, walked among them every day!  The brave Yadava warriors shot arrows at him, but they couldn't hurt him. He was too powerful.

Strange things happened.  Strong winds blew.  Rats and mice ran everywhere, even nibbling people's hair and nails in their sleep!  Birds sang strange songs, and animals made scary sounds.  Weird babies were born – donkeys from cows, elephants from mules!  It was very, very strange.

The Yadavas were not kind. They didn't respect their elders or the gods.  Only two brothers, Rama and Krishna, were good.  Fires burned strangely, sometimes blue and red.  The sun looked spooky.  Worms appeared in perfectly good food.  They heard scary footsteps, but no one was there!  The stars and planets seemed to crash into each other.

One day, Krishna, who is also called Hrishikesa, noticed that the moon was doing something very unusual – the lunar calendar seemed to be wrong.  He remembered the words of a sad queen, Gandhari, who had lost her sons. She had predicted something terrible would happen. Krishna knew it was time.

Krishna saw that all these strange things meant that something very bad was about to happen. He said, "This is like the time before a big war!"

To try to stop this bad thing, Krishna told everyone they must go to the ocean and bathe in its sacred water.  He wanted to save them.  He hoped a trip to the ocean would help.  The message was sent to everyone: "Go to the sea!"
