King Yudhishthira asked, "How can someone become truly peaceful and happy, like a powerful, unchanging god?"

His wise grandfather, Bhishma, said, "By living a simple life!  Someone who eats just enough, controls their feelings, and always does what's right can be truly happy.  Let me tell you a story about a very wise man named Jaigishavya."

Bhishma told a story about a wise man, Jaigishavya, who was asked by a holy man, Devala: "You never get upset when people criticize you, and you never get too excited when they praise you.  Where did you learn to be so calm?"

Jaigishavya answered, "Being truly wise means treating everyone the same, whether they're nice or mean.  Wise people don't brag about good things they do. They don't get angry or try to get even when someone is unkind. They don't worry about the past or future, only about doing the right thing *now*. They don't get jealous of others' success. They don't care about praise or criticism; it doesn't change them. They're kind to everyone and always peaceful. They don't have best friends or worst enemies. They are just happy being themselves.

Following the rules of good behavior brings happiness. Ignoring those rules brings sadness. I follow the rules, so I'm happy. Whether people are nice or mean to me doesn't bother me.  I don't want anything from anyone. Praise or insults are the same to me; they don't matter.  A wise person doesn't need things; they are already content.  A wise person is fearless. Even if someone is unkind to them, that person will suffer more.  By living this way, you can achieve the greatest peace and happiness, even better than the gods!"
