King Vasumana had a wise advisor named Vamadeva.  Vamadeva told the king, "Winning without fighting is best!  The wisest kings don't brag about battles.  Before you try to take over new lands, make sure your kingdom is strong."

"A strong kingdom has lots of wealth," Vamadeva explained. "Happy people, lots of helpers, and a happy army.  An army that's paid well and is clever can win big even if it's small!  A king whose people are kind and have enough food is really powerful."

"Only when you're much stronger than your enemy should you try to take their land," Vamadeva said. "A great king is kind to everyone, doesn't waste time, and protects himself.  But a king who is mean to his own people is like cutting down his own forest â€“ he hurts himself!  If you don't fight your enemies, they won't go away.  But if you control your anger, you'll have fewer enemies!"

"A wise king does only good things," Vamadeva continued. "He does things that help him and everyone else.  If a king does what's right, he feels good inside and won't have any regrets.  He'll win in this world and the next!"

Bhishma, a very important warrior, added, "King Vasumana listened to Vamadeva and did what he said.  You should too!  If you follow this advice, you will win everything!"
