Once upon a time, there was a very handsome and strong king named Nala.  He was a great king, loved by everyone, and was even better at archery than anyone else.  Far away, in another kingdom, lived King Bhima. He was a good king, but he and his queen had no children.  They wished for a child very much.

One day, a wise holy man visited King Bhima. The holy man was so happy to be welcomed that he gave the king and queen a wonderful gift: a beautiful daughter named Damayanti, and three strong sons.  Damayanti grew up to be the most beautiful girl in the whole world! Everyone admired her.  She was more beautiful than anyone, even the gods and goddesses!

Now, King Nala was also known for his amazing beauty. Everyone talked about how handsome he was.  People told stories about both Nala and Damayanti, and soon, they heard of each other. They both became very interested in each other, even though they had never met!

One day, King Nala caught a swan with golden wings. The swan, who could talk, promised to tell Damayanti about King Nala. The swan flew to Damayanti's kingdom and told her how handsome and wonderful King Nala was. The swan also told King Nala about Damayantiâ€™s beauty.

The swan said that Damayanti and Nala were perfect for each other, and that they should get married!  The swan flew back to King Nala, and told him everything Damayanti had said.  Both Nala and Damayanti knew they wanted to meet! And so, the story of their love begins...
