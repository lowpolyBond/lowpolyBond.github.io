Garuda, a giant bird, was carrying a huge elephant and a big turtle in his claws.  He was flying very high!  Suddenly, he bumped into a tree branch.  Hanging upside down from the branch were tiny, magical people called the Valakhilya Rishis. They were praying.

Garuda was worried the branch would fall and hurt them.  He was very strong, so he held onto the elephant and turtle tightly, and carefully used his beak to hold up the branch. The Rishis were amazed! They were so impressed by his strength and kindness that they gave him his name: Garuda, which means "the one who carries heavy things."

Garuda flew and flew, looking for a place to put down the branch, elephant, and turtle.  He finally found his father, Kasyapa, who was praying on a mountain. Kasyapa saw Garuda and worried.  "My son," he said, "those tiny Rishis are very powerful. If they get angry, they could hurt you!"

Kasyapa talked to the Rishis. He explained that Garuda was trying to help everyone. The Rishis agreed to let go of the branch. Garuda then asked his father where he could put the branch safely. Kasyapa told him about a snowy mountain far away, where no one lived.

Garuda flew to that mountain super fast.  He dropped the branch with a huge BOOM! The mountain shook, and flowers rained down.  Then, Garuda ate the elephant and the turtle.

Suddenly, strange things started happening in the sky!  The gods' weapons started fighting each other!  Meteors flew down, and the sky roared.  Even Indra, the king of the gods, was scared.

Vrihaspati, a wise god, explained what was happening.  Garuda was so strong, he was going to try to steal the gods' special drink, the Amrita!  The gods got scared and prepared to fight Garuda to protect their drink. They put on their best armor and got out their strongest weapons. They were ready for a big battle!
