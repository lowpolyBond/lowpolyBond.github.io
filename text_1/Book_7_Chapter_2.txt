Once upon a time, during a great war, a brave warrior named Bhishma died.  His friend, Karna, was very sad.  Bhishma was like a father to Karna's army.  The army was in big trouble, like a boat sinking in the deep ocean.

Karna rushed to help. He was a strong warrior, and everyone respected him.  He told his soldiers, "Bhishma was a good man. He was strong, smart, and kind. Now that he's gone, we must be brave. Everything in this world ends.  Even the sun will rise again tomorrow, but Bhishma won't. Let's not give up!"

Karna’s words made the soldiers cry. But then, the battle started again!  Karna shouted, "This world is like a passing cloud.  Even mighty Bhishma fell. But we won’t be defeated! We'll fight bravely!"

Karna knew the enemy was very strong.  The Pandavas had mighty warriors like Arjuna, Bhima, and the twins.  But Karna wasn’t scared. He said, “We’ll fight with all our might! I will protect our army, even if it means I have to die trying!"

Karna asked his driver to get his best chariot. It was shiny and golden, with strong horses.  He put on his best armor and grabbed his sharpest weapons.  He was ready to fight.

He roared, "I will defeat the Pandavas! Or I will die trying. I will either win the war for Duryodhana, or join Bhishma in the next world!" Then, with his golden chariot shining brightly like the sun, Karna went to fight. He was ready to give his all for his friends.
