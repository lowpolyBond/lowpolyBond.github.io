King Yudhishthira asked his grandpa Bhishma, "Grandpa, what's the most important thing â€“ family, good deeds, riches, or wisdom?"

Bhishma smiled.  "Wisdom is the best thing, my boy! It's better than anything!  Even people who lost everything found happiness again because they were wise.  Let me tell you a story!"

Once, a rich man accidentally hurt a holy man named Kasyapa.  Kasyapa was so sad and angry he wanted to die.  He lay on the ground, ready to give up.

Suddenly, a jackal appeared!  It was actually Indra, the king of the gods, in disguise.  Indra said, "Kasyapa, you're a human, a holy man, someone who knows the sacred books!  You're lucky! Many creatures want to be human, but you have so much already. Don't be foolish and give up!"

Indra explained, "Look at me! I'm a jackal. I can't even scratch myself!  People with hands can do so much: build houses, eat good food,  help animals, and lots more! You have hands, Kasyapa. Be happy for what you have."

Indra went on, "People always want more. Rich people want to be kings, kings want to be gods, and even gods want more! It never ends.  Happiness isn't about getting more things. It's about being content."

Indra told Kasyapa to study the holy books, be kind, and live a good life. He told him that being good, not having lots of things, brings real happiness.

Kasyapa realized Indra was right. He stood up, happy to be alive.  He saw that the jackal was actually Indra!  He bowed down and thanked the great god. Then he went home.

Bhishma finished, "So, Yudhishthira, wisdom is the greatest treasure. It brings true happiness."
