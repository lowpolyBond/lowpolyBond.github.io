Long ago, in a land far away, a wise king named Mandhatri wanted to see a very powerful god, Vishnu.  He was a great king, but he wanted to understand his duties better.

He asked Bhishma, a very old and wise man, about what a king should do. Bhishma explained that a king's job is the most important!  All the other jobs, like being a priest or a hermit, were also important, but they all depended on the king keeping everyone safe and happy.

Bhishma said that being a king was like being a superhero.  Kings protect everyone, like a parent protects their children.  They stop bad people from hurting others, and they make sure everyone can live peacefully.

Mandhatri went to see the powerful god Indra, who was like a super-god!  Mandhatri asked Indra how to be the best king.

Indra told Mandhatri that being a king was more than just fighting battles.  It was about being brave, kind, and smart. It was about knowing the right thing to do and doing it, even if it was hard.

Indra explained that long ago, Vishnu, the greatest god, had saved the world by fighting bad guys.  If Vishnu hadnâ€™t done this, everyone would have been in trouble!  Kingly duties, Indra said, were the most important because they protected everyone else.

Indra said that being a good king meant helping everyone, keeping peace, and always trying to do what was right. It meant being brave, but also kind. He also said being a king protected all other types of people and jobs.

Mandhatri understood. He learned that being a good king was about being a hero for everyone, a protector of the people, and a follower of what is right. And that's a very important job!
