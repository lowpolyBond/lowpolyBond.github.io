Sanjaya said, "Karna, the brave son of Radha, spoke to Shalya, the king.  He said, 'Shalya, your mean words can't scare me! Even if all the gods fought me, I wouldn't be afraid!  So your words don't bother me at all.  You're wasting your time trying to frighten *me*!'

Karna continued, 'You're just being mean because you're weak.  Instead of talking about my skills, you just say nasty things. But I, Karna, was born to be brave and win glory! I only let you live because we're friends and allies.  King Dhritarashtra needs me to fight, and that's why you're still alive, Shalya.  We even made a deal: I would forgive any rude things you said. That's your only reason for being alive right now. I could defeat all my enemies without even needing a thousand soldiers like you! Hurting a friend is wrong. That's why I'm letting you live, for now.'"
