Bhima, the strongest Pandava brother, got a message.  His brothers, Arjuna and Satyaki, were in trouble!  He knew a super-fast chariot, the kind even gods used, was waiting. "I'll go!" he said. "Don't worry!"

He told his friend Dhrishtadyumna, "You must keep Yudhishthira, our king, safe.  Drona, the enemy, wants to capture him!  I have to go help Arjuna, but I'll be back!"

Before he left, Yudhishthira hugged Bhima and wished him luck. Bhima did some special good-luck things. He visited holy men, touched lucky objects, and even had some delicious honey.  He felt super strong!

Just as he was about to go,  Arjuna's conch shell, Panchajanya, blew a HUGE, scary sound!  Yudhishthira worried. "Arjuna's in big trouble!" he cried. "Go quickly, Bhima!"

Bhima roared like a lion, blew his own conch, and zoomed off in his chariot.  His horses were super fast!  He smashed into the enemy army!

Lots of enemy warriors attacked Bhima.  He fought bravely, like a lion among smaller animals. He was showered with arrows but wasn't hurt.

He even fought Drona, their old teacher!  Drona was surprised Bhima wasnâ€™t bowing down to him like Arjuna.  Bhima said, "I'm not Arjuna. I'm Bhima, and you're my enemy today!"  He threw his mighty mace and smashed Drona's chariot!

Bhima killed many of the enemy's soldiers, including some of the king's sons. He was so strong, the enemy army ran away in fear.  Bhima roared with victory and went to find Drona again.  The enemy was scared of him!
