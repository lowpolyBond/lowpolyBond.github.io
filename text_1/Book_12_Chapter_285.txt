Once upon a time, in the land of Bharat, a wise king named Yudhishthira asked his grandfather, Bhishma, a very brave warrior,  "Grandpa, tell me the special names Daksha used to praise the great god!"

Bhishma smiled, "Listen, Yudhishthira! I'll tell you the secret and the known names of that amazing god!"

Bhishma then told Yudhishthira what Daksha had said:  "I bow to you, great god! You defeat the bad guys. You are strong.  Gods and demons worship you. You have a thousand eyes, fierce eyes, and three eyes! You are friends with the Yaksha king.  Your hands and feet are everywhere. Your eyes, head, mouth, and ears are everywhere too! You have big ears, like an elephant or a bull. You are as big as the ocean! You have a hundred stomachs, a hundred spins, and a hundred tongues! People who pray to the sun, or sing the Gayatri prayer, are praising you.  The wise people see you in everything –  as the sky, as the ocean, as Indra, and as Brahmana! You are Soma, Agni, the water god, Aditya, Vishnu, and Brahmana all at once! You are everything – creation and destruction!"

Daksha went on and on, listing many more names.  He called the god by names like Tryamvaka (three-eyed),  Chanda, Kunda, the one with the magic stick, the one who has ears everywhere. He described the god with lots of different features:  a blue throat, three heads, a trident, and even  upside-down hair and teeth!  He praised the god's many forms—scary, beautiful, powerful—saying that the god was the sun, the master of ghosts, the strongest warrior. Daksha said the god was made of gold, and he ate everything, and was everything!  He called the god the navel of the universe, and the giver of all wishes.

Daksha said so many wonderful things about the god! He called him Krisanasa, the cheerful one, the one who danced, and the one who played music. He called him the oldest, the strongest, the master of time, and the destroyer of evil.

Finally, Daksha finished his prayer: "You are everything, oh great one!  You are the beginning and the end.  You are all colors. You are Indra, Yama, Agni – all the gods!  You are the sun, the moon, the stars!  You are even sneezing and yawning!  You are the creator and the destroyer of everything!"

The great god, Mahadeva, heard Daksha's beautiful prayer. He was so happy that he stopped being angry. He said to Daksha, "You’ve made me very happy! You don’t need to praise me any more.  You'll be my friend. You'll get the good luck of a thousand sacrifices!  Don’t be sad!"

Mahadeva also gave Daksha a special gift, a powerful religion called Pasupata, which could bring him happiness and peace.  Then Mahadeva, his wife, and all his friends disappeared.

Bhishma told Yudhishthira that anyone who learns this prayer will be safe and have a long life.  It will help them with all their problems and even make them as powerful as Mahadeva’s friends!  It's a very special prayer.  Then, Bhishma told him that the great sage Vyasa had told this whole story.
