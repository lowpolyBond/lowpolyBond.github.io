Once upon a time, the Pandava brothers, led by their wise older brother Yudhishthira, were living in the forest.  Many wise Brahmins (holy men) followed them. Yudhishthira was worried.  He had no food to feed them! He asked his priest, Dhaumya, for help.

Dhaumya, a very smart and good man, thought hard. He told Yudhishthira a story: "Long ago, all the creatures on Earth were very hungry. The sun, like a kind father, felt sorry for them.  He moved around the Earth, bringing warmth and making water rise from the ground. The moon then made clouds from this water, and the clouds rained, making plants grow.  These plants became food for everyone! So, the sun is the father of all food.  You, Yudhishthira, should ask the sun for help!"

Dhaumya told Yudhishthira to pray to the sun.  He gave Yudhishthira 108 names for the sun to use in his prayer.  Some names were Surya, Ravi, and Vivaswan.

Yudhishthira went to the river, cleaned himself, and prayed to the sun. He said, “Oh sun, you are the light of the world! You give life to everything! You help everyone who is good. Please help me feed the Brahmins!” He praised the sun for a long, long time, telling it how important it was.  He talked about how it gave life to plants, light to the world, and even made the rain.

The sun, happy with the prayer, appeared before Yudhishthira! The sun said, “You will have all you need! I will give you enough food for seven years. Here is a special copper pot.  As long as your wife Draupadi keeps this pot, you will always have enough food!”

Yudhishthira was overjoyed! The food in the pot never ran out.  He and his brothers, and the Brahmins, ate their fill every day.  After fourteen years, the Pandavas would get their kingdom back.

Yudhishthira was very grateful. He continued to worship the sun and live happily with his brothers and the Brahmins in the forest, until it was time to return to their kingdom.
