King Janaka was confused.  He talked to a wise man named Vasishtha.  Janaka didn't understand about the soul. Some people think the soul is many things.  Wise people know the soul is one. Janaka asked Vasishtha to explain.

Vasishtha said, "I will!  Let's talk about Yoga." Yoga is like meditation.  It's about focusing your mind. It's also about controlling your breath.  You should practice Yoga most of the time, except when you eat or go to the bathroom.

To do Yoga, you close your eyes and quiet your mind. You focus on your breath.  You try to connect your soul with something bigger, something that's always there, even when your body is gone.  It's like becoming as still as a stone. You don't hear, smell, taste, see, or feel anything. You become like a quiet flame in the wind. When you do this, your soul becomes one with everything.

Vasishtha also talked about Sankhya. Sankhya is like a puzzle. The puzzle starts with something unseen, then things appear. First comes something big, then smaller parts, like sounds, shapes, tastes, and smells. There are more pieces to the puzzle, making the whole world. When the world ends, all the pieces go back to where they started.

Only the biggest, most important piece remains: the Supreme Soul.  The Supreme Soul is like the sun, bright and powerful. It’s in everyone and everything, but not everyone can see it. It’s the one that creates the whole world, and it's also everywhere.

Vasishtha explained that the soul is separate from all the puzzle pieces. The soul sees everything, but it's not part of the puzzle.  When you understand this, you become one with the Supreme Soul. Then you don't have to worry about coming back to Earth again. You will be happy and at peace.


People who don’t understand this, only see the puzzle pieces. They don’t see the big picture, and they will have to come back to Earth again and again. But those who understand the Supreme Soul, become wise and peaceful forever. They don't need to be born again.
