Once upon a time, during a great war, a huge battle raged!  The Kaurava army, with its many elephants, fought the Pandava army.  It was a terrible fight!

Soldiers fought with swords, spears, and arrows.  Brave warriors from both sides clashed, and many fell.  Elephants fought elephants, and horses fought horses.  Foot soldiers ran at each other, shouting and fighting bravely.  It was so chaotic, you could only tell who was who by their names!

The sun set, making it hard to see.  But Duryodhana, the Kaurava prince, was angry. He wanted revenge, so he bravely charged into the Pandava army.  He was like a blazing sun, shooting arrows everywhere!

The Pandavas couldn't even look at him.  Duryodhana's arrows were like fire!  Many Pandavas fell.  The Pandavas were losing badly. It was like a field of flowers being dried up by the sun!  Many soldiers were hurt - even great warriors like Bhima, the sons of Madri, Virata, Drupada, and even Ghatotkacha were hit by many arrows.

Ghatotkacha, a strong warrior, fought bravely, cutting down many soldiers and elephants, but even he was hurt.  Then, King Yudhishthira shot many arrows at Duryodhana, hitting him hard!  Everyone thought Duryodhana was dead!

But then Duryodhana stood up again!  Drona, his teacher, came to help.  They fought together, pushing back the Pandavas.  It was a truly frightening and bloody battle!
