Once upon a time, after a big war, King Dhritarashtra and his family were very sad.  Their sons, the Kauravas, had lost the war.  They lived in the forest with the Pandavas, their nephews, who had won.  Dhritarashtra's wife, Gandhari, was especially heartbroken because all her sons were dead.

King Yudhishthira and the Pandavas lived happily in the forest for about a month. Then, a very wise and powerful man named Vyasa came to visit.  Many other wise men came too.  They all talked about good things.  

Vyasa noticed how sad Dhritarashtra and his family were.  Vyasa was so powerful, he could grant wishes. He asked Dhritarashtra, "What do you wish for, King? I can grant you a boon!"

Dhritarashtra was so sad. He missed his sons terribly. He felt guilty for the war and the many people who died.  He told Vyasa how he was heartbroken and wished he could see his sons again.

Gandhari, who was blind, also spoke. She was so sad for the loss of her sons, and for Kunti, who had lost her sons as well, and even Subhadra, who had lost her son. She missed her sons terribly and asked Vyasa to let them see their loved ones again, even if only for a moment.

Kunti, who also missed her sons, quietly thought about a secret, and a wonderful thing is about to happen!  Vyasa could read her mind and knew she had a wish too. He asked what she wanted, and she bravely told him her secret.


What will Vyasa do? What is Kunti's secret?  You'll have to read on to find out!
