Once upon a time, there was a princess named Sikhandini.  She needed help!  A powerful forest spirit, a Yaksha, agreed to help her, but he had a special request. He said, "I'll give you my strength and become a woman for a little while. But you must promise to give me back my body when you're finished." Sikhandini agreed.  Poof!  They swapped bodies.  Sikhandini became strong and brave!

Now, Sikhandini, who was a prince now, went home.  He told his father, King Drupada, everything. The King was so happy!  There had been a problem with a neighboring king, who thought Sikhandini was a girl. But now, he sent a message saying, "Sikhandini is a boy! You made a mistake."

The other king was angry. He sent a priest to yell at King Drupada, "You tricked me!" He threatened to attack. King Drupada calmly sent his own message back, explaining the truth.  The angry king still wasn't convinced, so he sent some ladies to check.  The ladies saw that Sikhandini was indeed a boy!

The angry king was now happy and brought lots of presents to King Drupada.  Then, he went home. Sikhandini was very happy.

Later, the Yaksha who had become a woman was visited by Kuvera, the king of the Yakshas. Kuvera was angry that the Yaksha hadn't come to see him.  He didn't know about the swap! The other Yakshas explained what happened. Kuvera was still angry and gave the Yaksha a curse: "You will stay a woman!"  But he later lessened the curse, saying the Yaksha could become a man again after Sikhandini died.

When the time came, Sikhandini returned the Yaksha's body. They were both happy! Sikhandini then went home and was taught to fight. He became a very strong warrior.

One day, the great warrior Bhishma learned Sikhandini's story. Bhishma had made a promise: He would never fight a woman.  He knew Sikhandini's story.  Even though Sikhandini was a great warrior, Bhishma knew he couldn't fight him because of his promise!  Everyone was surprised at Bhishma's decision. The story ended there.
