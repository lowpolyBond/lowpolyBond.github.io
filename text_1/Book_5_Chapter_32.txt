Sanjaya, a messenger, hurried to King Dhritarashtra's palace.  He'd just come from the Pandavas, the five brothers who were Dhritarashtra's nephews.  He told the gatekeeper, "Tell the king I'm here! I have very important news!"

The gatekeeper told Dhritarashtra, and the king said, "Let Sanjaya in! I'm happy to see him."

Sanjaya went in and bowed before the king. He said, "King Yudhishthira, the eldest Pandava, sends his greetings. He asks if you are well and happy with your sons and family."

Dhritarashtra asked, "And how is Yudhishthira? Is he happy with his brothers and friends?"

Sanjaya answered, "Yudhishthira is doing well. He wants his land back, but he's good and wise. He’s more interested in being good than in getting rich! He's like a puppet, though, moved by fate.  He’s suffering, showing how powerful fate is."

Sanjaya then talked about Dhritarashtra's bad choices. "You've been unfair and unkind, King," Sanjaya said. "Yudhishthira is so good, he's letting you take the blame for everything bad that happens.  Your sons are giving you bad advice.  They want to keep the Pandavas away from their rightful share of the kingdom.  Because of this, the Kuru family – everyone – will be destroyed."

Sanjaya continued, "Even Arjuna, a great warrior, went to heaven.  This shows how powerful fate is! We can try our best, but fate decides much of what happens to us. Because you didn't listen to good advice, you’ve lost your great kingdom."

Sanjaya was tired from his long journey. He said, "I'll rest now. Tomorrow, the Kurus will hear more from Yudhishthira."  He needed sleep before the big news was shared with everyone.
