After the big battle, Duryodhana, a Kaurava prince, went to Bhishma, a wise and powerful warrior.  He was sad.  Duryodhana said, "Bhishma, I fought the Pandavas.  I had a huge army, but I lost! Ghatotkacha, a powerful demon, helped them.  I need your help to defeat him."

Bhishma said, “Duryodhana, you should fight the Pandavas' best warriors like Yudhishthira or Arjuna.  But don't worry.  My friends, Drona, Kripa, and others, will fight Ghatotkacha with you.  Or, how about this? Bhagadatta, a very strong king, can fight Ghatotkacha instead.”

Bhishma then called Bhagadatta.  He said, “Bhagadatta, you are very brave and strong! Fight Ghatotkacha. You are his match!”

Bhagadatta roared like a lion and charged!  Bhima, Abhimanyu, Ghatotkacha, and other Pandava warriors fought back. It was a huge battle! Elephants crashed into each other. Soldiers fought with swords and spears.  Arrows flew everywhere!

Bhagadatta, on his huge elephant, Supratika, fought bravely. He rained arrows down on Bhima. Bhima fought back fiercely, killing many of Bhagadatta's soldiers.  Bhagadatta's elephant was hurt and ran away, crashing through the Pandava army.

The Pandavas attacked Bhagadatta again.  Ghatotkacha,  a huge and strong demon, threw a giant spear at Bhagadatta's elephant! Bhagadatta cut the spear in half with an arrow!  Then, he threw a huge javelin, but Ghatotkacha broke it easily! Everyone was amazed!

Bhagadatta fought hard. He shot many arrows, hurting Bhima, Ghatotkacha, and other Pandava warriors.  He even broke Bhima's chariot! Bhima jumped off and grabbed his club.

Just then, Arjuna arrived! He started fighting, too.  Bhagadatta fought the Panchalas and other Pandava soldiers.

Bhima later told Krishna and Arjuna all about the amazing battle with Bhagadatta and his powerful elephant.
