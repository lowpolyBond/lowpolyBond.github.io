Garuda, a giant bird, spoke to Galava. "God told me to take you somewhere amazing!  Which way should we go first? East, south, west, or north?"

Garuda explained, "The east is special!  That's where the sun rises first every day.  The good gods do their special prayers there at sunset.  It's where everything good starts!  Important things happened there long, long ago.  The first gods were born there.  They even chose their king, Indra, there! Indra and the other gods prayed there a lot. That's why it's called 'Purva,' which means 'first.'"

"The very first songs of the gods, the Vedas, were sung there! The sun god taught the very first prayers there, too.  The gods had their very first parties and feasts there.  Even the great god Varuna went there to become powerful.  The wise Vasishtha lived and died there.  The magic word 'Om' first grew strong there.  The gods even had a big hunt and offered the animals to other gods as a gift."

"The sun, with its thousand rays, shines brightly from the east. It burns away bad people there. The east is the doorway to heaven! It’s the best place to start our journey.  But," Garuda added, "if you’d rather go somewhere else, just tell me, and we'll go there instead!"
