King Drupada had a wonderful daughter. He taught her to read, write, paint, and fight with arrows!  Her mother wanted her to get married, just like a son.

King Drupada was worried. A long time ago, a powerful god had told him something special about his daughter.  He talked to his queen.  The queen said, "The god's words are true! Let's find a wife for our daughter."

They chose a princess from another kingdom, ruled by King Hiranyavarman, a very strong king with a huge army!  They married the princess to Sikhandin, King Drupada's daughter.

Sikhandin and the princess from King Hiranyavarmanâ€™s kingdom grew up together.  They soon discovered a secret: Sikhandin was actually a girl!

The princess's nurses were very upset. They told King Hiranyavarman. He was furious! He thought King Drupada had tricked him.

King Hiranyavarman sent a messenger to King Drupada. The messenger said, "King Hiranyavarman is angry! You tricked him! You gave him your daughter instead of a son!  He will attack and defeat you!"
