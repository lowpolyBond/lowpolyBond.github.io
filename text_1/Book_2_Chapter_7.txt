Once upon a time, Queen Kaikeyi had a friend named Manthara.  Manthara was a bit grumpy and hunchbacked.

One day, Manthara saw Ayodhya, the city, all decked out!  Flags were waving, streets were clean, and everyone was happy.  People were celebrating.  She saw priests bringing gifts for Rama, the prince.

Manthara was curious. She asked Ramaâ€™s nurse, "Why is everyone so happy? What's going on?"

The happy nurse told her, "Tomorrow, King Dasaratha will make Rama the prince!"

But Manthara wasn't happy. She felt jealous. She rushed to Queen Kaikeyi's room and woke her up.

"Wake up!" she hissed. "Something bad is going to happen!  Rama is going to become the prince, and your son will lose out!"

Queen Kaikeyi was worried.  "What do you mean?" she asked.

Manthara said, "The King is tricking you! He's only nice to your face. He wants to give everything to Rama's mother! You're being fooled! You need to act now to protect your son."

Manthara told Queen Kaikeyi that she was a great queen, and that she should ask for a reward from the King before it was too late.

Queen Kaikeyi, confused but also scared, believed Manthara.  She gave Manthara a beautiful jewel, thinking Manthara had given her good news.  Actually, Manthara had planted very bad ideas in her mind.  The seeds of a great sadness were sown.
