Once upon a time, a king went hunting in the forest. He and his men killed many animals.  Then, they got very hungry and thirsty. They walked and walked until they found a big, empty desert!

After crossing the desert, they found a beautiful forest! It was full of colorful flowers and singing birds.  Sweet-smelling breezes blew through the trees.  The trees were covered with juicy fruits, and buzzing bees flew everywhere.  It was a magical place!

The king was so happy to see such a wonderful place. He saw beautiful vines and flowers everywhere.  The forest was so colorful, it looked like a rainbow!  Monkeys and other happy creatures lived there too.  

Deep in the forest, the king found a special place where holy men lived.  A warm fire burned inside their peaceful home.  The ground was covered with soft flower petals.  A clear river flowed nearby, and pretty birds swam in it.  Deer grazed peacefully on the riverbank.

The king was amazed! This place felt like heaven!  He saw a very important holy man lived there, Rishi Kanwa. The king wanted to meet him.  He left his army at the edge of the forest and went to visit the holy man, taking only his minister and priest with him.

He forgot all about being hungry and thirsty. The forest was so lovely! He heard many holy men chanting prayers.  Some sang beautiful songs. Others were learning about the world and how to be good. The king saw so many wise and kind people, all living together peacefully.  It felt like a magical place, even better than heaven!  He was very happy to be there.  He wanted to stay and learn from these holy people.
