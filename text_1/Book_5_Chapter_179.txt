Once upon a time, a princess named Amva was in trouble.  A powerful warrior, Bhishma, took her away without her permission.  Amva's heart belonged to King Salwa, but Bhishma didn't know that.

Amva went to a wise holy man named Akritavrana for help.  Akritavrana said, "Amva, do you want me to ask King Salwa to marry you? Or do you want me to help you get revenge on Bhishma?"

Amva explained, "Bhishma took me away even though I loved King Salwa.  Please help me!"

Akritavrana said, "Amva, it sounds like Bhishma is the one who hurt you.  He should be the one who pays for his actions."

Amva agreed. She wanted Bhishma to be punished.  So Amva and Akritavrana went to meet a brave warrior named Rama. Rama was known for his strength and fairness.

Amva told Rama her sad story. She cried and asked Rama for help.  Rama listened carefully. He saw how sad and upset Amva was.

Rama said, "Don't worry, Amva. I will tell Bhishma to do what's right. If he doesn't listen, I will fight him!"

Amva said, "I want Bhishma to be punished for what he did! He is proud and mean, and he took me away by force!"

Rama understood. He promised Amva he would help her. He planned to talk to Bhishma.  If Bhishma didn't listen, Rama would fight him.  Amva felt a little bit better knowing Rama would help her.  She hoped for justice.
