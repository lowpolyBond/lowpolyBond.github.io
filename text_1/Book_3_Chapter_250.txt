Once upon a time, in the land of Bharat, King Duryodhana felt very sad. He was so scared of the Pandavas, he wanted to give up and die!

Some friendly giants, called Danavas, found him.  "Great King!" they boomed, "Why are you doing this?  Dying is bad! You are strong and brave! You have magical protection. Your body is super strong!" They explained that the top half of his body was made of super-strong Vajra, and the bottom half was made by a goddess herself!

"Don't worry," they said. "We'll help you win! Many strong warriors will fight for you.  They'll even be *possessed* by even stronger giants to make them unstoppable! Even Bhishma and Drona, who are usually nice, will fight for you – the giants will make them angry!"

The Danavas told Duryodhana that they even had a plan to defeat Arjuna, the Pandavas' best warrior.  "Karna, who’s super strong, will fight Arjuna, and we'll make sure Karna wins!" They added, "And we'll have thousands of super soldiers to help you!"

Duryodhana's friend, Karna, also encouraged him. "Don't be sad! You can win! I promise to defeat Arjuna!"  Karna said he would make sure the Pandavas lose.

The Danavas cheered him up.  Duryodhana felt much better. He believed the Danavas, and he decided he *would* fight the Pandavas.  He got ready for battle, his army huge and strong, ready to fight.  He marched to war, feeling confident and brave, ready to fight alongside Karna. And so, the great battle began.
