Once upon a time, during a terrible battle, a sad thing happened.  Gandhari, a queen, was very upset. Her son, Bhurishrava, was killed.  His body was lying there, pecked at by birds.  

Gandhari cried, "My poor husband, Somadatta! You don't see how awful this battle is.  It's like the end of the world! You don't see our brave son, who was a kind and generous man, lying dead. You can't hear his wives crying.  They are so sad, their clothes torn, their hair messy.  They have lost their husbands and sons."

She continued, "Bhurishrava's arm was cut off by a warrior.  He's being eaten by animals!  His golden umbrella, a symbol of his power, is broken. His wives are crying and falling to the ground.  Arjuna cut off Bhurishrava's arm, and Satyaki killed him! It was unfair!"

Gandhari showed everyone Bhurishrava’s arm. “Look!" she cried. "This arm used to hug and protect his wives. Now it's just lying here!  Arjuna, a great warrior, cut it off. What will people say about this?"

Then, Gandhari talked about Shakuni. Shakuni was a very clever man, but he was also very mean. Sahadeva, another warrior, killed him in battle. "Look," Gandhari said, "birds are pecking at Shakuni now. He used to be so important, with people fanning him. Now, he's just lying there.  He tricked my sons, and started this whole war. I’m worried that even in death, he might cause more trouble for my family."


Gandhari was heartbroken. She missed her sons and worried about her family.  The battle was over, but the sadness remained.
