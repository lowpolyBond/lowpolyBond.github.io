Once upon a time, a wise man named Yajnavalkya was talking to a king. He explained how everything is connected to the gods.

He said, "Our legs are like the gods, and walking is their power. Our bottom is connected to the sun, and going to the toilet is its work.  Our private parts are connected to Prajapati, the creator, and having babies is its power. Our hands are connected to Indra, the king of the gods, and working is their power. Our voice is connected to Agni, the god of fire, and talking is his power.  Our eyes are connected to the sun, and seeing is its power.  Our ears are connected to the directions, and hearing is their power. Our tongue is connected to water, and tasting is its power. Our nose is connected to the earth, and smelling is its power.  Our skin is connected to the wind, and feeling is its power. Our mind is connected to the moon, and thinking is its power.  Our soul is connected to a higher power, and knowing who we are is its power. Our understanding is connected to the highest power, and learning is its power."

Yajnavalkya then talked about how the world is made of three things: Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas.  Imagine a bright light—that's Sattwa!  Sattwa is like being kind, happy, and peaceful. It's like having lots of good qualities:  patience, joy, and being helpful to others.

Rajas is like a flickering flame—exciting but sometimes angry.  It's like being proud, selfish, and angry. It's feeling jealous or fighting with others.

Tamas is like darkness—sleepy and lazy. It's like being greedy, lazy, and unkind. It's like being mean, or not caring about others.

Just like one lamp can light many others, the world is full of many things made from these three things.  Everything is connected, from our bodies to the gods, and all are made up of these three qualities.  The wise king listened carefully, learning about the amazing connections in the world.
