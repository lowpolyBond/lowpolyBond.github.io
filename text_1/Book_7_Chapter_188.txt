Once upon a time, in a great battle, Duhsasana charged at Sahadeva!  His chariot zoomed, making the ground shake.  But Sahadeva was super-fast!  With one swift arrow, *whoosh*, he cut off Duhsasana's chariot driver's head!  Duhsasana didn't even notice at first! His horses ran wild without a driver.  Then Duhsasana saw what happened.

Sahadeva was a great chariot fighter. He quickly controlled his own horses. Everyone—even his enemies—cheered at how bravely he fought in that scary battle. He shot arrows at the runaway horses, and they galloped away.  He even put down his bow to grab the reins, then picked up his bow again!  While he did this, he kept shooting arrows at Duhsasana.

Then, Karna came to help. But Bhima was ready!  He shot three big arrows at Karna's chest and arms.  Karna roared like a bull, angry and hurt! A huge fight started between Bhima and Karna. They were so close, they couldn't even shoot arrows at each other! So they started swinging their big clubs! Bhima smashed Karna's chariot's special post.  Karna threw his club, but Bhima broke *that* one too!  Bhima threw another club, but Karna hit it with lots of arrows.  The club bounced back and broke Bhima's flag! It even hurt Bhima's driver.

Bhima was furious! He shot lots of arrows at Karna, breaking his flag, bow, and shield. Karna fought back, and killed Bhima's horses and drivers. Bhima quickly jumped onto Nakula's chariot to escape.

Meanwhile, Drona and Arjuna, teacher and student, fought an amazing battle! They were both super skilled with their weapons.  Everyone stopped fighting to watch them.  It was like two hawks fighting for a piece of meat in the sky!  They were so evenly matched; whatever Drona did, Arjuna did something just as amazing. Drona used his special magic weapons, but Arjuna destroyed them all! Then they used even more powerful weapons!  The sky filled with amazing light, and everyone watched in awe.

Gods, magical beings, and wise people watched. They said, "This isn't just a normal battle! It's like a god fighting himself!"  Drona even used his strongest weapon, but Arjuna stopped it with his own super weapon!  Finally, everyone started fighting again, a giant, confusing mess!  Arrows flew everywhere, like dark clouds in the sky.
