Once upon a time, a great fire burned down a huge forest called Khandava.  A king named Janamejaya was curious. He asked a wise man, "Why didn't the fire hurt the Sarngaka birds?"

The wise man, Vaisampayana, explained.  Long ago, there was a very good man named Mandapala. He was a holy man who did good deeds and studied hard.  But even though he was very good, he couldn't go to the happy place after he died because he didn't have any children.

The people in the happy place told him, "To go here, you need children!"  Mandapala wanted lots of children, quickly. He knew birds have lots of babies! So, he changed into a Sarngaka bird and had four baby birds with a bird named Jarita.

He left the eggs with Jarita while he went away. Jarita loved her babies and kept them safe in their eggs. Later, Mandapala saw a big fire coming to burn down the forest where his babies were!

He was worried!  He went to the fire god, Agni, and begged, "Please don't hurt my little baby birds!"  He praised Agni, calling him powerful and important. He said Agni was like the sun, the wind, and even a really smart teacher!

Agni was very happy with Mandapalaâ€™s kind words.  He said, "Okay, I'll protect your children!"  And that's why the fire didn't hurt Mandapala's baby birds.  They were safe because their father was kind and loving, and he asked the fire god nicely.
