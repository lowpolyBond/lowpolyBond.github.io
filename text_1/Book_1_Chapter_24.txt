Once upon a time, there was a giant, powerful bird named Garuda. He was so big and scary that everyone was afraid!  Garuda felt bad.  He made himself smaller so people wouldn't be scared.

Garuda wanted to visit his mom.  He flew across the big, big ocean, carrying his little brother, Aruna, on his back. He left Aruna in the east, just as the sun, Surya, was getting ready to be very, very angry.

"Why was Surya so angry?" asked Saunaka.

"Well," said Sauti, "Surya and another god, Soma, told everyone that Rahu was secretly drinking magic juice!  Rahu was very mad at Surya and Soma.  Rahu wanted to get revenge on Surya."

Rahu decided to make the world burn!  He was so angry, he started making the whole world super hot, even at night!  The wise people and the gods were worried.  They went to Brahma, the creator of the world, for help.

Brahma said, "Don't worry! Garuda's brother, Aruna, will help. He's strong and bright. He'll be Surya's driver, and he'll take away some of Surya's power!"

So, Aruna became Surya's charioteer. He blocked some of Surya's strong light, so the world didn't burn up. That's why Surya didn't destroy the world.

And that's the story of how Aruna saved the day!  Now, let's hear the next part of the story!
