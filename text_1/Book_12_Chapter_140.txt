Once upon a time, in a land far away, a good king named Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandpa, when bad times come and people are not kind, how should a king act?"

Bhishma smiled. "I'll tell you a story," he said. "It's about King Satrunjaya, a brave warrior. He went to a wise man, Bharadwaja, and asked, 'How do I get what I need? How do I keep it safe? And how do I use it wisely?'"

Bharadwaja said, "A king needs to be strong and brave! He must always be ready to protect his people.  He needs to watch his enemies carefully.  Being strong and brave makes everyone afraid of him.  This is very important!  Sometimes, being kind isn't enough.  Sometimes, you need to be tough.  Imagine a tree – if you cut the roots, the branches fall, right? A wise king cuts away the roots of his enemies, weakening them."

"A king should be brave in battle, but polite in words," said Bharadwaja. "He should be clever, like a fox, but kind to his friends. He should make friends with his enemy's friends. He should be nice to his enemies, but never trust them completely. It's like living with a snake – be nice, but be careful!"

Bharadwaja continued, "A king should be like a cuckoo (singing sweetly but always keeping a lookout), a boar (strong and determined), Mount Meru (strong and unmoving), an empty room (mysterious), an actor (changing as needed), and a loyal friend (true and supportive).  He should visit his enemies, even if bad things happen to them, and ask how they are. He should be like a tortoise, hiding his weaknesses, and like a lion, showing his strength when needed. He can enjoy things like music and hunting, but not too much."

"A king should be smart about when to fight and when to run away," Bharadwaja explained.  "He shouldn't let a defeated enemy recover, like a mother crab protecting her eggs.  He should be wise and plan for the future. He should always be ready, but never give up hope.  He should honor the enemies of his enemies, and use spies to find out his enemies' plans.  He should even use bad people to spy on his enemies, like thieves!"

Bharadwaja said, "A king should make sure that his enemies think they can trust him and then show his true strength when they least expect it. A wise king understands that sometimes, to protect his kingdom, he might even have to make difficult choices. Sometimes it's best to just finish the job, like removing a thorn properly so it doesn't get infected. He should be like a vulture, seeing everything from far away, like a crane, calm and steady, like a dog, alert, like a lion, brave, and like a snake, sly and quick."

"A king needs to always be prepared, and he needs to always do his best. Paying off all debts and destroying all his enemies, completely, is the best way to ensure peace," Bharadwaja advised. "Being kind can be a weapon too.  But sometimes, being strong and clever is the only way to protect your people."

King Satrunjaya listened carefully. He followed Bharadwaja’s advice, and he and his kingdom became very prosperous.  Bhishma finished his story, smiling.  "So, Yudhishthira," he said, "that's how a wise king acts in difficult times."
