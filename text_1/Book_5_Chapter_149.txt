King Dhritarashtra spoke to his son Duryodhana.  "My son," he said, "listen carefully.  Long ago, our family started with Soma, a powerful king.  Many, many years later, his great-great-great-grandson, Yayati, had five sons.  The oldest, Yadu, was very strong and proud.  He didn't listen to his father and was mean to his brothers.  Yayati was so angry, he kicked Yadu out!  He gave the kingdom to his younger, more obedient son, Puru.

Even further back, my grandfather, King Pratipa, had three sons: Devapi, Vahlika, and Santanu. Devapi was the oldest, kind and good, but he had a problem with his body.  Because of this, the wise people said he couldn't be king.  So, Devapi went to live in the forest. Vahlika went to live with his mother's family.  Santanu, the youngest, became king.  Even though I was the oldest, I couldn't be king because I also had a problem with my body.  My younger brother Pandu became king instead.

Now, Pandu is dead.  His sons, the Pandavas, are the rightful kings.  Yudhishthira, the oldest Pandava, is a good, kind, and fair king. He deserves the kingdom.  You, Duryodhana, are not a prince. You have no right to the kingdom! You want what doesn't belong to you. Be fair! Give Yudhishthira half the kingdom and live peacefully with your brothers."
