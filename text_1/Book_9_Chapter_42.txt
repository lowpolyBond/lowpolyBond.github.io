Once upon a time, there were two very powerful wise men, Vishvamitra and Vasishtha. They lived near a river called Sarasvati.  They were always competing to see who was the wisest and most powerful.  They argued a lot!

Vishvamitra was jealous of Vasishtha. He wanted to defeat him. Vishvamitra was very angry. He asked the river Sarasvati to bring Vasishtha to him. He wanted to hurt Vasishtha.

Sarasvati was scared of both Vishvamitra and Vasishtha.  They were both so powerful!  She didn't want to upset either of them.

Vasishtha was a kind and wise man. He saw Sarasvati was scared, so he told her, "Save yourself!  Let your strong current carry me away, otherwise Vishvamitra will be very angry."

So, the river Sarasvati's current became very strong and it swept Vasishtha away!  It carried him towards Vishvamitra.

When Vishvamitra saw Vasishtha, he was furious! But Sarasvati was so scared that he might hurt Vasishtha that she quickly carried Vasishtha to safety.

Vishvamitra was tricked!  He was so angry he cursed the river. He said, "Because you tricked me, your water will turn to blood!"

For a whole year, the river Sarasvati ran red like blood.  Everyone was very sad.  After that year, the river went back to its normal clear water.  And that’s why that part of the river is called Vasishthapravaha – because of the swift current that saved Vasishtha!  It was a very exciting and dangerous time!
