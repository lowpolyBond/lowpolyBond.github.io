King Dhritarashtra was sad. He asked Sanjaya, his advisor, "Why do you only tell me about the Pandavas winning?  They always seem happy and strong. My warriors are always losing and unhappy!"

Sanjaya said, "Your warriors are brave and fight hard, my King.  But the Pandavas are so strong, it's like the salty ocean making the pure Ganges River taste salty.  Their strength overcomes even the bravest of your soldiers. It's not your army's fault; it's fate. This terrible war is happening because of your mistakes and your sons' mistakes. Kings often die in battle. They fight for what they believe is right."

Sanjaya then told Dhritarashtra about a great battle:  Two strong brothers from Avanti fought Iravat. It was a furious battle!  Iravat shot many arrows, killing their horses. The brothers fought back bravely, even switching chariots!  Finally, Iravat won.

Next, Ghatotkacha, a powerful giant, fought Bhagadatta, a strong king. They fought so fiercely, it was hard to tell who was winning!  Ghatotkacha was hit many times, but he stood strong like a mountain.  Bhagadatta finally destroyed Ghatotkacha’s chariot, and Ghatotkacha ran away. Bhagadatta then attacked the Pandava army.

Then, Sahadeva and Nakula, the twin Pandava princes, fought their uncle, King Salya.  Salya shot arrows at them, but they fought back bravely.  Sahadeva shot Salya, hurting him badly, and Salya had to leave the battle.  The twins were so happy to have won!

Sanjaya finished, "Your army is losing, my King, but it's not your soldiers' fault. It’s fate.”
