Once upon a time, during a HUGE battle in the Mahabharata, the Pandavas' army almost won!  But the Kauravas, Duryodhana's side, fought back bravely.  Their warriors were fierce, like gods fighting monsters long ago!  Everyone fought hard; nobody gave up.

King Yudhishthira was very angry. He shot many arrows, hurting a Kaurava warrior named Kritavarma.  Another Kaurava, Ashvatthama, then saved a friend.

Then, seven hundred fast chariots zoomed towards Yudhishthira. They surrounded him, like dark clouds hiding the sun!  But the Pandavas, led by Shikhandi, rushed to help.  A terrible fight broke out!  Blood flowed like a river. The Pandavas won that battle, killing all seven hundred chariot warriors.

But then, more fighting!  This battle was even worse than the first.  The ground shook!  Fire fell from the sky!  Even the elephants cried!  But the warriors kept fighting.  They wanted to win and go to heaven!

Shakuni, a tricky warrior, said, "Let's attack from behind!" The Kauravas’ Madraka soldiers cheered and attacked again.  The Pandavas, with their great aim, fired many arrows.  Many Madraka soldiers died. The Kauravas started to run away.  But Shakuni, with ten thousand brave horsemen, attacked the Pandavas from behind.  They were like a strong wind scattering clouds. The Pandavas' army began to lose.

Yudhishthira told Sahadeva, "Shakuni is hurting us! Go with Draupadi's sons, seven hundred elephants, five thousand horses, and three thousand soldiers, and stop him!"

Sahadeva and his army fought Shakuni. It was a crazy fight! They used maces and spears, not just bows and arrows.  The sky was full of flying weapons. Many horses and soldiers fell.  It was so dusty and dark you could barely see!  Lots of soldiers got hurt and even killed each other by mistake.

After a short, fierce battle, both sides were tired and hurt.  Shakuni and his six thousand soldiers left.  The Pandavas, with six thousand horses, also retreated.

The Pandavas decided to change their strategy.  They would have chariots fight chariots and elephants fight elephants. But Shakuni wasn’t finished! He attacked again!  Another terrible battle started. Soldiers fought so hard they didn’t even care if they lived or died.  They fought with fists and feet. It was a terrible, bloody mess!

The Kauravas were exhausted.  Many were hurt, and even killed their own friends and family in the confusion.  Animals howled, and the ground was covered in blood and dead bodies.

Finally, Shakuni and his small army attacked again.  But this time, the Pandavas were ready.  They surrounded him and fought until the battle ended.  This battle was so terrible and bloody, it showed how terrible war truly is.
