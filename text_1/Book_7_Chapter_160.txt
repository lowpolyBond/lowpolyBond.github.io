The Pandava brothers, Yudhishthira and Bhima, surrounded Drona's son in battle.  Duryodhana and his friend rushed to help!  A HUGE battle started! It was so scary, even brave warriors felt afraid.

Yudhishthira was angry. He fought bravely, defeating many soldiers from different kingdoms. Bhima was strong too! He fought hard and the ground became bloody.  Arjuna, the best archer, also fought bravely, defeating many enemies.  Elephants fell like huge hills!  The battlefield was covered with broken elephant tusks and the fallen umbrellas of dead kings.  It looked like a sparkly night sky!

Near Drona's chariot, it was very noisy. Everyone shouted, "Kill! Fight! Attack!"  Drona, furious, fought back like a strong wind destroying clouds.  But Dronaâ€™s army, the Panchalas, got scared and ran away!

Arjuna and Bhima stopped their army from running.  They attacked Drona together. Arjuna attacked one side and Bhima attacked the other.  They shot many arrows!  Their friends from other kingdoms joined the fight.  Duryodhana's army fought hard to help Drona, but the Pandavas were very strong.

Arjuna and Bhima fought so bravely that Duryodhana's army started to lose.  Even Duryodhana and Drona tried to stop their soldiers from running away, but it was no use. The Pandavas were winning!  Many soldiers dropped their weapons and ran, scared and defeated.  The battle was over, and the Pandavas had won!
