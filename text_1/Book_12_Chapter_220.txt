King Yudhishthira asked, "Uncle Bhishma, how can we be happy? How do we get into trouble?  And how can we be brave and successful?"

Bhishma, the wise old warrior, smiled. "Long ago, wise people learned that self-control is the key.  It's like training your mind to be strong and calm.  For everyone, but especially priests, self-control is very important.  You can't do good things and be a good person without it.  Self-control helps with praying, doing good deeds, and telling the truth."

"Self-control makes you strong. It's holy and keeps you safe from doing wrong.  A person with self-control sleeps well, wakes up happy, and lives a good life.  They stay calm even when things are exciting.  Someone without self-control can't do these things."

"Self-control helps you see your bad feelings – like anger, greed, and jealousy – as if they are in another person.  People without self-control are scary, like wild animals.  That's why kings are here to help keep order."

"Self-control is the best thing you can do, even more important than anything else.  People with self-control are kind, calm, happy with what they have, and truthful. They are forgiving, humble, and respectful. They are nice to everyone and don't gossip. They don't brag or put others down. They care about being a good person more than being happy or sad right now."

"They aren't angry or tricky.  They are brave and strong.  They are good people, and everyone likes them. Because they help others, they are happy. They are peaceful, like the ocean on a calm day. They are wise and fearless. They aren't upset by bad luck and don't get too excited about good luck.  They are good people, almost like they are reborn as better people."

"People who aren't self-controlled are mean. They are greedy and jealous. They are always angry and boastful.  But priests with self-control are very strong. They do hard things, stay calm, and wait patiently."

"So, to be happy and successful, remember: self-control is the key!"
