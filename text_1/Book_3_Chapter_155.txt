Once upon a time, the Pandava brothers – Yudhishthira, Bhima, and the others –  were traveling with their friends and wise Brahmins.  They visited many special places.

They saw beautiful forests and holy rivers.  They bathed in the Ganga, Yamuna, and many other sacred rivers.  They prayed to the gods with flowers and water.  They offered fruits to their ancestors. They even visited the amazing Himalaya mountains and saw a special jujube tree where the great sages Nara and Narayana lived!

They saw a magical lake that the gods and wise people loved.  Yudhishthira said, "We've seen so many wonderful places!  Bhima, how do we get to Kuvera's palace?"  Kuvera was a rich god who lived in a magical place.

Suddenly, a voice boomed from the sky!  The voice said, "You can't go to Kuvera's palace directly. Go back to Nara and Narayana's home. From there, visit the beautiful hermitage of Vrishaparva and then Arshtisena's hermitage.  Then you will see Kuvera's home!"

A lovely breeze blew, smelling sweet and magical, and flowers rained down from the sky. Everyone was amazed!  A wise Brahmin named Dhaumya said, "The voice is right, we should follow its instructions."

So, Yudhishthira, Bhima, and the others went back to Nara and Narayana’s home. They lived happily there with their brothers, Draupadi (Panchali), and the Brahmins.  They knew their adventure wasn't over yet, and they were excited for what came next!
