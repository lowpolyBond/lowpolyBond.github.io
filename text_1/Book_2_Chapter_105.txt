Once upon a time, after their father died, four brothers – Rama, Bharata, Lakshmana, and Shatrughna – were very sad.  They spent the night crying.  The next morning, they prayed by a river.  Then they sat quietly together, not saying a word.

Bharata, one of the brothers, finally spoke. He said to Rama, "Brother, our father gave me the kingdom.  My mother wants me to rule. But I can't!  I'm like a donkey trying to run as fast as a horse, or a little bird trying to fly like an eagle.  I need you to be king! You're the only one who can rule the kingdom well. Please, take the throne."  Everyone cheered when Bharata finished speaking.

Rama, who was kind and gentle, felt sorry for Bharata.  He said, “Bharata, everyone dies someday.  It's like a fruit falling from a tree when it's ripe.  It's natural.  Our father lived a long life.  He was a good king. He did many good things and now he is in heaven. Don't be so sad.”

Rama explained that everything changes.  Friends and family leave us.  Good times and bad times come and go.  Just like a river keeps flowing, our lives go on.  He said we should always do what is right. Their father, he said, had been a great king, and had lived a good life.

Rama reminded Bharata that their father had ordered him to rule Ayodhya.  Rama said, "I have to listen to my father too. I will go live in the forest.  It's important to obey our parents, Bharata. You should return to the kingdom and rule."

Rama was very wise. He didn't want Bharata to be sad anymore.  He knew that following their father's wishes was the best thing to do.  So Rama stayed quiet after he finished speaking.
