Once upon a time, the Pandava brothers – five amazing princes – asked a wise old man named Markandeya to tell them about great kings.  Markandeya said, "Let me tell you about King Sivi!"

King Sivi was a super kind and brave king.  One day, he was riding in his chariot when he met King Suhotra, another powerful king.  Both kings were very proud and neither wanted to move aside.  They were stuck!

Then, a wise god named Narada appeared.  "Why are you blocking each other?" he asked.

The kings explained, "We're both equally great!"

Narada smiled. He said, "A good person is always good, even to a bad person. A truly good person is even better to another good person. King Sivi, you are known for your kindness.  You should go first."

King Suhotra understood. He admired King Sivi’s goodness. He bowed to King Sivi and let him pass.  Narada explained that this showed how truly great kings are – kind, brave, and humble. That's the story of two great kings, and how kindness won the day!
