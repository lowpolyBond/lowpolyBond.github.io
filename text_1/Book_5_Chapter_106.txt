Once upon a time, a powerful king was making bad choices. He was mean, greedy, and hurt everyone around him. His friends and family tried to help, but he wouldn't listen.  A wise man named Narada explained why this happens.

Narada said, "It's hard to find good friends who give good advice.  And it's even harder to listen to that advice! Sometimes people are too stubborn."

To show how stubbornness can be bad, Narada told a story about a very wise man named Viswamitra.  He was so busy being good and doing his work that he missed his chance to give food to a special guest.  

He felt terrible. For a whole hundred years, he waited to serve the same special guest!  A kind student, Galava, helped him during this time.

Finally, the guest came back, and Viswamitra was happy! He told Galava, "You can go now.  You've done enough."

But Galava was so grateful, he kept asking, "What can I give you as a gift?"  Viswamitra tried to say, "No, go!", again and again, but Galava wouldn't leave!

Viswamitra finally got a little angry.  He said, "Okay, you are so stubborn! I want eight hundred white horses, each with one black ear!"  Then Galava finally went away.

Narada finished his story and said, "See?  Being stubborn can get you into trouble, just like it did Galava!"  The king should have listened to his friends, just like Galava should have listened to Viswamitra.
