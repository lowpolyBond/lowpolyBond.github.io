Once upon a time, there was a king named Yayati.  He was very rich and powerful. He did many, many good things. He gave away lots of gifts to wise people called Brahmins. He even gave away all the riches of bad people!

He fought alongside the good gods in a big battle. He was so strong and brave, like a god himself! He was smart too, and knew all about holy books.

Yayati did lots and lots of special ceremonies and parties.  He had many wives and children. But even with all his riches, power, and family, Yayati wasn't happy. He had too many wants. He realized that even all the gold, food, and beautiful things in the world couldn't make him truly happy.

So, Yayati decided to change. He gave up all his riches and power. He went to live quietly in the forest with his wives. He learned to be content, which means being happy with what he had.  

When Yayati died, a wise man told Srinjaya (another important person in the story) not to be sad.  Yayati lived a long, full life and learned a big lesson about happiness.  True happiness isn't about having everything, but about being content with what you have.
