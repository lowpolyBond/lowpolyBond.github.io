Once upon a time, after a big battle, good King Yudhishthira found himself in a scary place.  It was dark and gloomy.  He saw scary things like a river of blood, sharp thorns, and even ghosts!

Suddenly, the sky lit up!  All the gods arrived, led by the great Indra.  The scary things vanished, replaced by a sweet-smelling breeze.  The gods were happy to see Yudhishthira.

Indra, the king of the gods, spoke kindly to Yudhishthira.  "This was a test, my friend.  All kings must see this place, even good ones. You were shown this because of a little trick you played a long time ago. But don't worry, it's over!"

Indra explained that Yudhishthira, his brothers, and even his enemies, like Karna, had actually done good things and gone to a wonderful place in the sky.  Indra told Yudhishthira that he had been tested many times before. Once, as a dog! And that he had passed each test with kindness.

Then, Dharma, the god of righteousness (who was also Yudhishthira’s father!), told his son, “You were true and kind, and I am proud of you. This was your last test.”  Dharma said that everything Yudhishthira had seen was an illusion. His brothers were safe and happy.

Yudhishthira was told to bathe in the Heavenly Ganga river. When he did, he left behind his human body and became a shining god himself. He then joined his brothers and all his friends in a beautiful, happy place in the sky.  Everyone was happy, and Yudhishthira lived happily ever after among the gods.
