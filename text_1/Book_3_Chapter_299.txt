The sun god, Surya, talked to Karna, a brave warrior.  "Karna," Surya said, "Don't do anything that hurts you or your family!  People want to be famous, but not if it means dying. You want great fame, but it's not worth your life! Your family and friends only matter if you're alive.  Being a great king means being alive to be great! Fame is only good if you're alive to enjoy it. Fame for a dead person is like flowers on a dead body – it's no use."

Surya loved Karna and wanted to help him. "Because you worship me, I'm telling you this secret.  There’s a big secret, even the gods don't know it all.  But you’ll understand later.  Remember this: Never give Indra, the king of the gods, your earrings!"

Karna’s earrings made him look very handsome, like the moon in the night sky. Surya explained, "Fame only matters if you're alive. When Indra asks for your earrings, say no! Give him lots of good reasons why you can't give them to him.  Arjuna, a great warrior, will fight you.  With your earrings, you'll be unbeatable, even if Indra helps Arjuna!"

Surya repeated, "Keep your earrings, Karna! They're your secret to winning against Arjuna!"
