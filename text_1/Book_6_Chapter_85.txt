Once upon a time, during a big battle, King Yudhishthira fought a strong warrior named Srutayush.  Yudhishthira shot nine sharp arrows!  Srutayush fought back, hitting Yudhishthira with seven arrows that pierced his armor.  Ouch!

But Yudhishthira wasn't giving up! He shot an arrow right into Srutayush's heart. Then he knocked Srutayush's flag off his chariot!  Angry, Srutayush shot seven arrows back at Yudhishthira.  Yudhishthira got so angry, he looked like a scary fire! Even the gods were scared!

But Yudhishthira took a deep breath.  He used his skill and broke Srutayush's bow. Then he shot another arrow and hit Srutayush in the chest.  He even shot Srutayush's horses and driver! Srutayush was scared and ran away.

Next, two other warriors, Chekitana and Gautama, fought. They shot many arrows at each other.  Then Chekitana broke Gautama’s bow and knocked his driver off his chariot.  Chekitana jumped down and they fought with swords.  They fought so hard they both fell down, too tired to move.  Luckily, their friends helped them.

Another warrior, Dhrishtaketu, shot ninety arrows at his enemy!  But then, his enemy, Bhurisravas, shot back and knocked Dhrishtaketu off his chariot, even killing his horses and driver.  Dhrishtaketu quickly got on a new chariot.

Then, a young warrior named Abhimanyu fought many enemies at once! He was so brave, he didn’t even kill them, even though they were attacking him!  

Abhimanyu’s cousin, Arjuna, saw Abhimanyu fighting alone against many strong warriors.  Arjuna rushed to help with his white horses.  The enemy’s army got scared!  Arjuna fought a fierce battle, with arrows flying everywhere like rain. The battle was so fierce, blood flowed like water!
