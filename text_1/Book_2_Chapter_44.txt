Queen Kaushalya was very sad.  Her son, Rama, had left the kingdom. He went to live in the forest.  Queen Sumitra, another queen, saw Kaushalya crying.

"Why are you so sad?" she asked kindly. "Rama is a good and brave prince. He went to the forest to make his father happy. He’s doing what’s right."

"But he’s leaving his home!" cried Kaushalya. "And Lakshmana went with him, and Sita too!"

"Lakshmana is a loyal friend," said Sumitra. "And Sita loves Rama very much. They’re all together.  Rama is strong and brave. He's like the sun, nothing can hurt him. The forest will be cool and safe for him. The moon will keep him safe at night. Rama even has magic weapons! He’s fearless, like a lion!"

"But it’s so far away!" sobbed Kaushalya.

"Don't worry," said Sumitra.  "Rama will be back soon. He’s a wonderful prince, kind and good, and nothing bad will happen to him. He will return to the kingdom, and then you'll be so happy! You'll see him bowing down to you, and you'll cry tears of joy!"

Sumitra comforted Queen Kaushalya with kind words. She told her that Rama was strong and good, and he would return.  Kaushalya listened, and her sadness went away like rain clouds on a sunny day. She felt much better.
