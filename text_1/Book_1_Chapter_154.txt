Once upon a time, the Pandava brothers were sleeping in a forest.  Nearby, lived a scary Rakshasa named Hidimba.  Hidimba was HUGE and had long, sharp teeth. He was really, really hungry and wanted to eat people!  He had red hair and a big belly. He looked around and saw the Pandavas sleeping.

Hidimba told his sister, Hidimbi, "Sister, I smell people!  I'm starving! Go find out who they are and bring them to me. We'll eat them together!"

Hidimbi went to look.  She saw the Pandavas sleeping, but one brother, Bhima, was awake.  Bhima was strong and handsome.  Hidimbi fell in love with him instantly!  She thought, "I won't tell my brother to eat him! I want to marry Bhima!"

Hidimbi changed her scary Rakshasa look. She became beautiful! She went to Bhima and said, "Hello! Who are you? My brother, Hidimba, wants to eat you all, but I don't want that! I love you, Bhima! Will you marry me?"

Bhima said, "I can't leave my sleeping mother and brothers.  I would never let a Rakshasa hurt them."

Hidimbi said, "Don't worry! I'll protect you all!  I'll stop my brother!"

Bhima said, "I'm very strong.  I'm not afraid of your brother.  You can go or stay, I don't care!"

Hidimbi was amazed by Bhima's bravery. She chose love over obeying her brother.  She knew Bhima was the strongest person she'd ever met, and she was very happy to marry him.
