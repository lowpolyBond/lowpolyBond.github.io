King Yayati was a powerful king.  He was old and weak, but he wanted to be young again!  He made a deal with his sons.  He asked them to trade their youth for his.  His youngest son, Puru, was kind and agreed to help.

Yayati became young again! He had a wonderful time. He played in beautiful gardens, he lived in amazing palaces, and he was very happy.  But, a thousand years flew by quickly.  Yayati got old again, but he wasn't sad. He was grateful to Puru.

Yayati gave his youth back to Puru. Then he wanted to make Puru the king.  But Yayati's other sons were angry! They were older than Puru. They said, "It's not fair!  The oldest son should be king!"

Yayati explained, "My other sons didn't listen to me. Puru was the only one who helped me. He deserves to be king."  Even the wise people agreed.  Puru was a good son.

Yayati gave his kingdom to Puru. He went to live peacefully in the forest.  His sons started many different groups of people. And, guess what? You, O King, are related to Puru! Youâ€™re part of his family.
