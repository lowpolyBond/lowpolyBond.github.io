Bhishma, a wise old man, once said, "Everything starts with hard work and being good!  People who don't work hard don't get good things, even if they try.  Even the world was made with hard work!  Smart people, called Rishis, learned all their magic and wisdom by working really hard.  They even made food grow with hard work!  If you work really, really hard, you can even see amazing things.  Medicine, and everything good, comes from hard work.  If you want something, hard work will help you get it.  Even the gods got their powers from working hard!

There are many ways to work hard and be good.  You can be kind, tell the truth, and share your things.  But the best way is to work hard and not have fun sometimes.  Giving things away is very hard!  Being good to your mom is the best way to live.  People who know lots of magic are very special.  But the very best hard work is giving up things you enjoy.  People do this to be good and go to heaven.  It's even better than not eating!

Animals, birds, everyone works hard to be good.  The gods got their power from hard work too!  The stars and everything shiny in the sky?  All from hard work!  If you work very hard, you can even become a god!"
