Once upon a time, Kichaka, a mean man, was killed by Bhima, a very strong warrior.  Kichaka's family was very angry. They found Kichaka's body all broken.  They were scared!

They saw Krishna, a princess who was hiding her real identity, near a pillar. They blamed her for Kichaka's death. "She must die!" they shouted. They wanted to burn her with Kichaka's body.  King Virata, even though he knew it wasn't fair, let them take Krishna.

The Kichakas grabbed Krishna. They tied her up and were taking her to be burned!  Scared, Krishna cried out for help.  She called for her husbands, the strong Gandharvas (magical beings).

Bhima heard Krishna's cries. He jumped up right away!  "Don't worry," he said. "I'll help!"

Bhima quickly changed his clothes. He climbed a wall and ran to the cemetery. He saw a giant tree.  He pulled it out of the ground â€“ just like an elephant! He carried the HUGE tree on his shoulder.

When the Kichakas saw Bhima coming with the tree, they were terrified. They were so scared, they freed Krishna and ran away!  Bhima, using the giant tree like a weapon, defeated many of them.  He saved Krishna!

Bhima comforted Krishna. He told her, "You're safe now!" Then he went back to the palace, using a different way.  Lots and lots of Kichakas were dead. It looked like a forest had been blown down by a strong wind!

Everyone was amazed by Bhima's strength.  They were so shocked they couldn't even speak!
