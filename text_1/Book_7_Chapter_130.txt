Once, during a HUGE battle in the Mahabharata, things got really scary!  Everyone was worried.  Karna, a great warrior, charged towards Bhima, another strong warrior, like two angry elephants fighting in the jungle!

King Dhritarashtra was worried. He asked Sanjaya, "How did Bhima and Karna fight? Karna lost to Bhima before! How could they fight again?  Even my son Yudhishthira is scared of Karna!  How could Bhima fight someone so powerful? Karna is a great warrior, kind to priests, and never gives up! How did they fight near Arjuna's chariot?  Karna knew Bhima's family, so how could he fight him?  Bhima remembered all Karna's bad actions; how could *he* fight? My son Duryodhana hopes Karna will win. How did it go?"


Sanjaya said, "Bhima was going to meet Arjuna and Krishna. But Karna stopped him!  He rained arrows on Bhima like a storm! Karna smiled and said, 'Bhima, you're running away from a real fight!  Fight me!'

Bhima got angry and fought back!  He shot many arrows.  He wanted to win quickly! Karna was strong and wore special armor, but Bhima kept shooting!  Karna used his own arrows to block Bhima's.  He was a very skilled fighter!

Karna smiled, which made Bhima even angrier!  Bhima shot many arrows into Karna's chest. Then he shot even more!  But Karna shot so many arrows back that Bhima's chariot was covered in arrows!

Bhima didn't even feel the arrows!  He kept fighting! They kept shooting arrows at each other, lots and lots!  Bhima was covered in arrows, but he was strong like a porcupine!  He kept shooting back!

Finally, Bhima was so angry he shot many more arrows.  Then he broke Karna's bow!  He killed Karna's horses and his driver!  He shot more arrows into Karna's chest!  Karna was hurt and had to get a new chariot."
