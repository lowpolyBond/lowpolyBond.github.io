Arjuna asked Krishna, "You're friends with both the Pandavas and the Kauravas.  Please make peace between them! You're the best person to do it."

Krishna said, "I will go and try to make things right."

The next morning, the sun shone brightly.  It was a beautiful autumn day. Krishna, feeling strong and healthy, got ready to go. He bathed, dressed nicely, and prayed.  He then told his friend Satyaki, "Get my chariot ready!  Even though Duryodhana, Karna, and others are mean, we can't ignore them. We need to be prepared."

Krishna's chariot was amazing!  It shone like the sun, and was pulled by four powerful horses.  Even Garuda, a giant bird, landed on it!  Satyaki rode with Krishna.  As they left, the sky cleared, and lucky animals and birds followed them.  Many wise people and holy men also came to see Krishna off.  Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, and the other Pandavas came too, along with many other kings and warriors. They all went to support Krishna.

Yudhishthira hugged Krishna and said, "Please greet our mother Kunti. She's suffered so much because of us.  Please also greet our grandfather Dhritarashtra, and all the other important people â€“ Bhishma, Drona, Kripa, and everyone.  They are all old and important. We hope our mother is still alive."

Arjuna also spoke to Krishna.  "We want our kingdom back. If they give it to us peacefully, it will be good. But if Duryodhana is mean, I will fight!"

Bhima shouted with anger when Arjuna finished talking.  Everyone was scared!

Then Krishna, with a happy heart, rode away in his beautiful chariot.  On his way, he met some wise holy men. He talked with them. They told Krishna, "We want to see all the kings and you together.  We want to hear your wise words."

Krishna said, "I understand. I'll see you there!"  Then, Krishna continued his journey to meet the Kauravas.
