After the big battle, everyone went to see Bhishma, the brave warrior, who was lying hurt on a bed of arrows.  Lots of people came – kings, queens, and even children! They brought him flowers and sandalwood powder.  It was like a big party, except Bhishma was very, very sore.

Bhishma was thirsty. He asked for water, but he said, “I’m not a normal person anymore. I only want to see Arjuna.”

Arjuna, a super strong warrior, came to Bhishma. Bhishma asked him for water.  Arjuna, with his powerful bow, shot a special arrow into the ground.  Whoosh!  A cool, magical stream of water sprang up!  Everyone was amazed!  Bhishma drank the water.

Bhishma then told everyone, “Arjuna is the greatest warrior ever! He’s like the sun among stars, the ocean among rivers!” He told Duryodhana, the king who started the war, to make peace with the Pandavas.  Bhishma said, "Give half the kingdom to the Pandavas.  End the fighting!"

But Duryodhana didn’t listen.  He was too angry. He was like a sick person refusing medicine.  Bhishma sighed, even though his body was still burning with pain. He tried to calm down by using special breathing exercises.

Even though Bhishma tried his best to make peace, Duryodhana wouldn’t listen.  He ignored all the good advice.  The war would continue.
