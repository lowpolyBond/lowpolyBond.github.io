Once upon a time, there was a kind man named Jaratkaru.  He was very sad. He visited his ancestors' spirits – his grandfathers and fathers.  He cried, "I'm a bad son!  Please tell me how to make things right!"

His ancestors said, "Jaratkaru, you haven't married yet.  Why not?"

Jaratkaru said, "I wanted to live a simple life and focus on prayer.  But seeing you suffer, I want to help. I'll marry only if I find a woman with my same name, and she’s given to me freely – no need to take care of her."

Jaratkaru searched and searched for a bride. He was getting old, and he was still sad. He prayed to everyone – animals, spirits, everything! He said,  "My ancestors need my help! Please, if anyone has a daughter with my name, give her to me as a gift! I don’t need anything from her."

Some helpful snakes heard him. They told their king, Vasuki. Vasuki found a beautiful princess with the name Jaratkaru. He took her to the forest where Jaratkaru was praying.

Vasuki offered the princess to Jaratkaru.  But Jaratkaru was unsure. He asked, "Is her name really Jaratkaru? And will I really not have to look after her?"  Vasuki said yes, and Jaratkaru finally accepted her as his wife.  His ancestors were happy, and Jaratkaru finally felt peace!
