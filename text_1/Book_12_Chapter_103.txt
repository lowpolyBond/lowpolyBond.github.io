Once upon a time, a brave king named Yudhishthira asked his wise grandpa, Bhishma, a very important question.  "Grandpa," he said, "how should a king act towards his enemies? Some are mean, some are strong, and some have lots of friends and a big army!"

Bhishma smiled.  "Yudhishthira," he said, "I'll tell you a story.  It's about King Indra, the mighty king of the gods, and his wise teacher, Vrihaspati."

King Indra, the strongest god, went to Vrihaspati.  He bowed and said, "Wise teacher, how do I defeat my enemies without always fighting? Sometimes we win, sometimes we lose. How can I stay strong and powerful?"

Vrihaspati, who knew everything about being a good king, answered, "Never start a fight just to win. Only children fight angrily and refuse to forgive.  If you want to defeat an enemy, don't let them know you're angry! Don't show your anger, fear, or happiness. Keep those feelings secret.  Pretend to trust your enemy, even if you don't."

"Speak kindly to your enemies," Vrihaspati continued. "Don't be rude.  Be like a clever bird catcher who makes sounds like birds to trick them close.  Then, you can catch them!  Even after you win, stay alert. A bad enemy is like a fire – it can start again!"

"Don't fight a big battle if you can avoid it," Vrihaspati advised. "Make your enemy feel safe, then strike when they least expect it! Talk to your smart advisors.  A neglected enemy can become very dangerous."

"Use spies to learn your enemy's secrets," he said.  "Try to make their friends turn against them, give them gifts to trick them, or even use secret ways to harm them. But never be friends with your enemies!"

"Wait for the perfect moment to strike," Vrihaspati said. "Don't hurt your enemies more than you need to.  And never hurt them with mean words. When the time is right, attack quickly!"

"A king should only weaken his enemy, not destroy them completely," he added. "If you have a huge army, only *then* should you fight openly.  If they’re strong, use secret ways to defeat them, not kindness."

Vrihaspati also taught Indra how to spot a bad person. "A bad person talks behind people's backs, is jealous of others, and pretends not to hear good things about others.  They might fidget, bite their lips, or shake their heads. They don't keep their promises, eat alone, and always complain!"

Bhishma finished the story.  "Indra listened carefully," he said. "He followed Vrihaspati’s advice, and he always won!"
