Once upon a time, Sita, a beautiful princess, told her story to a kind old woman named Anasuya.  Anasuya loved listening to Sita's adventures.  But as the sun set behind the mountains, Anasuya said, "It's getting late, Sita! Look, the birds are going home to sleep.  The wise men are coming back from their baths, and the smoke from their fires looks like a pretty pigeon's neck.  Night is coming."

Anasuya gave Sita beautiful clothes and jewelry.  "Go now, dear Sita, and see your husband, Rama," she said.  Sita thanked Anasuya, put on the lovely gifts, and went to find Rama.

Rama was so happy to see Sita looking so beautiful! Sita told Rama about Anasuya and her wonderful gifts.  Rama and his brother Lakshmana were very grateful.

The next morning, Rama and Lakshmana went to see the wise men. The wise men warned Rama, "Prince, this forest is dangerous!  Evil creatures called asuras live here. They eat people!  Please, help us by getting rid of them."

Rama bravely went into the forest to protect the wise men and everyone else.  He was like the sun shining through dark clouds, chasing away the evil!  And that's the end of the story from Ayodhya!
