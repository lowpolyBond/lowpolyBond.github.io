Once upon a time, there was a very powerful and famous holy man named Kuni-Garga. He was so good and holy, he wished for a daughter, and *poof*!  A beautiful girl appeared.  He was so happy to see her, he went to live in heaven.

His daughter was very, very good. She spent her whole life praying and being holy.  She didn't want to get married because she hadn't found anyone worthy of her.  She prayed and prayed, becoming old and frail.  She was happy, even though she was very old and weak.

One day, a wise man named Narada told her, "You've been so good, but because you didn't marry, you can't go to heaven!"

The old woman was sad.  She went to some other holy men and said, "I'll give half my good deeds to anyone who marries me!"  A holy man named Sringavat agreed, but only if he could marry her for just one night! She agreed.

That night, she became young and beautiful again!  Sringavat was very happy.  The next morning, she said, "Our deal is done. Goodbye!"  Before she left, she said, "Anyone who spends one night in this special place and prays will get as much good karma as someone who's been holy their whole life!"  Then, she went to heaven.

Sringavat was sad to see her go. He got half her good deeds, as promised.  He was so sad, he died soon after and went to heaven too.

Thatâ€™s the story of the holy woman.  While all this was happening in heaven, a great warrior named Baladeva heard that his friend Shalya had died in a big battle.  He was very sad. He asked some holy men what had happened in the battle, and they told him everything.
