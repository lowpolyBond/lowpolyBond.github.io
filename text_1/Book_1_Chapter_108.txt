Once upon a time, there was a very holy man, a Rishi, named Mandavya.  He was so good and wise, people called him a tiger among holy men!  Someone wrongly accused him of a crime.  The king, without knowing the truth, had him tied to a stake.

Mandavya didn't blame anyone but himself.  The king's guards saw him still alive and told the king.  The king felt very sorry. He went to Mandavya and said, "I'm so sorry! Please forgive me!"

The king tried to pull the stake out, but it was stuck fast. He had to cut it off!  So, Mandavya walked around with part of the stake still in him.  Even with the pain, he kept being good and holy.  Because of the stake, everyone called him Ani-Mandavya, which means "Mandavya with the stake."

One day, Ani-Mandavya went to see the God of Justice. He asked, "Why am I suffering like this? What bad thing did I do?"

The God of Justice said, "When you were a little boy, you hurt a tiny insect. That small act caused all this suffering. Even small bad things grow into big problems."

Ani-Mandavya said, "But I was just a child!  A child shouldn't be punished for such a small thing. The scriptures say it's not a sin for someone under twelve." He added, "Punishing me so much for this is unfair! Killing a holy man is much worse."

Ani-Mandavya was so wise and powerful that he made a rule:  Actions done before the age of fourteen aren't considered sins.  Because he cursed the God of Justice, the God had to be reborn as Vidura, a very humble and wise man.

Vidura was clever and kind. He was always fair and never angry.  He helped the Kuru family, even though he was born into a humble family. He was a very good and wise man, all because of Ani-Mandavya's great wisdom and power.
