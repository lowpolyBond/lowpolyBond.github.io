Once upon a time, in the land of Kuru, Duryodhana, a naughty prince, ignored his mother's wise words.  He was angry! He went to talk to his sneaky friend, Sakuni.  They made a bad plan with Karna and Dussasana.

"Let's capture Krishna!" Duryodhana whispered. "He's helping the Pandavas, and if we get him, they'll be weak!"

Their plan was to grab Krishna, just like a strong king once grabbed a powerful enemy.  But a brave warrior named Satyaki overheard them. He knew they were planning something mean.

Satyaki quickly told Krishna, King Dhritarashtra, and the wise Vidura about Duryodhana's evil plan. He laughed, "These silly boys want to grab Krishna! It's like trying to catch fire with your clothes!"

Vidura, who was very smart, warned Dhritarashtra, "Your sons are planning something terrible! They can't win against Krishna! He's too strong!"

Krishna listened calmly. He said, "Let them try. If they want to hurt me, let them. I won't hurt them back. But they'll lose.  If they try this, I'll just give them to the Pandavas as a punishment!"

Dhritarashtra told Vidura to bring Duryodhana and his friends to him.  He wanted to reason with his son.

Dhritarashtra scolded Duryodhana, "Your plan is so foolish!  Krishna is like the wind, the moon, or the earth â€“ you can't capture him!  Even powerful beings couldn't stop him! He has defeated so many strong enemies before. Many have tried and failed!  Don't be so silly!"

Vidura reminded Duryodhana of all the times Krishna had easily defeated powerful enemies, even as a child. He defeated giants, and even held up a huge mountain!  "Trying to hurt Krishna is like an ant challenging a lion!" said Vidura.

Duryodhana finally understood how foolish his plan was.  He had been too angry and greedy. He learned that trying to defeat someone as powerful as Krishna was a very bad idea.
