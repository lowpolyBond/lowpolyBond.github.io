Once upon a time, there was a princess named Draupadi.  She was beautiful!  Many princes wanted to marry her.  They all came to a big contest.

Lots and lots of princes showed up.  They were strong and proud. They were like big, grumpy elephants during mating season!  They all wanted Draupadi.  They were all jealous of each other.  Even gods and magical beings came to watch!  Krishna and his friends were there too.

Krishna saw the five Pandava brothers.  He pointed them out to his friend.  The other princes were so busy looking at Draupadi, they didn't even notice the Pandavas.  Everyone was excited!

The princes had to string a super strong bow.  It was very, very hard!  One by one, the princes tried.  They were so strong, but the bow was too strong for them!  They fell down!  Their crowns and necklaces fell off.

Even a super strong prince named Karna tried. He was amazing!  He strung the bow. But Draupadi said, "I won't marry someone like him!"  So Karna gave up.  Other strong princes tried, but they couldn't do it either.  They all fell down!

Finally, it was Arjuna's turn.  Arjuna was one of the Pandava brothers.  He was ready to try the bow...
