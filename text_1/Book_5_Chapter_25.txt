Once upon a time, there was a big fight about to happen between two families: the Pandavas and the Kauravas.  Sanjaya, a messenger, arrived at the Pandavas' camp.

Yudhishthira, the Pandava king, asked, "Sanjaya, what message does King Dhritarashtra have for us?"

Sanjaya greeted all the Pandavas, including the strong Bhima, the brave Arjuna, and their friends Krishna and Satyaki.  He said, "King Dhritarashtra wants peace! He sent me to ask you to stop the fighting."

Sanjaya explained that the Kauravas wanted peace too. He said, "The Pandavas are kind and brave. You are known for your goodness.  Fighting your own family would be a terrible shame, like a tiny spot of dirt on a beautiful white cloth.  Winning a battle wouldn't be worth it, because it would mean killing many of your relatives.  It would be like a sad, sad ending."

Sanjaya said the Pandavas were very strong, with powerful friends like Krishna and Arjuna to help them.  But the Kauravas were also strong, with warriors like Bhishma, Drona, and Karna.  A battle would be terrible for everyone.

Sanjaya bowed to Krishna and the king of Panchala.  He pleaded with the Pandavas, "Please choose peace! Don't fight!  Let's all be friends again. That's what King Dhritarashtra and Bhishma want."  He hoped the Pandavas would agree to peace. He really, really wanted them to say yes.
