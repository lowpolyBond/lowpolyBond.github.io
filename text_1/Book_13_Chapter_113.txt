King Yudhishthira asked a wise man, "Which is best: not hurting others, praying, thinking quietly, controlling our wants, doing good deeds, or obeying our teachers?"

The wise man, Vrihaspati, said, "They're all good!  They're like different doors to being good.  But the best thing is to be kind to everyone.  If you control your anger, greed, and bad feelings, you'll be happy.  Never hurt anyone; it will hurt you back!  Imagine how you'd feel if someone hurt you.  Don't do that to others.  If you're kind to someone, they'll be kind back.  Treat everyone like you would want to be treated."

He added, "The gods themselves can't even find someone who is so good and kind to everyone because they leave no bad marks on the world.  It's like leaving no footprints in the sand!"

Vrihaspati, the wise teacher, said all this to Yudhishthira, then went up to heaven!
