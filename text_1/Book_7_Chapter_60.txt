Once upon a time, there was a great king named Bhagiratha.  He was super generous!  He made beautiful golden stairs along the river Ganga, which was named after him.

For his special ceremonies, he gave away tons of gifts!  He gave thousands upon thousands of girls, each riding in a fancy chariot pulled by four horses. Each chariot had a hundred cows following it, with even more goats and sheep behind the cows!

One day, the river Ganga was very sad. She felt scared and asked King Bhagiratha to protect her.  She sat on his lap. Because of this, Ganga became like his daughter, and everyone called her Ganga.  

Beautiful singing spirits called Gandharvas sang about this happy event to everyone – the gods, wise people, and even regular people.

King Bhagiratha was a very good king. The gods helped him with his ceremonies, because he was so kind. He gave the wise people anything they wanted! He was so generous, that the wise people even waited on him, just like they waited on the sun.

King Bhagiratha eventually died and went to a wonderful place.  So, don’t be sad, Srinjaya!  He lived a good life and gave so much, unlike someone who didn't give anything at all.  Remember that being kind and generous is more important than anything else.
