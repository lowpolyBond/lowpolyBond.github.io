Long ago, there was a great king named Janaka.  He was about to go to war!  Before the battle, he talked to his brave soldiers.

"Look," he said, "if you fight bravely, youâ€™ll go to a wonderful place after you die! It's full of beautiful music, amazing things, and happy friends forever!"

He pointed to another place. "But if you run away, you'll go to a scary, dark place! It's gloomy and awful, and you'll be unhappy forever!"

Janaka's soldiers were so inspired! They fought hard and won the battle.

Janaka was a wise king. He taught his army how to line up for battle. "The strongest warriors go first," he said.  "Then the chariot fighters, then the horse riders, and finally, the foot soldiers at the back."  This way, they were always ready to fight!

He also told them, "Don't chase the enemy too far when they run away.  They might turn around and fight back!"

Janaka explained, "Brave soldiers don't attack those who are already running.  Strong people win, not weak ones.  The world needs brave heroes to keep it safe!"

Janaka's soldiers were happy and strong because they knew their king was wise. They were brave because they knew what was good and bad.  They knew being a hero was the best thing to be!
