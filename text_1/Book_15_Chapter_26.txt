King Dhritarashtra asked Yudhishthira, "Are you and everyone in your kingdom happy? Are your helpers and advisors happy?  Is everyone safe? Are you a good king, following the rules? Is your treasury full, but fairly earned? Are you kind to your friends, enemies, and neighbors? Do you always help the priests first? Are your people, family, and friends happy with you? Do you pray to the gods and honor your ancestors?  Do you feed your guests? Do everyone in your kingdom—the priests, soldiers, farmers, and everyone else—do what is right? Are all the women, children, and old people safe and cared for? Are the women in your family happy?"

Yudhishthira, a very wise king, asked Dhritarashtra, "Are you peaceful and happy, my dear uncle? Is Mother Gandhari okay? Is she doing alright living in the forest? Is she still sad about all our brothers who died in the war? Does she blame us?"  He continued, "Where's Vidura?  And is Sanjaya well?"

Dhritarashtra said, "Vidura is fine. He's very holy now. He's living in the forest, eating only air, and he’s very thin."

Just then, they saw Vidura in the distance!  He was very thin, his hair was matted, and he was almost naked. He looked like a holy man. Yudhishthira ran to him.  "Vidura! It's me, Yudhishthira!" he called.

Vidura, very thin and weak, stood still.  Suddenly, Yudhishthira felt strange. Vidura's spirit entered his body!  Yudhishthira felt stronger and wiser.  Then, he saw Vidura's body fall to the ground. He was gone.  A voice said, "Don't burn Vidura's body. His spirit lives on. He was a very good man."

Yudhishthira told Dhritarashtra what happened.  Dhritarashtra was amazed! He gave Yudhishthira some fruit and water. They all ate and slept under a tree that night.
