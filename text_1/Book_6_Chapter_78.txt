Sanjaya told the king, "Duryodhana was still fighting Bhima!  He threw lots of arrows.  Then, the Pandava princes, Yudhishthira's sons, joined the battle to help Bhima. Bhima got back on his chariot and fought bravely. He had a strong, golden bow that could kill enemies. He shot many arrows at Duryodhana's sons.

Duryodhana shot Bhima right in the chest!  But Bhima was angry!  He shot Duryodhana three timesâ€”in the arms and chest!  Duryodhana didn't even move, he was so strong, like a big mountain!

Duryodhana's brothers saw this. They wanted to attack Bhima's brother, Vrikodara.  They all attacked together! Bhima fought like a strong elephant! He shot Chitrasena with a long arrow and then he fought all of Duryodhana's other sons. He used many golden arrows.

Then, King Yudhishthira sent twelve strong warriors, including Abhimanyu, to help Bhima.  They were shining and bright, like the sun!  When Duryodhana's sons saw all these new warriors, they were scared and ran away!  But the Pandavas were angry that Duryodhana's sons ran away without a good fight."
