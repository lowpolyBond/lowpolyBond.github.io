Once upon a time, there was a very good king named Rama.  He was the son of King Dasaratha.  Everyone loved Rama, just like a dad loves his children. He was strong and kind.

Rama's father asked him to live in the forest for fourteen years with his wife, Sita.  While there, Rama fought many, many evil Rakshasas (monsters)! He even killed fourteen thousand of them to protect the holy people living in the forest.

One day, a very bad Rakshasa named Ravana tricked Rama and took Sita away!  Rama was very angry. He fought Ravana and won!  He was so strong that even the gods and other powerful beings couldn't defeat Ravana, but Rama could.

Rama was a great king. He ruled wisely and kindly.  He made sure everyone was happy and healthy. He did special ceremonies and prayers.  Because of Rama, everyone lived long lives, had lots of children, and there was no sickness or sadness.  The world was a beautiful place.  Animals were peaceful, and everyone was kind and good.  There weren't any bad guys.

Rama ruled for eleven thousand years!  He was so loved that even the gods in the sky were happy. Then, Rama went to heaven. He left behind a strong family and a wonderful kingdom.

So, even though Rama died, you shouldn't be sad. He was a wonderful king, and his memory will live on forever.  He was much better than anyone else!
