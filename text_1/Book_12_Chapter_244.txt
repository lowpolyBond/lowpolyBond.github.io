Once upon a time, a wise old man named Bhishma explained the different stages of life. He said, "After you've lived a good life at home with your family, it's time for a new adventure!"

This new adventure was called Vanaprastha, or forest life.  Bhishma told a king named Yudhishthira, "When you get old and have grandchildren, it's time to go live in the forest."

Vyasa, another wise man, added, "In the forest, you'll still be good. You'll pray to the gods and make small offerings. You'll eat simple food – only once a day!  You’ll take care of cows, and share what you have with others. You'll eat whatever you find growing wild, or leftovers from your meals with guests."

There were different ways to live in the forest. Some people only gathered enough food for the day. Others gathered enough for a month, or even a whole year! They’d face the rain, the heat, and the cold, but they’d always be kind and share their food. They’d sleep on the ground and be very simple.

Bhishma said, "After the forest stage, there's one more, even better!" This last stage was called Sannyasa, or renunciation.

"In this stage," Vyasa explained, "you let go of all your belongings and worries. You focus on yourself and being good. You eat very little, and you're always kind to everyone.  You don't care about getting things or having much. You just live simply, peacefully, and happily, close to God."

Many wise people followed this path, like Agastya and the seven great Rishis. They showed everyone that a simple life brings great happiness and peace.  They became like shining stars in the sky! So, after a long and happy life, when you're very old and ready, you can leave everything behind and find inner peace.  That’s the final, and greatest, adventure!
