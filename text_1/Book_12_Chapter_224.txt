Once upon a time, mighty Vali, a powerful king, was changed into a donkey!  Indra, the king of the gods, saw him and laughed.  "Vali," Indra said, "you used to be so great and powerful, surrounded by friends and armies. Now you're alone.  Aren't you sad?"

Vali smiled. "Indra," he said, "everything changes.  Our bodies are like the leaves on a tree – they fall. This donkey body isn’t my fault.  Everything is born, grows, and dies. I understand this, so I'm not sad.  Just like all rivers flow to the ocean, all living things eventually die. People who understand this aren't afraid."

He continued, "People who don't understand this get upset when things go wrong.  But if you're wise and kind, you won't worry.  Winning or losing, life or death – it's all part of the same journey. When someone is killed, only their body is hurt. It’s not really *them* that’s killed. It’s like Time doing the killing."

Vali explained, “Everything comes from earth, air, water, fire, and space.  Time is like a huge, endless ocean. It takes everything – rich or poor, beautiful or ugly, strong or weak. It takes everyone eventually. If I didn't know this, I might be angry, but I do know this.  So why be sad?"

Indra was surprised. “You were so powerful,” he said. “You could change into scary forms! Why not now?”

Vali answered, “Time gives and Time takes away.  Time controls everything.  Don't be proud, Indra.  I used to be strong and fearsome, but even I am changed by Time. I understand the truth. Being rich or poor isn’t something we can control. It’s like a game, and Time is the player who decides who wins and loses.”

Vali went on, "Everyone used to bow to me, but I don’t miss that.  I accept Time’s plan.  Some people are born lucky, others unlucky, some beautiful and some not, some strong and some weak. It’s just how Time works.  You are rich and powerful now, Indra, but Time will change that too.  Your wealth isn't yours forever.  It’s Time that controls everything."

He finished, "Time is like Brahma, the creator.  He has no beginning and no end.  People talk about Brahma in different ways, but it's all the same thing – Time!  Many great kings like me have come and gone. You will too, Indra. So don't be so boastful! Be peaceful."
