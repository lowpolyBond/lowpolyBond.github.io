King Dhritarashtra asked, "Sanjaya, tell me about the great battle! What happened when Arjuna went to fight?"

Sanjaya said, "The Pandava army was huge!  It was like a giant storm cloud, full of soldiers and loud noises.  Their drums and horns roared like thunder.

The battle was terrible!  It was like a terrible storm, raining weapons instead of water.  Giant elephants were like the storm clouds.  Swords, arrows, and spears were like the rain.  It was a very scary and loud battle!

Many brave warriors fought.  Sometimes one warrior would fight many others.  Sometimes a single warrior would defeat many enemies.  Even elephants and horses joined the fight!

Arjuna shot so many arrows, he defeated tons of enemy soldiers, elephants, and horses!

Many other heroes fought bravely.  Kripa fought Shikhandi. Satyaki fought Duryodhana.  Many other soldiers fought each other too!  Sahadeva fought Shakuni like a fierce lion!  Nakula fought Kritavarma.  Dhrishtadyumna, a strong warrior, fought Karna, the leader of the Kaurava army.  Bhima fought Dushasana and his army.

Uttamauja was a very strong warrior. He fought Karna's son, Sushena, and cut off his head!  Karna was very sad, but he got angry and attacked Uttamauja.

Then Uttamauja helped Shikhandi. Kripa lost his chariot, but Drona’s son saved him.

Finally, Bhima, strong as the sun, used his arrows to defeat many of the king’s sons!"
