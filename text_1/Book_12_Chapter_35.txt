Once upon a time, in the land of Bharat, a wise teacher was talking to Arjuna, a brave warrior.  Arjuna wanted to know about doing things that might seem wrong, but weren't really bad.

The teacher said, "Arjuna, sometimes even bad actions aren't really bad. For example, if a priest attacks you with a weapon, you can fight back and even hurt him.  That's okay; you’re not a bad person for defending yourself."

He explained that the holy books say this is true.  "If a priest forgets his duties and attacks you, it's like a fight between two angry people.  You’re not guilty of harming a priest."

"And," the teacher continued, "if someone drinks alcohol because they're very sick, or because a doctor told them to, it's not a sin.  They just need to do a special cleansing ritual."  The same was true for eating forbidden food – a special ritual could make things right.

The teacher also said that a student who does something his teacher asks him to do, even if it seems wrong, isn't guilty.  For example, if a student steals something for his teacher, and only for his teacher, that is okay! But stealing to get things for himself is wrong.

Telling a lie is also sometimes okay. You can lie to save someone's life, or to help your teacher, or to make someone happy, or even to arrange a wedding!  And having a bad dream doesn't mean a boy broke his promise to stay pure. He just has to pour some melted butter into a fire.

If an older brother leaves home or dies, a younger brother can still get married without feeling bad. A man isn’t a bad person if he has to sleep with a woman who asks him to, and it’s okay to only kill animals for special ceremonies.  Giving something to the wrong person by accident, or forgetting to give to the right person, isn't a sin.  A husband doesn't do anything wrong by sending away a wife who cheats on him.  And it's all right to sell special juice if you know how to use it correctly.  Firing a bad worker isn't a sin, either.

The teacher finished, "Arjuna, I've told you about things that aren't really sins. Now, I'll tell you how to fix things if you accidentally do something wrong!"
