Once upon a time, in a great battle, Indrajit, Ravana's son, was very strong. He shot many arrows at Rama and Lakshmana, the brave brothers.  The arrows trapped them like birds in a cage!  They fell to the ground, hurt and unable to move.

Sugriva, the monkey king, and all his monkey friends rushed to help.  They surrounded Rama and Lakshmana.  Vibhishana, Ravana's good brother, arrived too. He used special magic to wake them up and Sugriva pulled out the arrows.  A magical medicine made them feel better very quickly.

Vibhishana then gave Rama some special water.  "This water," he said, "will let you see things that are normally hidden!" Rama, Lakshmana, and all the monkeys splashed the water in their eyes. Now they could see invisible creatures!

Meanwhile, Indrajit told his father, Ravana, about his victory.  He went back to battle.  Lakshmana, wanting to fight Indrajit,  attacked him. They fought fiercely, like gods fighting long ago!

Indrajit hurt Lakshmana badly, but Lakshmana fought back bravely.  With three special arrows, Lakshmana cut off Indrajit's arms and head! Indrajit died. Lakshmana even killed Indrajitâ€™s charioteer.

Ravana was very sad when he saw his son's empty chariot.  His sadness made him angry, and he wanted to kill Sita, Rama's wife, who was held captive.

But Avindhya, a wise advisor, stopped him. "Don't kill a woman," he said. "She's already a prisoner. If you kill her husband, Rama, she will be heartbroken, which is the same as being killed." Ravana listened and decided not to kill Sita. Instead, he decided to fight Rama himself. He got ready for another big battle!
