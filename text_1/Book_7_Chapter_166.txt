Once upon a time, during a big battle, there was a brave warrior named Sahadeva. He wanted to help his friend, so he fought Karna, a very strong warrior.

Sahadeva shot nine arrows at Karna, then nine more!  Karna was powerful, though. He shot back one hundred arrows!  He even broke Sahadeva's bow.

But Sahadeva was tough! He grabbed a new bow and shot twenty arrows at Karna. That was amazing!

Karna fought back fiercely. He shot arrows at Sahadeva's horses, making them fall.  Then he hit Sahadeva's chariot driver, and the driver had to leave the battle.

Now Sahadeva was without his chariot. He picked up a sword and shield, but Karna cut those down too!  Then Sahadeva threw a big, heavy mace, but Karna cut that down as well.  Next, Sahadeva even threw a spear, which Karna also sliced in two!

Sahadeva was running out of weapons!  In a rage, he grabbed a chariot wheel and threw it.  But Karna, using thousands of arrows, cut the wheel to pieces!

Sahadeva had nothing left!  He threw everything he could find: parts of his chariot, even dead bodies! Karna cut them all down!

Finally, Sahadeva was hurt and had no more weapons.  Karna could have killed him, but he remembered a promise he'd made.  Instead, Karna told Sahadeva kindly, "Don't fight warriors stronger than you! Fight those your own size."  He even tapped Sahadeva gently with his bow.  Then he told Sahadeva to go help his friend Arjuna, or go home.

Karna spared Sahadeva's life.  Sahadeva, sad and hurt, left the battle and climbed into another chariot. He was very upset, not just from his injuries, but from Karna's words.
