Once upon a time, after the Pandava brothers won the kingdom of Indraprastha,  a prince named Janamejaya wanted to know how they lived.  He asked a wise man, "How did the Pandavas and their wife, Draupadi, live together happily without fighting?"

The wise man, Vaisampayana, said, "The Pandavas lived happily in their kingdom.  Yudhishthira, the eldest brother, was a good king. He ruled fairly and his brothers helped him. They were very happy together."

One day, a holy man named Narada visited them.  Yudhishthira offered him a seat and treated him with respect.  Then Yudhishthira sent a message to Draupadi to come and greet the holy man. Draupadi came, bowed respectfully, and then the holy man blessed her and asked her to leave.

After Draupadi left, Narada spoke to the Pandavas. He said, "Draupadi is married to all of you.  You must be careful!  Long ago, there were two brothers, Sunda and Upasunda.  They were very strong and powerful, but they fought and killed each other because of a beautiful woman named Tilottama."

Narada warned the Pandavas, "Learn from Sunda and Upasunda's mistake.  Don't let anything break your friendship."

Yudhishthira was curious. He asked, "Who were Sunda and Upasunda? Who was Tilottama? Tell us the whole story!"  And so, Vaisampayana began to tell the story of Sunda and Upasundaâ€¦
