Once upon a time, the gods decided to make Kartikeya their army leader.  Brihaspati, a wise priest, got everything ready for the big ceremony.  He lit a fire and poured special drinks on it.  Himavat, the king of the mountains, gave Kartikeya a beautiful seat covered in sparkly gems.

Lots and lots of gods came!  Indra, Vishnu, the sun and the moon, and many, many more.  Even the wind, fire, and rivers were there!  There were also friendly spirits like Gandharvas and Apsaras, and even some scary Rakshasas.  All the important people in the universe came to celebrate!

Everyone brought gifts for Kartikeya.  The gods poured special water on his head to make him the leader.  Brahma, the creator god, and Kasyapa, a powerful god, also poured water on Kartikeya's head.

Brahma then gave Kartikeya four strong and fast friends: Nandisena, Lohitaksha, Ghantakarna, and Kumudamalin.  Another god, Sthanu, gave him a super strong friend who could fight lots of enemies. This friend killed fourteen MILLION bad guys all by himself!

The gods gave Kartikeya their whole army. It was a huge, powerful army, ready to fight any enemy.  Everyone shouted, "Victory to Kartikeya!"

Yama, the god of death, gave Kartikeya two scary friends, Unmatha and Pramatha.  The sun god, Surya, gave him two more friends, and the moon god, Soma, gave him two more. Agni, the fire god, gave him two fiery friends. Many other gods gave Kartikeya their strongest warriors as friends.

Each god gave Kartikeya lots of new friends to help him lead the army.  Some of these friends were very strange!  Some had faces like animals, like dogs, tigers, or even birds!  Some had many heads or arms! Some had mouths in strange places, like on their stomachs or backs! They were all different colors and sizes. Some were tall and some were short! Some wore cool clothes, others wore leaves and bones!


They all looked very different, but they were all super strong and brave, ready to fight for Kartikeya.  They danced and celebrated around him, happy to be part of his amazing army. All the godsâ€™ friends were ready to fight for Kartikeya, from the sky, the air, and the ground. Thousands and millions of them came to help him.  They were a huge and powerful army, ready to do whatever Kartikeya asked them to do.  And so, Kartikeya was ready to lead the gods' army!
