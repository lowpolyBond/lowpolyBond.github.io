King Dhritarashtra was worried.  He looked at his huge army.  "Sanjaya," he said, "my army is amazing! It's strong, it's big, and it's full of brave soldiers.  They're all healthy and well-trained. They're experts with swords, spears, and elephants!  They're not just any soldiers; they're the best, from the best families.  They're paid well and happy to fight for me.  Many kings are fighting with us, too. My army is like a giant ocean!"

Dhritarashtra continued, "My army is like a huge ocean. The soldiers are the water, the horses are the waves, and the swords and spears are the oars.  Great heroes like Drona and Karna are like the strongest parts of the ocean. But even with all this,  Arjuna and his brother Bhima are cutting through my army like hot knives through butter! They are unstoppable!"

Dhritarashtra was very sad.  He said, "Arjuna and Bhima are so powerful, no one can stop them.  Even my best warriors are running away!  They are scared of Arjuna and Bhima! I don't know what will happen to my army!"

Sanjaya, his advisor, said, "King, don't be so sad.  You were warned not to fight the Pandavas. You didnâ€™t listen.  Krishna tried to make peace, but you refused.  This war is your own fault.  You should not blame Duryodhana. Now, let me tell you what happened in the battle."

Sanjaya described how, even though Kritavarman fought bravely for Dhritarashtra's army, Arjuna and Bhima, along with their friends, were too strong. Kritavarman, a very strong warrior, fought the Pandavas' side, almost winning against the entire army.  Bhima, Arjuna, and their friends threw many arrows. They fought back and forth bravely. Kritavarman was wounded, but he kept fighting. But eventually, even he couldn't stand against the Pandavas' power. The Pandavas' army won, and many soldiers ran away.  Sanjaya explained that it was Dhritarashtra's own mistakes that caused this huge loss.
