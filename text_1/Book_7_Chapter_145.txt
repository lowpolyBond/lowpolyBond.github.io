Sanjaya told the king, "Arjuna's bowstring twanged!  It sounded like a terrifying roar, even louder than a thunderstorm!  The king's army was terrified. They were like a stormy sea, all waves and fear!

Arjuna fought like a whirlwind. He was everywhere at once!  He shot arrows so fast, nobody could even see him pull them back, aim, or let them go!

Arjuna used a super-powerful weapon.  Thousands of fiery arrows flew from his bow, like a blazing sun! The sky was filled with them; it was too bright to look at!  He cleared away the darkness that the enemy's arrows had made, just like the sun chases away the night.

Arjuna's arrows were like a hot summer sun drying up a lake. They killed the king's soldiers one after another, just like insects flying into a flame!  He cut off heads, arms, and legs.  He was like Death himself! The battlefield was a terrible sight:  broken chariots, dead elephants, and piles of bodies. It looked like a scary river of blood, bones, and broken things. Even the bravest soldiers were too scared to look at him!

Arjuna wanted to kill Jayadratha. He was so amazing that nobody could even watch him fight.  He shot arrows everywhere, and the sky was filled with them.  He finally shot 46 arrows into Jayadratha!

But Jayadratha had a powerful father, King Vriddhakshatra.  A magical voice once said that Jayadratha would be a great warrior, but a powerful warrior would cut off his head in battle. The king made a promise: if anyone cut off Jayadratha's head, their own head would break into a hundred pieces!

Krishna, Arjuna's friend, knew this. He used magic to make it look like the sun had set.  Jayadratha, thinking it was night, relaxed.  Arjuna quickly cut off his head!

Krishna used his magic to make the head fly through the air, outside of the battlefield, and right onto his father's lap!  When Vriddhakshatra stood up, the head fell to the ground.  Just like the prophecy said, his head cracked into a hundred pieces!

When the darkness cleared, everyone knew Jayadratha was dead. The king's soldiers were very sad.  Arjuna kept fighting, defeating many more soldiers. The battle was terrible and scary.  Arjuna was a mighty warrior, even better than the gods!  The battlefield was full of death. Then the battle continued into the night!
