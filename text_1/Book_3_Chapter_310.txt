Once upon a time, the Pandava brothers – Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva – were lost in a big forest.  They were very thirsty.

Yudhishthira said, "Bad things happen, and sometimes we don't know why."  Bhima said, "Maybe this happened because I didn't stop a bad guy long ago!" Arjuna said, "Maybe it's because I didn't stand up to someone who was mean to me." Sahadeva said, "Maybe it's because I didn't stop Sakuni from cheating at the game!"

Yudhishthira told Nakula, "Climb that tree and look for water." Nakula climbed up and shouted, "I see trees near water! I hear cranes!"  Yudhishthira said, "Nakula, get some water using these quivers!"

Nakula found a beautiful lake.  A magical voice said, "Don't drink! Answer my questions first!" But Nakula was so thirsty, he drank and fell down dead.

Sahadeva went to get water next. The same voice warned him, but he drank too and died.

Arjuna went next. The voice warned him, but Arjuna said, "Show yourself! Fight me!" He shot many arrows but the voice only said, "Answer my questions, then drink!" Arjuna drank and also fell dead.

Finally, Bhima went.  The voice warned him again.  But Bhima, very thirsty, ignored it, drank, and died too.

Yudhishthira waited and waited. He wondered, "Where are my brothers? What happened?"  He went into the forest to look for them.  He was sad and worried.  He finally found the beautiful lake where his brothers had died.
