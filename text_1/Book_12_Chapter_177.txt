Once upon a time, a king named Yudhishthira asked a wise man, Bhishma, "If someone wants to be happy but doesn't have much money, what should they do?"

Bhishma smiled.  "A happy person sees good and bad things as the same," he said. "They don't worry about getting rich. They always tell the truth,  they don't cling to things, and they don't chase after things they want. These five things bring peace and happiness. They are like reaching heaven!"

Bhishma then told a story about a man named Manki. Manki really wanted to be rich. He tried and tried, but he always failed.  Finally, he bought two young oxen to help him farm. One day, the oxen got scared of a camel. They ran and got stuck on the camel's neck! The camel ran away, and Manki's oxen were in danger.

Manki watched, and said, "If it's not meant to be, I can't get rich, no matter how hard I try. I've tried so many ways before!  This is just fate.  Working hard doesn't always help if it's not meant to be."

He looked at his poor oxen, bouncing on the camel's neck.  "My poor oxen!  Everything is decided by fate.  What's the use of trying so hard?"

Manki learned a big lesson. He decided to stop wanting things so much. He said, "The person who gives up wanting things is happier than the person who gets everything they want.  You can never get everything you desire. Only people who aren't wise want to protect their bodies and lives so much."

Manki talked to himself. "My greedy heart, why can't you be still? You've lost so much wealth before! When will you stop wanting things? I'm a fool for listening to you! This is how people become slaves. Nobody ever gets everything they want."

He said, "Desire is like hard rock; even a hundred problems can't break it!  I know what you want, Desire. I'll find happiness within myself. Desire comes from wanting things, so I will stop wanting things.  Then you will disappear!"

Manki realized that wanting wealth only brings worry. If you get it, you worry about losing it. If you lose it, it's like dying.  It's always uncertain.  And even if you get it, you always want more!  It's like drinking sweet water; you just get thirstier.

Manki decided to change. "I'm awake now! Leave me, Desire!  I don't need anything else. I'll be kind to everyone and focus on being peaceful. I won't let you hurt me again!"

He said, "Losing wealth is really sad. People ignore you when you're poor. Rich people are often scared and even killed. I finally understand. Wanting wealth only brings sorrow."

Manki finally gave up wanting things. He became peaceful and happy. He helped others, and he was kind to everyone, even those who were mean to him. Because he stopped wanting things, Manki finally found true happiness. He was free!  He even became wise and lived a long happy life because of losing his oxen!
