Once upon a time, two wise men, Bhrigu and Bharadwaja, were talking about what happens after we die.

Bhrigu said, "When a living thing dies, it doesn't really disappear. It just changes into something else!  Think of a candle. When the candle burns out, the wax melts away, but the light is still there, just in a different form."

Bharadwaja wasn't sure. "But a flame goes out when it runs out of wax," he said.  "It's gone, isn't it?"

Bhrigu explained, "The flame doesn't disappear. It just mixes with the air. We can't see it anymore, but it's still there.  It's the same with living things.  When we die, our bodies disappear, but the life inside us, like a tiny flame, mixes with the air and moves on.  This flame is like heat that keeps us alive."

Bharadwaja still had questions. "If our bodies are made of earth, water, air, and fire, what is it that *feels* things? What makes us happy or sad?  What makes us think and talk?"

Bhrigu said, "There's something inside us, a tiny, unseen part called the Soul.  It's like a little spark of light. The Soul is in all living things. It sees, hears, smells, tastes and feels.  It's the part of us that thinks and remembers.  When the body is gone, the Soul goes on."

Bhrigu continued, "The Soul is part of everything, even the whole world!  It's like a tiny drop of water in a big lotus flower.  Sometimes, the Soul is covered with different feelings, like being happy, sad, or angry.  But it's always there, a tiny light inside you."

Bhrigu said that the Soul is always there and never really dies. It just moves on to a new form.  "Death is just the body breaking down," he said. "The Soul is always there. But only wise people can see the Soul."  He explained that we can find true happiness by being kind and focusing on our inner light.  That little spark, the Soul, is the most important part of all.
