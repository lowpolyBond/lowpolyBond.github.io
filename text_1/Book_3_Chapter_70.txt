Once upon a time, a wise man named Parnada traveled far and wide.  He went to find King Nala, Damayanti's husband.  He went to the city of Ayodhya, where King Rituparna lived.  Parnada told everyone about Damayanti's sadness because she hadn't seen Nala in a long, long time.  But nobody knew where Nala was.

Then, Parnada met Vahuka, King Rituparna's chariot driver. Vahuka was a kind man, even though he had short arms. He told Parnada a very important thing: "Even when a good wife is sad, she stays strong. She doesn't get angry at her husband if he's having hard times.  Nala might be having a really tough time. He needs kindness, not anger!"

Parnada rushed back to Damayanti with the news.  Damayanti was very sad but Vahuka's words made her think. She didn't want her father, King Bhima, to know what she was planning. So she secretly asked her mother for help.

Damayanti asked a very clever Brahmin, Sudeva, to go to Ayodhya.  She told Sudeva to tell King Rituparna that she was going to choose a new husband. She was worried because she didnâ€™t know if Nala was even still alive. She wanted to give Nala a chance to come back.

Damayanti also gave Sudeva a special message: "Tell Rituparna that I'm having another wedding ceremony tomorrow! Tell him to hurry if he wants to see me again."

Sudeva, like a bird flying straight to its nest, quickly flew to Ayodhya to deliver this very important message.  He was very speedy and wanted to make sure King Rituparna received the news before the wedding.
