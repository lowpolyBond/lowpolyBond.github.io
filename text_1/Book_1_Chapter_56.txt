Once upon a time, King Janamejaya was having a big fire sacrifice.  He wanted to punish a scary snake named Takshaka, who was his enemy.  A very wise young boy, Astika, was watching.

The king thought Astika was so smart he wanted to give him a present!  The wise men agreed that the boy deserved a gift.  But first, they needed Takshaka!

The king's helpers said Takshaka was hiding with the great god Indra, who was protecting him.  Even a wise man who knew lots of stories agreed.  Indra had given Takshaka a magic charm – the fire wouldn't hurt him!

The king was angry!  He told his helpers to make sure Takshaka came to the sacrifice, even if it meant bringing Indra too!

The helpers chanted magic words.  Suddenly, Indra arrived in his amazing chariot!  Gods and beautiful dancers surrounded him, but Takshaka was hiding in Indra’s clothes!

The king shouted, "Bring Takshaka to the fire, even if you have to bring Indra!" The helpers chanted louder, and  Indra, frightened by the powerful magic, dropped Takshaka!  Takshaka fell from the sky, scared and dizzy, towards the fire!

Just then, Astika spoke up.  "King," he said, "If you want to give me a gift, please stop the sacrifice and save Takshaka!"

The king was surprised.  He offered Astika gold, silver, and cows, but Astika only wanted the sacrifice to end so Takshaka would be safe.  The king tried to convince him to ask for something else, but Astika wouldn't change his mind.  Finally, everyone agreed: Astika's wish was granted. The sacrifice ended, and Takshaka was saved!
