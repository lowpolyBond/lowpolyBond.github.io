Bhishma, a great warrior, was fighting a long battle. He was fighting Rama, a very strong warrior too.  Bhishma couldn't win! That night, he prayed to the gods.

He went to sleep, feeling sad.  Then, he had a wonderful dream! Eight shining, kind Brahmins (wise men) surrounded him.

"Don't worry, Bhishma!" they said. "We'll help you. Rama can't defeat you!"

They told him about a special weapon, called Praswapa.  It was a secret weapon, and only Bhishma knew about it.  This weapon wouldn't kill Rama, it would just make him fall asleep.

Then, Bhishma would have another weapon called Samvodhana, to wake Rama up again.  It was like a magical sleepy-time and wake-up weapon!

The Brahmins said, "Use Praswapa. Rama will be asleep, and then you can win!"  Then, poof!  The Brahmins disappeared.

Bhishma woke up feeling hopeful. He knew exactly what to do!
