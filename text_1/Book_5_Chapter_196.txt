The sun rose after a long night.  The Kaurava brothers went to their grandfather, Bhishma.  "Grandpa," they asked, "The Pandavas have a HUGE army!  So many soldiers, elephants, and horses!  Strong warriors like Bhima and Arjuna are there, too! How long will it take you, and our other great warriors, to defeat them?"

Bhishma, a very strong warrior, answered, "You want to know how long it will take to defeat the Pandavas. That's a good question!  I can defeat their regular soldiers easily.  Against tricky fighters, I'll use clever tricks.  I can defeat ten thousand regular soldiers and one thousand chariot soldiers every day.  Wearing my armor, I can finish the whole army like that.  But if I use my strongest weapons, I can finish them all in just one month!"

Then, King Duryodhana asked Drona, their teacher, "Teacher, how long will it take *you* to defeat the Pandavas?"

Drona smiled and said, "I'm getting old, my strength isn't what it used to be.  But I can defeat them in a month, just like Bhishma."

Kripa said he could do it in two months.  Aswatthaman, Drona's son, said he could do it in ten nights!

Karna, a very brave warrior, boasted, "I can defeat them in just five days!"

Bhishma laughed when Karna said that. "That's only true," Bhishma said, "if you don't have to fight Arjuna!  Arjuna is very, very strong!"
