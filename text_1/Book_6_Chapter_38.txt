Once upon a time, Krishna, a wise teacher, explained something amazing to his friend Arjuna.  He said, "Arjuna, I'll tell you a secret about how the world works.  It's a super-special secret that helps people become free!"

Krishna explained that everything comes from him. He's like the seed that grows into all living things.  Brahma, the creator god, is like a big garden where Krishna plants the seeds.  From those seeds, all living creatures are born.

Krishna said there are three types of energy inside everyone: goodness, passion, and darkness.  Goodness feels good and makes you happy and smart.  Passion makes you want things, sometimes too much. Darkness makes you lazy and confused.

These energies are like ropes that can tie you down. Goodness ties you to happiness and knowledge. Passion ties you to wanting things and working hard. Darkness ties you to being sleepy and making mistakes.

If you have a lot of goodness, you’ll be happy and wise.  If you have a lot of passion, you’ll work hard, but might also feel stressed. If you have a lot of darkness, you’ll feel lazy and confused.

When you die, where you go next depends on which energy was strongest in you. If you had lots of goodness, you go to a wonderful place. If you had lots of passion, you'll be reborn to keep working. And if you had lots of darkness, you'll be reborn somewhere less happy.

Arjuna asked, "Krishna, how can I get free from these energies?"

Krishna smiled. "Arjuna," he said, "Someone who's free doesn't let these energies bother them. They're happy and calm no matter what happens. Good or bad, happy or sad, rich or poor – it all feels the same to them. They don't try too hard; they just focus on loving and worshipping me. Then they become completely free."

Krishna said that by loving and worshipping him, Arjuna could escape the ropes of goodness, passion, and darkness and become free like him, forever happy and at peace.
