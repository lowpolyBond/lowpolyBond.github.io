Once upon a time, a beautiful princess named Devasena lived in the mountains.  Her sister, Daityasena, had been taken away by a mean giant named Kesin.  Devasena was saved by a powerful god named Indra.  Devasena was grateful and asked Indra to find her a super strong husband!

Devasena said, "My husband must be so strong, he can beat anyone â€“ even giants and gods!"  Indra thought hard.  He couldn't find anyone strong enough!

Then, Indra looked at the sky. He saw the sun and the moon meeting. This was a very rare and powerful event. Indra thought, "Maybe a baby born from this special meeting could be strong enough!"

Indra went to the great god Brahma. He asked Brahma to help find a husband for Devasena. Brahma agreed. The special meeting of the sun and moon would create a powerful baby!

Indra and Devasena went to a special ceremony where many wise people made offerings to the gods.  The Adbhuta fire, a special sacred fire, carried these offerings to the gods in the sky.

On the way back, the Adbhuta fire saw beautiful women. He fell in love with them!  He was sad because he couldn't be with them. He decided to become their household fire, so he could be near them.

He stayed with the women for a long time. But they were happy with their husbands. The fire god was very sad.  He went into the forest because he was so heartbroken.

But then, another god, Swaha, loved the fire god!  She knew he was sad.  Swaha decided to trick him! She would pretend to be the wives he loved, to make him happy! And that's how the story goes...
