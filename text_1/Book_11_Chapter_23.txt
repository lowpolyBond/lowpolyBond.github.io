Gandhari was very sad.  She pointed to Shalya, Nakula's uncle.  "He's dead," she cried.  "Yudhishthira killed him! Shalya always boasted he was as strong as you, Krishna!"  Shalya, the king of Madra, lay still.  He had been Karna's chariot driver, but he tried to make Karna lose!  Now, crows were pecking at his beautiful face.  His golden skin was all torn.  Shalyaâ€™s sad wives cried around him, like elephants near their fallen leader.  

Then Gandhari showed them Bhagadatta, the king of the mountains. He was a great elephant fighter.  He lay dead, but his golden crown still shone, even though birds were eating his body.  He and Arjuna fought a terrible battle, like the god Indra fighting the demon Vritra!  Arjuna won.

Next, she pointed to Bhishma.  He was the greatest warrior ever!  Bhishma, the mighty son of Shantanu, lay there, like the sun falling from the sky at the end of the world.  He fought bravely, but he was killed.  He lay on a bed of arrows, like a god resting.  He was so wise and strong; no one was like him.  He even told the Pandavas how he would die! Bhishma, who kept the Kuru family strong, was gone.  Who would teach the Kurus about what is right now?

Gandhari then showed Drona, Arjuna's teacher.  He was a wise and powerful warrior, but he was dead too.  His weapons wouldn't listen to him at the end.  The Kauravas had depended on him to fight.  He was like a great fire, burning brightly, then suddenly gone dark. He still held his bow, but jackals were pulling at his feet. His heartbroken wife, Kripi, cried and cried beside him.  His students were sad, too. They prepared his funeral pyre, putting bows, arrows, and chariot pieces on it, and sang sad songs. They were burning him, along with his grief and sorrow. Then they carried Kripi away, leading the sad procession.
