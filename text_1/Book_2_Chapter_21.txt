Once upon a time, in the kingdom of Ayodhya, King Dasharatha, Rama's father, made a promise he couldn't keep.  His second wife, Kaikeyi, asked him to send Rama, his eldest son, to live in the forest for fourteen years, and to make Bharata, his younger son, king instead.

Lakshmana, Rama's loyal brother, was very upset.  He told their mother, Queen Kaushalya, "Mother, this isn't right! Rama is perfect! He's kind and brave. Why should he leave?"  Lakshmana was so angry, he even said he'd fight anyone who tried to stop Rama from becoming king! He promised to protect Rama, even if it meant fighting the whole kingdom!

Lakshmana then turned to Rama. "Brother," he said, "let's just become king now! I'll help you."

Queen Kaushalya cried. "My son," she pleaded, "don't leave me!  I'll die without you!"

Rama, though heartbroken, was a very good and obedient son. He told his mother, "I must follow my father's orders. It's the right thing to do." He explained that even great heroes in the past had obeyed their fathers, even if it was hard.

Rama tried to comfort his mother. "Mother," he said, "I'll come back after fourteen years. Please don't worry." He also told Lakshmana, "I know you're strong and want to help, but fighting isn't the answer.  Doing what's right is more important."

Queen Kaushalya was still very sad, but she knew Rama was doing what he believed was right. She hugged him tightly, and with tears in her eyes, she let him go.  Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana prepared to leave for the forest.  Though their hearts were heavy with sorrow, they knew they had to be brave and follow the path of dharma â€“ that is, doing what is right, even when it's difficult.
