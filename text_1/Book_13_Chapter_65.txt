Long ago, a wise man named Bhishma told a story.  He said a very smart man, Atri, once said that giving gold is like giving everything!

King Harischandra agreed. He said giving gold washes away bad things, helps you live a long life, and makes you very lucky.  Another wise man, Manu, said the best gift of all is water!  He said digging wells and lakes is wonderful.  If you dig a well where animals and good people can drink, you'll be less bad!  Your whole family will be safe, too.  If everyone can get water from your well, especially during hot weather, you'll be protected from trouble.

Giving ghee (like butter) is also amazing!  Bhishma said it makes the gods happy. Itâ€™s good medicine and important for ceremonies.  Giving ghee to good people makes you lucky and beautiful, keeps bad spirits away, and makes sure you never get thirsty. You'll always have everything you need!

If you give things to good people with a kind heart, you even get some of their good luck! Giving firewood helps them stay warm and cook food, which is also very good.  It makes you shine brighter than your enemies and keeps your cows safe!

Giving an umbrella is also great! It helps people stay dry, brings you lots of children and makes you super lucky! It even protects you from eye problems, and helps your prayers work better. Giving one during the rainy or sunny season keeps away sadness, and you'll always get what you need.

But the very best gift of all, said another wise man named Sandilya, is a chariot!
