Once upon a time, the world was on fire!  A powerful god, the Grandsire, was very, very angry.  His anger was like a giant fire, burning everything – plants, animals, even people!

A kind god named Sthanu was worried. He pleaded with the Grandsire, "Please, don't be angry!  You made all these creatures. They're burning up!"

The Grandsire explained, "I'm not angry, but the Earth is too crowded. She's asked me to help.  She's sinking under all the weight!"  He tried to think of a way to fix things but got even angrier!

Sthanu begged again, "Please, don't destroy everything!  All the animals, plants, and people will be gone forever!"

The Grandsire, hearing Sthanu's kind words, calmed down. He stopped the fire!  But because the world needed a balance, something needed to control how many creatures lived.

Then, from the Grandsire's body, a lady appeared. She was Death!  She had dark eyes and skin, and she wore beautiful jewelry.

The Grandsire said to Death, "Go and take the creatures from the world.  It’s needed to keep things in balance.”

But Death was sad! She didn't want to hurt anyone. She cried, but she held back her tears.  She wanted to be kind, not cruel.  She would still take creatures, but she would think carefully about how she did it.  And so, the world had both life and death, all thanks to the kind words of Sthanu and the thoughtful nature of Death.
