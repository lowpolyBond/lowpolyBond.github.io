Once upon a time, Princess Devayani, a beautiful girl with glowing skin, went for a walk in the woods.  She was with her servant, Sarmishtha, and a thousand other maids. They were having a wonderful time, eating sweet fruits and flowers.

Suddenly, King Yayati, a strong and handsome king, came by. He was tired and thirsty after hunting deer. He saw Devayani and her maids, all looking beautiful. Devayani was resting, and Sarmishtha was gently massaging her feet.

King Yayati politely asked their names. Devayani explained that she was the daughter of Sukra, a very important teacher, and Sarmishtha was her servant, the daughter of another king.

Yayati was surprised that Sarmishtha, who was also very pretty, was a servant. Devayani said it was just fate.  Yayati told her his name and that he was a king too. He said he was tired and thirsty after hunting.

Devayani smiled. She said, "Your kindness makes me happy. I wish you to be my husband."

Yayati was shocked. He said, "You are the daughter of a great teacher! I am not worthy of you." Devayani replied that it didn't matter.  But Yayati was worried about their different backgrounds. He didn't want to do anything wrong.

Devayani insisted. She said she only wanted him. Yayati worried that her father wouldn't approve. So, Devayani sent a messenger to her father, Sukra.

Sukra came and met Yayati. Yayati was very respectful. Devayani asked her father for permission to marry Yayati. Sukra agreed! He was happy that Devayani had found someone she loved.  But he also said that Yayati shouldn't marry Sarmishtha.

Yayati was very grateful. He happily married Devayani and took her, Sarmishtha, and all the maids back to his kingdom. Everyone was very happy!  He had a wonderful wife, but he had to remember Sukra's words about Sarmishtha.
