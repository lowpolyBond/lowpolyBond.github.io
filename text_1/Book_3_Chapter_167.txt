Arjuna, a brave warrior, spent the night praying to a powerful god.  In the morning, he told a wise Brahmin about meeting the great god Shiva.  The Brahmin smiled and said, "Because you saw the great god, you'll soon be friends with powerful gods in the sky, and the King of the Gods, Indra, will give you amazing weapons!"  The Brahmin then disappeared.

Suddenly, the air felt fresh and clean.  Beautiful flowers bloomed everywhere!  Music filled the air, and magical beings sang songs.  Then, chariots flew down from the sky, carrying many gods and goddesses!  Arjuna even saw the god of death, Yama!

All the gods cheered for Arjuna and said, "You’ve seen the great god Shiva, now we’ll give you powerful weapons!"  Arjuna bowed and gratefully accepted these amazing weapons.

Indra, the King of the Gods, then appeared in his shining chariot.  He told Arjuna, "I knew you were coming!  You’ve worked hard, now you’ll go to heaven!  My chariot driver, Matali, will take you."

Arjuna asked Indra to teach him how to use the weapons.  Indra agreed, saying, "You'll do great things with these weapons, but only use them when you really need to, and never against ordinary people."  Then Indra said, "I'll teach you to use every kind of weapon!"  And poof! Indra disappeared.

Matali, Indra's driver, arrived in a magnificent chariot pulled by magical horses.  Matali was amazed at how steady Arjuna sat in the chariot—even the gods bounced around!  Matali flew Arjuna through the sky, showing him beautiful palaces, gardens, and the homes of the gods.  He showed Arjuna the amazing city of Amaravati, where there's no heat, cold, or tiredness!

Arjuna met many powerful gods and goddesses. They blessed him, wishing him strength and victory.  Then he went to see Indra. Indra happily shared his throne with Arjuna!  Arjuna became friends with Chitrasena, who taught him special magical skills.  Arjuna spent time in heaven, learning new skills, listening to music, and watching beautiful dances.  He practiced hard with his new weapons.

When Arjuna was finally very skilled, Indra patted him on the head and said, "Arjuna, you're now so strong, even the gods can't defeat you!  But you need to earn your place here. You must defeat my enemies, the Nivata-Kavachas, who are terrible monsters living in the ocean.”

Indra gave Arjuna a magnificent chariot, special armor, and a powerful shell to use as a weapon. The gods cheered him on, wishing him luck.  Arjuna, ready for battle, set off in his chariot towards the ocean to fight the Nivata-Kavachas.
