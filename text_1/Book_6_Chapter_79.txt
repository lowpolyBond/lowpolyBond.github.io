Once upon a time, during a great battle, Abhimanyu, a brave young warrior, fought alongside his uncle Bhima.  They were surrounded by the Kaurava army, including Duryodhana and his brothers.  Many Kaurava soldiers attacked Abhimanyu and Bhima.

Abhimanyu was super strong! He shot many arrows. He even defeated Vikarna, a powerful warrior, by shooting twenty-five arrows at his chariot!  Vikarna had to quickly switch chariots.  Then, Duryodhana and Vikarna fought back, hitting Abhimanyu with arrows. But Abhimanyu stood strong, like a mountain!

The Pandavas' sons also fought bravely. They attacked Duryodhana, hitting him with arrows. Duryodhana fought back, too.  The battle was fierce!  It was like a big, bloody ocean.  Broken chariots were like boats, and elephants were like islands.  Lots of brave soldiers were hurt and lying on the ground.

Even the great warrior Bhishma fought for the Kauravas. Arjuna, Abhimanyu's father, joined the battle, too.  His bow, Gandiva, made a loud twang as he fought.  There were so many dead soldiers that the battlefield was covered in bodies!  Everyone fought hard, wanting to win!  It was a truly amazing and terrible battle.
