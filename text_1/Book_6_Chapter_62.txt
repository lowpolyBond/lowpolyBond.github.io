King Dhritarashtra was sad.  He was watching the battle from afar.  His son Duryodhana's army was losing badly.  His messenger, Sanjaya, kept telling him how the Pandavas were winning and his soldiers were losing.  Dhritarashtra felt terrible. He asked Sanjaya, "How can we win?  It seems impossible!"

Sanjaya said, "King, the battle is fierce!  It's your own choices that have led to this. Listen closely!"

He told Dhritarashtra about a big fight.  Dhrishtadyumna and Salya, two great warriors, fought bravely. They shot many arrows at each other.  Then Abhimanyu, another strong warrior, joined the fight.  He helped Dhrishtadyumna.

Many of Dhritarashtra's sons – Duryodhana, Dusshasana, and others – fought against the Pandavas. Ten warriors from each side fought a huge battle.  They all fought very hard, shooting arrows and shouting. Duryodhana and his brothers even hit Dhrishtadyumna with many arrows. But Dhrishtadyumna and Abhimanyu fought back with even more arrows!

Then, Bhima, another Pandava warrior, entered the fight. He was incredibly strong. He picked up his big mace.  Seeing Bhima's powerful mace, Duryodhana's army was scared. Duryodhana ordered his ten thousand elephants to charge!

Bhima jumped down from his chariot.  He roared like a lion! With his mighty mace, he smashed elephants left and right.  He was so strong, he broke elephants' tusks and bones with just one swing! The other Pandavas helped Bhima, shooting arrows to protect him.  The battlefield was full of broken elephants and dead soldiers.  It was a terrible, bloody sight!

Even the king of Magadha, who rode a huge elephant, was killed by Abhimanyu.  Bhima continued to crush the elephants, and he was so powerful, he seemed like a god of destruction.  The elephants ran away, causing even more trouble for Duryodhana's army. Finally, Bhima stood there, looking like a powerful hero.  The battle was still raging, but the Pandavas were winning.
