Once upon a time, there was a great king named Paurava.  He was a very brave and generous king.  Narada, a wise storyteller, told a tale about him.

King Paurava loved to give things away!  He gave away thousands and thousands of beautiful white horses.  He held big ceremonies called sacrifices.  Many, many wise priests came from faraway lands.  They were very happy because King Paurava gave them lots of wonderful gifts:  fine clothes, beautiful houses, comfy beds, fancy carpets, chariots, and even animals to help them work!  He even hired actors, dancers, and singers to entertain them.

At his sacrifices, King Paurava gave away ten thousand shining golden elephants!  He gave away golden chariots with flags waving high. He even gave away thousands and thousands of beautiful girls with golden jewelry! He gave away many other things too:  cars, horses, elephants to ride, houses, fields, and hundreds of thousands of cows and cowherds with gold necklaces.

People still tell stories about his amazing sacrifices! They say he gave away cows with golden horns and silver hooves, and even slaves and camels and sheep – so many he couldn’t count them all!  He gave away piles and piles of food and precious jewels.  King Paurava was very good at performing these special ceremonies, and he always did them in the right way.

Sadly, even great kings like Paurava die one day.  Narada told Srinjaya this story to remind him not to be so sad about his son’s death.  Srinjaya’s son wasn't as kind and generous as King Paurava.  He never did such wonderful things. So, Narada said, there was no need to cry so much.
