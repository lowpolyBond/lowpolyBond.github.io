Arjuna, a very strong warrior, went on a long journey. He visited many special places near the ocean.  He saw beautiful rivers and lakes.  He even went to a holy place called Prabhasa.

Krishna, Arjuna's best friend, heard about his travels.  Krishna rushed to see Arjuna and give him a big hug! They were such good friends, like brothers!  Krishna asked Arjuna why he was traveling so much.

Arjuna told Krishna all about his adventures.  Krishna said, "That sounds like a great trip!"

Then, Krishna and Arjuna went to a mountain called Raivataka.  Krishna had made it super pretty for Arjuna, with lots of delicious food and fun entertainers!  They watched dancers and actors.  Arjuna felt so relaxed, he fell asleep on a comfy bed!

He woke up to beautiful music!  After getting ready, Krishna greeted him warmly. They got on a shiny golden chariot and went to Dwaraka, Krishna's city.

The whole city was decorated for Arjuna's arrival!  Everyone wanted to see him.  The streets were full of people!  Lots of men and women came to greet him.  Arjuna hugged all his friends and was welcomed with great joy.

He went to Krishnaâ€™s amazing house, full of sparkling gems and wonderful things.  Arjuna stayed there with Krishna for many happy days.
