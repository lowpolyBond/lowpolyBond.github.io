King Yudhishthira was very wise. He asked, "I have power and riches and a long life. But how can I escape death?  Can I escape growing old and dying by praying, doing good deeds, studying holy books, or taking medicine?"

A great warrior named Bhishma knew the answer. He told a story about a wise man named Panchasikha and King Janaka.  King Janaka asked Panchasikha, "How can I escape growing old and dying? Is it by prayer, good deeds, or studying holy books?"

Panchasikha said, "No one can escape growing old and dying.  It's like a river.  We all float along the river of time.  Old age and death are like big crocodiles in that river. They catch everyone.  We meet friends and family along the way, but theyâ€™re only with us for a little while, just like clouds bumping into each other.  Old age and death eat everyone, big or small, strong or weak.

Only our souls live forever. So why be sad when someone is born or dies? We should ask ourselves: Where did I come from? Who am I? Where will I go?  Don't worry about growing old and dying. Instead, be a good person, help others, and live a good life."
