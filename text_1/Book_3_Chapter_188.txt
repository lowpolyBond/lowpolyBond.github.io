Once upon a time, a wise man named Markandeya met a powerful god.  This god was amazing! He said, "Even the other gods don't really know me! But I like you, so I'll tell you my secret: I made everything!"

The god explained, "I am Narayana, the home of the waters.  I am the beginning and the end of all things. I am Vishnu, Brahma, and Indra, the king of the gods! I am Yama, the god of death, and Shiva, and many more! I am everything!"

He showed Markandeya how he created the world.  "The earth is my feet, the sun and moon are my eyes, and the sky is my head," he said.  "I made the people – Brahmins, warriors, merchants, and workers – from different parts of my body.  I created the Vedas, the holy books, too!"

The god continued, "I am like the fire, the wind, and the sun.  The stars are my skin pores! The ocean is my home, and even your feelings – happiness, anger, fear – are all parts of me."

He also told Markandeya that he takes different forms to help people. When bad things happen, he comes back to make things right.  He changes color – white, yellow, red, or dark – depending on the time period. And sometimes, he even sleeps for a very, very long time!

Then, the god showed Markandeya the whole universe inside his own belly! It was amazing! Then, *poof!* the god disappeared.

Markandeya saw the world being reborn.  He remembered that the great god he'd met was Krishna, a very important person, the protector of everyone!  He told the Pandava brothers and Draupadi about the amazing god, and they all bowed down to Krishna to ask for his help and protection.  Krishna, kind and strong, made them feel better.
