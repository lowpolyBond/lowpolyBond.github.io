Once upon a time, a princess from Kasi was very, very angry with Bhishma. Bhishma had stopped her from getting married.  The princess was so mad, she decided to become a super strong warrior and defeat Bhishma!

She went to live with some wise holy people.  They asked her, "Why are you here?"

The princess said, "Bhishma ruined my life! I want to defeat him! I'll do anything to get revenge!"

Then, a powerful god appeared!  He was Shiva, the god with the bull. The princess asked him to help her defeat Bhishma. Shiva promised, "You will defeat him!  And you'll even become a man!"

But the princess worried, "How can I fight if I'm a woman?"

Shiva smiled, "Don't worry! You'll be reborn as a brave warrior, strong and skilled with weapons. You'll remember everything!"

The princess was so happy! To show how serious she was, she built a huge bonfire.  She jumped into the flames, shouting, "I'm doing this to defeat Bhishma!"

And that's how the princess, fueled by anger and with the help of a god, became destined to fight Bhishma! She would be reborn as a strong warrior, ready for battle.
