Once upon a time, King Drupada's wife had a baby.  She was worried because she already had no sons, and her other wives might tease her. So, she told the king the baby girl was a boy! King Drupada, who loved his wife very much, agreed. They pretended Sikhandini was a son, doing everything a son would do, even marrying her off to the king of the Dasarnakas' daughter.

But then, a big problem arose! The Dasarnakas king was angry and wanted to fight.  King Drupada and his queen were very sad. They prayed to the gods for help, and the queen told the king to ask the gods for help and to make peace.

Sikhandini felt very bad seeing her parents so worried. She thought, "It's all my fault!" She was so upset, she ran away into a dark forest.  This forest was scary because a powerful Yaksha, a nature spirit named Sthunakarna, lived there.

Sikhandini found an old house in the forest and didn't eat for many days.  Sthunakarna, the Yaksha, found her. He was kind and asked, "Why are you so sad? Tell me, and I will help!"

Sikhandini explained everything.  She told the Yaksha about the angry king, and about how her father was in danger. She asked the Yaksha for help, saying, "Please, help me become a man!  Then maybe this war will stop.‚Äù The Yaksha, who could grant wishes, promised to help her.  He would make her strong and brave, a warrior to protect her family and her kingdom.
