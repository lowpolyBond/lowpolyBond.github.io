Once upon a time, in the land of Bharat, King Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, a very important question.  He wanted to know about people born into mixed families.  Sometimes, people married outside their own group, and Yudhishthira wanted to know what rules were for their children.

Bhishma explained that a long time ago, the world was divided into four main groups: Brahmins (priests), Kshatriyas (warriors), Vaishyas (farmers and merchants), and Shudras (workers).  Each group had its own jobs and rules.

Bhishma said that if a Brahmin married outside his group, his children's place in society depended on their mother's group. A Brahmin's child with a Shudra woman, for example, would be considered lower in status.  This child had to serve his father's family.

Kshatriyas (warriors) could marry within their group or one below, but a child with a Shudra woman would also be lower in status.  Vaishyas could marry within their group or with a Shudra. Only Shudras could only marry other Shudras.

If someone from a lower group married someone from a higher group, their child was considered outside the main four groups. For example, a child of a Shudra and a Brahmin woman was a Chandala, a very low status person who worked as a public executioner. Other children of mixed marriages had other jobs: some were singers, some made nets, some were carpenters. There were many different mixed groups, more than fifteen!

Yudhishthira then asked how you could tell if someone was from a mixed family, because sometimes it was hard to know.  Bhishma explained that while some mixed-caste people looked respectable, their jobs and the stories of their families often told the truth about their origins.

Bhishma added that even though these mixed-caste people often had hard jobs and low status, they could still be good people.  He said that being kind, honest, and brave was more important than your family background.  He also warned that sometimes strong feelings, like lust, can lead to bad choices.  It was always best to follow the rules of society and make good choices when choosing a partner and starting a family.
