Once upon a time, there was a princess named Draupadi.  She was beautiful and strong.  Many kings wanted to marry her.  But first, they had to pass a test! They had to string a very, very strong bow.

Lots and lots of strong kings tried.  They were mighty warriors, but none could even bend the bow.  Then, a young man named Arjuna stepped forward. He looked like a prince, but he wasn't a king. He was a Brahmin, someone who studied religion.

Some people whispered, "He's too young! He's not a warrior! He'll fail!"  Others said, "Look at him! He's strong and brave. Maybe he can do it!"

Arjuna walked up to the bow.  He closed his eyes and thought of the gods. Then, *whoosh*!  He strung the bow easily!  It was like magic!

Next, he had to shoot an arrow through a tiny hole.  He did it perfectly!  Everyone cheered! Flowers rained down from the sky!  The music played loud and joyful.  The kings who had failed felt sad.

Arjuna had won! He married the beautiful princess Draupadi.  Everyone was happy for him.  He showed them that even a young Brahmin could be strong and brave. And that’s the story of how Arjuna won Draupadi’s hand in marriage.
