Once upon a time, a wise king named Yudhishthira wanted to hear a story. He asked Bhishma, a great warrior, about Suka, the son of the very wise Vyasa.  Yudhishthira was curious: how did Suka learn to give up all worldly things?

Bhishma said, "Suka lived like other people, enjoying life.  But Vyasa, his father, knew better.  He taught Suka everything in the holy books, the Vedas. Then he talked to Suka."

Vyasa said to Suka, "My son, learn to control yourself. Control your feelings—even when you are very hot or very cold, very hungry or very thirsty.  Be honest and kind. Don't be angry or mean. Be patient and helpful.  Live simply.  Only eat what’s left after you’ve fed the gods and your guests. Your body is like a bubble—it will disappear. Your soul is like a bird on a tree; it’s not attached to the tree. Everything good in this life is short.  Why are you wasting your time? Your enemies are always watching!  Every day that passes is one day closer to your death. Why don’t you learn how to prepare for what comes after?”

Vyasa continued, "People who only care about this life, about food and pleasure, are foolish. They ignore what happens after death.  They hate being good. Don't be like them!  Find wise teachers and listen to them.  Control your heart; don’t let it lead you astray. This world is just a test.  Imagine yourself as a worm trapped in a cocoon. You must escape! Use the raft of Yoga (the practice of controlling your mind and body) to cross the ocean of the world. This ocean is full of dangers:  Desire, Anger, and Death itself!  Use the raft of Righteousness to cross the river of life, which is full of storms and dangers. Death is always near, like a wolf waiting to snatch a lamb. Death will catch you if you are busy getting rich and having fun. When death comes, you need the bright light of goodness to guide you.  It’s very hard to become a good person, a Brahmin. You are a Brahmin now; don't waste it!  Brahmins don't live just for pleasure. They practice self-control. This brings happiness after death.  Your life is like a fast horse, running towards the end.  Each second is like a hair on its body. Every day and night makes the horse run closer to the end.  If you see this, you will turn to goodness.

People who are bad will go to a bad place after death. They will suffer. A good king who helps everyone will go to a good place. Doing good things brings great happiness, happiness that lasts longer than many lifetimes. Bad people, who disobey their parents and teachers, will be attacked by scary animals and insects in the afterlife. Those who lie and cheat will suffer terrible punishments – they’ll bathe in hot water, walk through a forest of sharp leaves, and sleep on a bed of axes! You only see the good things, but you’re blind to the most important thing: escaping suffering. Don't wait!  Death is coming! You will stand before Yama, the god of death.  Prepare for that! Your body will get weak and sick. Your enemies (your own desires!) will trick you.  Get the true treasure: goodness! This treasure can’t be stolen, not even by death.  It’s yours alone.  Give to others so they can have a good afterlife, too.  Don’t wait until you’re old to focus on the good life, you may die before you’re ready. No one goes with you to the next world, only your actions. Your riches mean nothing in the afterlife.  Even your family can’t come with you.  The sun, the wind, and fire watch everything you do. Every day and night is another step closer to your end. You must follow the path of your religion.

The road to the afterlife is dangerous, full of scary creatures.  Be careful what you do.  Each person is responsible for their own actions. Good people ride beautiful carts in the afterlife, bad people suffer.  You are twenty-five years old; your life is passing quickly.  The evil inside you wants to destroy your goodness. Do your duty before it’s too late.  When you must go alone, what use are your body, wife, and children?  Yama will take your friends and family. No one can stop him.  Follow these teachings; they are from the holy books.  Support your life in the way your religion teaches. Giving gifts helps to remove bad karma. Knowledge from the holy books leads to wisdom.  The pleasures of life are like a strong rope, but good people break free. Bad people can’t.  What use is your wealth, your family, your children?  They will not help you. Your ancestors are gone; do what you must now. Don't wait! Death doesn't wait. Your family will leave you behind at death. Avoid bad people. Search for your true self. Everyone is reborn based on their actions. Even the friends of rich people abandon them when they become poor. People do bad things for their families, causing suffering for themselves.  See the world as a place where you must choose good or bad actions,  and choose wisely!  What good is wealth you don't share? What good is strength you don't use to fight your enemies? What good is knowledge if it doesn't help you do good? What good is your soul if you let your senses control you?

After Vyasa spoke, Suka left his father to find a teacher who could show him how to reach enlightenment."
