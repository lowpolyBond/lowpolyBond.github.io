Once upon a time, during a great war, a brave warrior named Bhishma wanted to teach everyone about doing what's right.  He was very strong and wise.  He said, "I know all about doing the right thing. I'll happily answer any questions Yudhishthira has."  Yudhishthira was a kind and good king, but he felt very sad because of the war. He was worried he had done wrong things.

Bhishma, who was very powerful, knew all about what kings should do. He knew that kings and warriors had a special duty. He said, "A warrior's job is to fight when it is right, even if it means fighting against family.  Sometimes, even if someone is a teacher or relative, you need to fight them if they are wrong." Bhishma explained that a warrior should fight bravely and protect what is right, even if it meant making a battlefield look scary. He compared it to a lake of blood, with fallen warriors as grass and elephants as rocks! He said a warrior who fights for what is right earns great honour.

But Yudhishthira was very scared. He felt ashamed because he'd hurt many people, including family and friends, in the war.  He was afraid Bhishma might be angry.  Bhishma saw how sad Yudhishthira was. He was kind and said, "Don't be afraid, Yudhishthira. Ask me anything.  I'm here to help." Yudhishthira felt much better and sat down to ask Bhishma his questions.
