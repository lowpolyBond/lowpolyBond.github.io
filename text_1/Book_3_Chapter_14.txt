Yudhishthira asked Krishna, "Krishna, where were you?  What were you doing?"

Krishna answered, "King Yudhishthira, I was busy destroying a bad king named Salwa!  You see, I had to kill Sisupala, a very mean king, at your big party.  Salwa was Sisupala's friend. He was very angry!

He came to my city, Dwaraka, while I was away with you.  He was in a shiny, magical chariot. He fought with my friends and wrecked all our gardens.

He shouted, 'Where's Krishna? I'll fight him! I'll defeat him! He killed my brother unfairly!'  Salwa was so angry and loud! He flew around in his chariot looking for me.

When I got back, I heard all about Salwa's meanness.  I was very angry too! I decided to stop him. I looked for Salwa everywhere. Finally, I found him on a faraway island in the sea.

I blew my magic conch shell, Panchajanya. I challenged Salwa to a fight! I fought many other bad guys too, before I fought Salwa. That's why I was away!

As soon as I heard about your problems with the dice game in Hastinapur, I came here to help!"
