The Pandavas, five brave brothers, lived in the mountains for a whole year!  They ate like the wise holy men – fruits, berries, and deer meat they hunted with their arrows (no poison!). They also enjoyed lots of yummy honey.  They listened to stories from a wise old man named Lomasa.  Their friend Ghatotkacha, a powerful Rakshasa (a type of magical being), had already left, promising to return if needed.

One day, a giant bird called Suparna snatched a huge snake from a lake. The whole mountain shook!  Amazingly, beautiful five-colored flowers rained down from the sky.  Krishna, a good friend of the Pandavas, said to Bhima, the strongest brother, "Look!  These flowers are falling near the Aswaratha River.  Remember how you, Bhima, were so brave, fighting all those enemies before? Your strength scares even the Rakshasas!  If you show them your power, they’ll leave the mountain, and we can enjoy these pretty flowers in peace."

Bhima felt a little ashamed, like he hadn't been brave enough.  He was a super strong guy – big and strong like a bull or a lion! He grabbed his bow, sword, and mace (a big heavy club) and stormed up the mountain.  He was so strong, he climbed a super steep path all by himself!

From the top, he saw Vaisravana’s magical city! It was made of gold and jewels, sparkly and beautiful, with lots of dancing girls and flags waving in the wind. It was awesome!  Bhima blew his shell horn, making the Rakshasas jump! They charged at him with their swords, clubs and spears.  But Bhima was too strong! He fought bravely, hitting the Rakshasas with his arrows and mace, until they all ran away!

One brave Rakshasa named Maniman stayed to fight Bhima.  They battled with their weapons. Maniman hit Bhima's arm, but Bhima, with a mighty roar, knocked him down with his mace!  When Maniman was defeated, the rest of the Rakshasas ran away, screaming.  Bhima and his brothers had won! They could finally enjoy the beautiful mountain and those amazing flowers!
