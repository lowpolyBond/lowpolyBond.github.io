King Dhritarashtra was worried. He asked his friend Sanjaya, "Sanjaya, have you heard about Krishna? He’s amazing!  He did things nobody else ever could!"

When Krishna was a little boy, living with cowherds, he was already super strong. He defeated a scary forest monster named Hayaraja, who was as fast as the wind and as strong as a magical horse!

As a child, Krishna also fought a giant bull-like monster that was hurting cows. He bravely beat a bunch of other mean giants, too: Pralamba, Naraka, Jambha, Pitha, and Mura.  He even defeated the powerful King Kansa, who had lots of friends trying to protect him!

Krishna also fought and won against many other kings. He even beat King Sunaman, Kansa's brother, in a big battle.  He was so brave, he even took a princess away from angry kings!  They tried to stop him, but he just tied them to his wedding chariot!

Krishna was super strong! He threw a giant floating city into the sea! He beat lots of armies, from all over the land – the Angas, the Vangas, the Kalingas, and many more! He even fought and won against the god of the ocean, Varuna!  He got a magical conch shell from a monster in the underworld, and a powerful fire weapon from the god of fire. He even got a special flower from heaven!

Sanjaya, "Nobody could beat Krishna in a fight. Even when I saw him, he was like a god!"  Dhritarashtra said sadly,  "Krishna’s friends, the Pandavas, are going to fight my sons, the Kauravas. The Pandavas have Krishna, and he is so strong!"

"Krishna's best friend, Arjuna, is like an unstoppable warrior. With Krishna on their side, the Pandavas will win!"

Dhritarashtra worried, "If Krishna fights for the Pandavas, my sons will lose! My strong warriors, Bhishma and Drona, are already gone!  It's all my fault! I'm so scared.  Tell me, Sanjaya, what happened in the battle?  It’s all so terrible."
