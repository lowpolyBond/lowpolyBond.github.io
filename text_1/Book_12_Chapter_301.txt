Once upon a time, in the great land of Bharat, a wise king named Yudhishthira asked his grandfather, Bhishma, a very, very wise man, about two different ways of thinking: Sankhya and Yoga.

Yudhishthira said, "Grandpa, what's the difference between Sankhya and Yoga?"

Bhishma smiled.  "Some people like Sankhya," he said, "and others like Yoga.  Both groups think their way is best!  Those who like Yoga believe you need to believe in God to be happy forever. Those who like Sankhya believe that learning everything helps you be happy forever after you die."

"But Grandpa," Yudhishthira wondered, "if both ways lead to happiness, why are they so different?"

Bhishma explained, "Imagine a fish trapped in a net.  Yoga is like a strong fish breaking free.  To do that, you need to be strong and get rid of bad feelings like anger, greed, and selfishness. If you’re a weak fish, you stay trapped."

He continued, "It’s like a fire. A small fire goes out easily, but a big, strong fire burns bright. A strong person practicing Yoga can overcome any challenge."  A strong Yoga person is like a strong elephant that can swim against a big river, while a weak person gets swept away.

Bhishma said, "Yoga uses your senses. Sankhya uses old books. I like both!  Both teach goodness, kindness, and being true to your word.  They just talk about it in different ways."

Yudhishthira asked, "So if they're both good, why do they have different rules?"

Bhishma answered, "Yoga says to get rid of bad feelings: anger, selfishness, and lust.  It's like escaping a net! Yoga teaches you to focus your mind, like aiming an arrow at a target, or carrying a full pot of water up stairs without spilling it."

He went on to explain that Yoga also means following special rules.  "Yogins eat simple foods, like rice and barley, and they learn to control their minds and bodies.  They practice controlling their feelings like anger, and they learn to be still and calm. It's very, very hard work."  It's like walking through a dangerous jungle full of thorns and snakes.

Bhishma said, "Only a few people can do it, but those who do become very strong. They can even become one with God!"  He ended by saying that the best Yogins think about God all the time, and that God is in everything.
