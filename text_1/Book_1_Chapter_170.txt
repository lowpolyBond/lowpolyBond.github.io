Once upon a time, the Pandava brothers – Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva – were staying with a kind Brahmin.  A wise Brahmin told them something that made them all sad.  They felt like someone had thrown sharp sticks at their hearts!

Their mother, Kunti, saw how unhappy her sons were.  She said, "My dear Yudhishthira, we've been here a long time. We've seen all the beautiful forests and gardens around here. We don't want to stay here anymore. It's getting hard to get food.  Let's go to Panchala! We've heard it's a wonderful place, with lots of food and a kind king who helps Brahmins.  It's always good to travel and see new places."

Yudhishthira, the oldest brother, replied, "Mother, I always listen to you.  Your ideas are always the best. But I need to ask my brothers if they want to go to Panchala too."
