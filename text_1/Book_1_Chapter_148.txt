The Pandava brothers came to Varanavata!  Everyone was so happy to see them.  Thousands of people came out to greet them with gifts and cheers.  Yudhishthira, the oldest brother, looked as strong and handsome as the king of the gods!

The Pandavas visited everyone in the town – the priests, the officials, and even the regular people.  Then, Purochana, a man who worked for their enemy, Duryodhana, took them to their new palace.  It was beautiful, with yummy food and comfy beds.

The brothers lived in the palace for ten nights. Then Purochana showed them around their "blessed" home. But Yudhishthira, who was very clever, smelled something fishy!  The house smelled like melted butter and wax.  He noticed it was made of very flammable materials like hemp, straw, and bamboo, all soaked in butter!

“Bhima,” Yudhishthira said, “This house is a trap!  Duryodhana wants to burn us alive!”  He explained that Vidura, their wise uncle, had warned them about this.

Bhima wanted to leave right away.  But Yudhishthira had a plan. "We'll pretend everything is fine," he said. "But we need to be careful and find a secret way out."

He worried that if they ran, Duryodhana would find them and kill them.  Duryodhana was powerful and had lots of friends and money.  So, Yudhishthira decided they would secretly dig a tunnel under their room to escape!  They would also go hunting in the forest to learn the land and escape easily if needed.  They would keep their plan a secret from everyone, even Purochana and the people of Varanavata.  They would be safe!
