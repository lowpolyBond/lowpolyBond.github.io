Once upon a time, the Pandava brothers lived in a forest.  They were very clean and waited patiently for six nights to see their friend, Arjuna.

Suddenly, a wind blew from the northeast.  It carried a beautiful, sunny-yellow lotus flower with a thousand petals!  Draupadi, the Pandavas' wife, found it.  She was so happy!

"Bhima," she said, "look at this amazing flower! It smells wonderful. I want to give it to Yudhishthira, our oldest brother. Please find more flowers like this so I can take them back to our home!"

Strong Bhima, Draupadi's husband, agreed. He set off, following the wind, to find more flowers.  He carried his shiny gold bow and arrows that looked like poisonous snakes. He was strong and brave, like a roaring lion or a charging elephant!  Everyone watched him go.

Bhima wasn't tired or scared. He climbed a huge, beautiful mountain.  It was full of colorful plants, animals, and birds. It even had sparkling rocks and amazing waterfalls!  He smelled the sweet scents of many different flowers.

The mountain was home to magical beings like Yakshas and Gandharvas.  Peacocks danced, and the air was fresh and cool.  Bhima felt strong and happy.

As Bhima walked, he worried about his brothers, Yudhishthira, Nakula, and Sahadeva.  He wondered if they were okay alone.  He needed to find those flowers quickly!

He walked so powerfully that the ground shook!  Elephants, lions, tigers, deer â€“ all the animals were scared of his loud roars! They ran away or hid. But Bhima kept going, searching for more flowers.

Then, Bhima found a huge banana tree, taller than many trees put together! He pulled down tons of bananas and made even more noise!  He saw a big lake and splashed around in it, having fun.

After playing, Bhima blew a loud horn.  He even hit his arms together, making a huge booming sound!  The mountain echoed with the noise.  All the animals were very frightened.

Suddenly, a giant monkey, Hanuman, blocked Bhima's path. He was so big, he looked like a mountain himself!  Hanuman was sleepy and was snoring loudly.  His tail was so long, it shook the whole mountain!

Bhima saw the enormous monkey and yelled. Hanuman woke up and told Bhima to stop.  He said the path led to heaven and was only for magical creatures.  Hanuman asked Bhima to be kind to all living things, and to rest and eat some fruit instead of continuing on his dangerous journey.

So Bhima learned that even the strongest warrior needs to listen to wise advice!  And he learned that kindness and respect were also very important.
