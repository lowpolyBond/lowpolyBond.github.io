Once upon a time, a king named Bhagiratha wanted to help his ancestors.  They were trapped!  He asked a powerful god, Shiva, for help.  Shiva agreed.  He promised to help guide the heavenly river Ganga down to Earth.

Shiva went to a snowy mountain.  He told Bhagiratha to pray to Ganga, the river goddess.  Bhagiratha prayed, and Ganga heard him!  She rushed down from the sky!

Whoosh!  Ganga tumbled down, a giant, swirling river! Gods, magical creatures, and even snakes watched in awe.  She splashed and roared, her water foamy and white.  She looked like a happy, bubbly woman rushing to a party!

Ganga landed and asked Bhagiratha, "Where should I go?"  Bhagiratha showed her the place where his ancestors were trapped.  Ganga's water flowed over them, freeing them.

Shiva, happy to have helped, went back to his home.  Bhagiratha, with Ganga flowing beside him, reached the ocean.  The ocean filled up quickly! Bhagiratha even adopted Ganga as his daughter! He poured water on the ground to remember his ancestors.  Finally, everything was okay!

That's how the great river Ganga came to Earth.  And that's just one part of a really long story!
