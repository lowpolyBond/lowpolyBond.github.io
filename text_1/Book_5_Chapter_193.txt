King Drupada was in big trouble!  His brother, King Hiranyavarman, was very angry.  A messenger had told Hiranyavarman that Drupada's child, Sikhandin, was actually a girl, not a boy.  This was a big secret!

Drupada tried to explain that it wasn't true, but Hiranyavarman didn't believe him.  He gathered a huge army and was marching to attack Drupada!

Drupada was scared. He whispered to his wife, Sikhandinâ€™s mother, "My brother is coming to fight!  He thinks Sikhandin is a girl! What do we do? We might all be in danger!"

Drupada was worried because he had kept the truth about Sikhandin's gender a secret. He pretended to not know the truth, trying to prove his innocence to everyone.  He asked his wife, "Is Sikhandin a girl or a boy?  Tell me the truth, so I can figure out what to do!"

His wife was also afraid. She knew that telling the truth was important, and everyone was in danger, including her son. She was ready to tell the king the truth.  But the story doesn't say what she told him just yet... what will she say?
