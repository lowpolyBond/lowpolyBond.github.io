Once upon a time, there was a tiny worm.  He was reborn as a brave warrior, a Kshatriya!  He remembered his past life as a worm and wanted to become better. So he started doing good deeds. He helped everyone and worked very hard.

A wise man, Krishna, saw the warrior being so kind. Krishna told the warrior, "Being a good warrior means protecting everyone.  If you protect people and do what's right, you'll become a Brahmin, a holy person!"

The warrior, even though he lived in a palace, helped his people. He was fair and always did the right thing.  Because he was so good, he became a Brahmin! Krishna was very happy and came to see him.

Another wise man, Vyasa, told the warrior, "Don't be afraid to die.  Doing good things brings good things.  Doing bad things brings bad things. Only worry about being good."

The warrior said, "Thank you!  Because of you, I've become a better person.  I feel all my bad deeds are gone!"

The warrior, now a Brahmin, built many places for worship.  He became so good and holy that he went to live with the gods!

Vyasa said, "Even the brave warriors who died in the big battle did good things. Don't be sad for them. They all went to a good place because they were brave and did their best."
