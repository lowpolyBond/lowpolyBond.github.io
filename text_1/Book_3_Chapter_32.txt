Draupadi said, "I believe in God, Yudhishthira.  Why would I ever forget Him? I'm sad, but I need to talk. Listen carefully.  Everyone needs to try their best. Only plants and rocks don't need to do things.

Even a baby cow drinks milk right away!  People even feel pain from magic spells done with their statues. This shows that what happens to us now is connected to what we did before.  People are special because they can choose how to live, now and later.

Everything we do has an effect.  Even the sun and the moon follow this rule!  If we don't try, we can't live properly.  We *must* try!  You need to act, too, don't be lazy!  Work hard, like wearing strong armor!

Most people don't understand how important it is to work. We need to work to get what we need and want!  If we only spend and don't work, even a huge pile of treasure would run out. If no one ever worked, the world would end!  If work didn’t have results, there would be nothing.  Sometimes we work and don't see the results right away. 

Some people believe everything is fate; others say it's just luck. Both are wrong!  The best people believe that hard work is important. If you just wait for good things to happen, you'll fail, like a clay pot falling apart in water!  It's the same for those who believe in luck and do nothing.  If you get something without trying, it's luck. If you get it from praying, it's a gift from God. If you work for it, it's because of your hard work.  Everything, good or bad, comes from our past actions. God sees what we've done before and gives us what we deserve.

Our bodies are just tools God uses. We think we choose, but it's really God who helps us.  We have minds to plan, but God gives us the strength. We are the reason for what we do.  We can learn to do things, just like how we know sesame seeds make oil, milk makes yogurt, and fire cooks food.  We learn how to do these things, then we do them! That’s how we survive.  A skilled person does a good job; a bad worker does a poor job.  If we weren't responsible for our work, there wouldn't be teachers or students! If someone does a good job, they get praise; if they do a bad job, they get blamed.

Some think everything is luck or fate.  But the truth is, it’s mostly from what we did before. We get some things through luck, some through fate, but most is from hard work. There's no other way! Smart people know this. If God didn't give us good and bad things, nobody would ever be unhappy.  If our past actions didn’t matter, everyone would always succeed. People who don’t believe this are like dummies.

But you must still try your best! That's what Manu, a very wise man, taught us.  If you don't try, you'll fail.  Those who work hard usually succeed, those who don’t never do. Even if you fail, try to solve the problem.  If you work hard, you pay your dues to the Gods.  Lazy people fail, while those who work succeed. Confident people succeed; those who doubt fail.  We are suffering now, but if you work, we can get better. If we fail, it shows we can’t win.  Others succeed; maybe we will too.  We can't know the future.  Try your best, and you'll see what happens.

A farmer plants seeds, then waits for rain. If the rain doesn't come, it's not the farmer’s fault. He did his part. Don't give up if you don’t succeed at first.  There are many reasons why we succeed or fail, more than just our effort.  Without trying, we can never succeed!  Smart people plan carefully. They choose the right time, and the right way to do things.  They are careful and brave. Bravery is the most important part.  If your enemy is stronger, be smart. Try to be friends with them, or find ways to trick them. If you need to, wish them harm.  Try to find your enemy’s weaknesses! This shows responsibility for yourself and your friends. Never put yourself down; those who do rarely succeed. Success comes from working hard when the time is right.

My father had a wise teacher, who taught him this.  He taught my brothers, and they taught me.  When I was little, I would sit on my father’s lap, and the teacher would tell me these wise stories, to help me feel better."
