The Pandavas, the five brothers, were on a journey.  They met a magical Gandharva (a heavenly being).  Arjuna, the best archer, asked the Gandharva, "We need a wise priest. Do you know one?"

The Gandharva said, "Yes!  There's a holy man named Dhaumya living in a sacred place called Utkochaka. He's really wise and knows all about the Vedas (holy books)."

Arjuna was happy! He gave the Gandharva a special fire weapon as a thank you.  He also said, "Keep the amazing horses you gave us for now. We'll come back for them later."

The Pandavas and the Gandharva said goodbye.  They went to Utkochaka and found Dhaumya.  He was happy to be their priest.  He gave them gifts of fruits and roots.

The Pandavas, along with their mother Kunti, were so excited!  With Dhaumya as their priest, they felt like they already had their kingdom back and would win the princessâ€™s hand!  They felt safe and protected.  Dhaumya was a kind and wise teacher. He blessed them and helped them.  The Pandavas, feeling strong and blessed, decided to go to the princess's wedding ceremony.
