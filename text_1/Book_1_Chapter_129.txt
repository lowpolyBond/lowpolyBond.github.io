Once upon a time, the Pandava brothers and their cousins, the Kauravas, were playing in a beautiful garden.  After playing, everyone except Bhima went back to their city, Hastinapura.  Some rode horses, some rode elephants, and others rode in chariots.

On the way, the brothers wondered, "Where's Bhima?"  Duryodhana, a mean Kaurava, was secretly happy Bhima was missing.  He went to the city with his brothers, feeling very pleased.

Yudhishthira, the kindest Pandava, thought everyone was as good as he was. He went to his mother, Kunti, worried.  "Mother," he said, "Have you seen Bhima? We looked everywhere! We think he went ahead of us, but we're very worried. He was asleep, and now he's gone!"

Kunti cried.  "No, my son!  I haven't seen him! Go back and look for him!"  She then called Vidura, a wise man. "Bhima is missing!" she said.  "Duryodhana hates him and wants the throne. I'm scared he's hurt Bhima!"

Vidura said, "Don't worry so much!  Protect your other sons.  Everything will be alright. Bhima will be back."

Meanwhile, Bhima woke up eight days later. He had been sleeping in a magical place with snakes! The snakes told him, "You're super strong now!  Go home, your brothers miss you!"

Bhima took a bath, ate some yummy food the snakes gave him, and came back to the garden. He ran home to his mother and brothers.  Everyone hugged and was so happy!

Bhima told them about the snakes and how Duryodhana was mean. Yudhishthira said, "Let's keep this a secret."

Later, Duryodhana tried to poison Bhima's food! But Yuyutsu, a good cousin, warned the Pandavas. Bhima ate the poisoned food, but it didn't hurt him!  Duryodhana and his friends tried many other tricks, but the Pandavas, with Vidura's help, stayed safe.

Finally, their grandfather, King Dhritarashtra, saw the princes were getting into trouble. He got them a teacher, Gautama (also called Kripa), to teach them how to fight and be good.  And so, their training began.
