Lomasa, a wise old man, told Yudhishthira, "King, you've passed the Usiravija, Mainaka, Sweta, and Kala mountains!  Look! Seven sacred rivers flow here. This place is very special.  Magical fire burns here all the time!  No one ever sees it except the most special people.  Focus your mind, dear Prince, so you can see this amazing place."

"This is where the gods play," Lomasa continued.  "We're near Mount Mandara, a sparkling white mountain home to Yakshas – magical beings!  Manibhadra and Kuvera, the Yaksha king, live there.  Thousands of strong Gandharvas, Kimpurushas, and Yakshas guard it. They're super fast, like the wind! They're so powerful, they could even move the King of the Gods!  Even scary Rakshasas protect the mountain. This place is hard to reach!"

Lomasa warned, "Kuvera has fierce helpers too. We have to be careful! Mount Kailasa is huge – six yojanas high! It has a giant jujube tree. Many gods, Yakshas, Rakshasas, and other magical creatures live here, going to Kuvera's palace.  But don't worry! I'll protect you, Bhima is strong, and your own goodness will help, too."

Lomasa asked the river Ganga to keep Yudhishthira safe. He prayed to many gods and goddesses to protect the king. Then he told Yudhishthira, "Be careful!"

Yudhishthira said, "Lomasa is worried.  Krishna, be safe, and don't be careless!  This is a dangerous place." He told everyone to be very clean.

Yudhishthira then spoke to Bhima, his strong brother: "Bhima, protect Krishna carefully.  Krishna always looks to you for help!"

Finally, Yudhishthira hugged his younger brothers, Nakula and Sahadeva.  He said, "Don't be scared, but be careful!"
