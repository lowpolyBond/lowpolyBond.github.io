Once upon a time, there was a clever Rishi (a wise holy man).  A little dog lived near his home.  The Rishi was kind, and he used magic!

One day, the dog was hungry.  The Rishi magically changed him into a strong tiger! The tiger ate lots of meat and slept soundly.

Then, a HUGE angry elephant came stomping along! The tiger was scared.  The Rishi, seeing this, changed the tiger into a big elephant, just like the angry one!  The angry elephant was now scared of *this* elephant!  The Rishi’s elephant splashed happily in lotus ponds.

But then, a scary lion appeared! The elephant was terrified!  The Rishi changed the elephant into a lion – a big, strong one!  Now the wild lion was afraid of the Rishi's lion!

The Rishi's lion lived happily, and all the other animals were too scared to come near.  But then, a Sarabha came along – a scary monster with eight legs and eyes on its forehead! It wanted to fight the lion.

The Rishi, using his magic again, turned the lion into a Sarabha too – an even stronger one! The wild Sarabha ran away!

The Rishi’s Sarabha was happy.  It ate lots of animals. But it became mean and ungrateful. It wanted to hurt the Rishi who had been so kind!

The Rishi knew what the Sarabha was planning. He said, "You were a dog, then a tiger, an elephant, a lion, and now a Sarabha. I helped you! But since you are ungrateful, you will be a dog again!"

And *poof*! The Sarabha turned back into a little dog. The dog learned that being kind and grateful is much better than being mean.
