King Dhritarashtra was very sad.  He asked his advisor Sanjaya, "What happened to our warriors after Bhishma, our strongest fighter, died?  I feel like we lost the whole war when Bhishma couldn't stop Arjuna. And now I hear my father is dead too!  It's so terrible!  Even though I'm very strong, I'm heartbroken. Tell me how Bhishma died. I can't believe he's gone! He was so brave, even magical weapons couldn't hurt him before!"

Sanjaya said, "In the evening, the great Bhishma died.  The Kurus were very sad, but the Pandavas were happy.  He fell to the ground, lying on a bed of arrows, but his body didn't quite touch the earth.  Everyone cried.  When Bhishma fell, both armies felt scared.  The sky turned dark, and even the sun seemed dim. The earth seemed to scream. Everyone said, ‘He knew so much! He was the wisest man!’  They also said, ‘He was so brave, he even gave up a happy life for his father!’"

Sanjaya continued,  "Your sons, King, were very sad.  Their faces were full of sorrow.  The Pandavas, though, were celebrating their victory. They blew their horns loudly.  Bhima, the strong Pandava brother, was very happy and had killed many enemies.  The Kurus were shocked and fainted.  Karna and Duryodhana gasped for air.  When Bhishma fell, there was chaos.  Dussasana, your son, rushed to Drona, the Kurus' general, and told him the terrible news. Drona fainted from the shock.  When he woke up, he stopped the fighting.  The Pandavas also stopped.  Both armies took off their armor and went to Bhishma. They all bowed down to him. Bhishma, even though he was hurt, smiled and said, 'Welcome, brave warriors!  I'm happy to see you.'"

Bhishma said, “My head is hurting. Can someone get me a pillow?” The kings brought many soft pillows. But Bhishma didn't want them.  He laughed and said, "These are not for a hero’s bed!"  Then he saw Arjuna, a great Pandava warrior, and said, "Arjuna, my head is hurting. Please, give me a pillow fit for a great warrior!"
