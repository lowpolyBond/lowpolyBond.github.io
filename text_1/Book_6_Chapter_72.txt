Once upon a time, in a great war, many brave warriors fought!  Sanjaya, a storyteller, described the amazing battle.

Sikhandin and King Virata bravely fought against the strong warrior Bhishma. Arjuna fought Drona, Kripa, and many other powerful kings.  Another brave king, from Sindhu, fought with his friends.  Bhima fought Duryodhana and Dussaha.  Sahadeva fought Sakuni and Uluka.  Yudhishthira fought the Kaurava elephants. Nakula fought the Trigartas. Satyaki and Chekitana, and Abhimanyu (Subhadra's son), fought Salya and the Kaikeyas.  Dhrishtaketu and Ghatotkacha fought the Kaurava chariots. Dhrishtadyumna, the Pandava army leader, fought Drona.

All the brave warriors fought fiercely!  The sun shone brightly as they battled.  Beautiful chariots with golden flags and tiger skins raced across the battlefield.  The warriors shouted loudly, like roaring lions!  So many arrows flew, it was hard to see the sun or the sky.  The battlefield shone with the light of swords, spears, and armor.  Many kings fell.

Bhishma, a very strong warrior, fought Bhima. He shot many arrows at Bhima, hurting him. Bhima threw a powerful spear, but Bhishma cut it in half!  Bhishma then broke Bhima's bow.  Then Satyaki quickly attacked Bhishma with many arrows.  Bhishma shot back, and killed Satyaki's charioteer! Satyaki's horses ran away, and everyone shouted in fear.

Bhishma fought like a powerful god, but the Panchalas and Somakas bravely fought back. Dhrishtadyumna and other Pandava warriors also fought Bhishma.  The Kaurava army, led by Bhishma and Drona, fought back hard.  The battle raged on!
