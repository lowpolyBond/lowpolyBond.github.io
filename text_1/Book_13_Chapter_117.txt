Once upon a time, a wise king named Yudhishthira asked his grandfather, Bhishma, a very important question.  "Grandpa," he said, "many people die in battle.  Why do they do that? Is it good or bad to die fighting?"

Bhishma smiled. "It's a great question, Yudhishthira!" he said.  "Let me tell you a story.  A long time ago, a very wise man, a Rishi, saw a tiny worm hurrying along the road."

The Rishi asked the worm, "Little worm, why are you in such a rush?"

The worm was scared. "I heard a big, loud cart coming!" he squeaked. "It will crush me!  I don't want to die! Life is so good, even for a worm like me!"

The Rishi said, "But little worm, you don't really *enjoy* things like we do.  Wouldn't dying be better than just crawling around?"

The worm said, "No! I like being alive!  I was once a human!  I was a rich man but I was very, very mean.  I was greedy and unkind. I didn't help others. I was jealous of everyone. I only thought about myself!"

The worm felt sad. "Because I was so bad, I'm now a worm," he continued.  "But I did one good thing. I once showed kindness to a holy man. Maybe that good deed will help me get back to being human someday, and live a better life."


Bhishma finished the story. "The worm, like everyone," he said to Yudhishthira, "is attached to life, even if it's not a perfect life.  Whether it is good or bad to die in battle, well, that depends on how you lived your life."
