King Dasaratha told his son Rama, "Tomorrow, you'll be king!"  He then called the wise teacher, Vasishtha.  He asked Vasishtha to tell Rama and his wife Sita to fast.  A fast is like a special day of prayer.

Vasishtha, riding in his chariot, went to see Rama. Rama was happy to see him. Vasishtha explained that the fast was for Rama's big day, becoming the next ruler. It was like when Nahusha gave his kingdom to Yayati a long time ago.

Rama and Sita agreed to fast.  Vasishtha went home.  Rama's palace was full of happy people!  It was like a beautiful lake full of flowers and birds.

Outside, the streets were so full of people! Everyone was excited for Rama's coronation. It was noisy and crowded, like a roaring ocean!  The city was all decorated with flowers and flags.  Everyone couldn't wait for the next day.

Vasishtha went to King Dasaratha’s palace.  He told the king that everything was ready. The king was very happy.  He went to his private rooms.

The king was happy and excited, like the moon shining brightly in the night sky.  He was ready for tomorrow’s big celebration!
