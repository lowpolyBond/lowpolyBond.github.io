Once upon a time, a wise man named Parasara told a story. He said, "People don't always do nice things. They often think only of themselves.  Sometimes, they even forget their own parents and brothers!"

He explained, "Giving gifts is good, and receiving gifts is good too. But giving is even better!"

Parasara said, "If you work hard and earn money fairly, keep it safe.  Don't hurt anyone to get rich. Do what you can, but don't be greedy."  He said even giving a cup of water to a thirsty person is a kind act, just like giving food to a hungry person.

He told of amazing people, like Rantideva, who was very kind and helped everyone.  Sivi's son was also kind and generous. Parasara said we all owe something to many people: the gods, our guests, the people who work for us, our ancestors, and ourselves.

"How do we repay these debts?" he asked. "We repay the gods by praying and doing good things. We repay our ancestors by remembering them. We repay our friends and family by being kind. We repay ourselves by learning and taking care of our bodies."

Parasara talked about many great holy men.  They were kind and worshipped the gods. They did amazing things through prayer and hard work.  He said true wealth is earned honestly, not by cheating or hurting others.

"Being good is always important," he said. "Never forget to be kind, even if you're poor.  Always respect your family and teachers.  Treat everyone with kindness, even if you don't have much."

Parasara explained that the best people are humble and kind to everyone. They don't boast, and they always try their best to help others.  He said these are the truly rich and happy people.
