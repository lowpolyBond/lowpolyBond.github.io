Once upon a time, in the kingdom of Ayodhya, lived a brave prince named Rama.  His mother, Queen Kaushalya, loved him very much.  Rama had to go away for a long time.  Queen Kaushalya felt sad, but she tried to be brave.

She prayed to the gods to keep Rama safe.  She asked the gods of the sky, the earth, the rivers, and the mountains to watch over him. She asked the sun, the moon, and the stars to shine on him. She even asked animals like lions and elephants to be kind to him.

She asked for the great wise people and powerful warriors to protect him.  She prayed that Rama would always find food and water, and that his journey would be easy.  She wished for him to be safe from bad people and scary animals. She wished that he'd always be happy and healthy.

Queen Kaushalya performed a special ceremony with fire and flowers and special prayers. She asked the wise priests to bless Rama.  She gave them gifts.

She gave Rama a special healing wood for protection.  She hugged Rama tightly, kissed his forehead, and told him to be safe.  She said she'd be very happy when he came home.  She wanted him to come back a king, and she wanted him to marry the princess Sita.

With tears in her eyes, Queen Kaushalya hugged Rama again and again. Rama touched his mother's feet to show his respect. Then, the brave Prince Rama went to see Princess Sita, ready for his big adventure.
