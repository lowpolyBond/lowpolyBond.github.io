King Yudhishthira asked Bhishma, "You always honor wise priests. Why do you do this? What good comes from it?"

Bhishma was very old and tired. He said, "My friend Krishna knows all the answers. He can tell you.  I'm getting ready to die, and I don't have much strength left."

Then Bhishma told Yudhishthira about Krishna.  "Krishna is amazing! He is super-smart and powerful. He created the Earth, the sky, and everything you see! He even saved the Earth from being swallowed by the ocean. He is the sun, the wind, and even the rain! He's been around forever!"

Bhishma explained that Krishna is everywhere. He's in the good things and the bad things. He's the cause of everything. He's even helped people in different ways throughout history.

Bhishma said, "Krishna is like a super-powerful superhero! He helps good people and fights bad people. He is the protector of the world. Everything comes from him, even the seasons, the animals, and the plants.  He is in everything and is also Vishnu, the most important god!"

Bhishma told Yudhishthira to ask Krishna himself for more answers. He said Krishna is the ultimate source of everything, good and bad. He is the beginning and end of all things. Nothing is greater than Krishna.  He is the reason everything exists!
