Once upon a time, in the land of Bharat, a good king named Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, about special ceremonies called Sraddhas.  These ceremonies honored the gods and the ancestors.

Yudhishthira asked, "Grandpa, how should we do these ceremonies correctly?"

Bhishma smiled and said, "First, you must be very clean.  Then, you should honor the gods in the morning and your ancestors in the afternoon. Give gifts to people at midday, with kindness.  But be careful!  Gifts given at the wrong time go to the Rakshasas, who are mischievous creatures!"

Bhishma explained what made a gift go to the Rakshasas:

* If someone stepped on the food.
* If an animal licked it.
* If it wasn't given happily.
* If an unclean woman saw it.
* If it was announced to lots of people.
* If a low-caste person ate some.
* If a dog saw or licked it.
* If it had hair, worms, or spit on it.
* If a dog looked at it, or if tears or feet touched it.
* If someone who couldn't say "Om" ate it.
* If a soldier or a bad person ate it.
* If someone else ate from it first.
* If it wasn't offered to the gods, guests, and children first.

"Only the best Brahmins (wise priests) should receive gifts," Bhishma said. "But some Brahmins shouldn't be given gifts.  For example:

* Brahmins who did bad things.
* Those who were sick (like with leprosy or blindness).
* Those who were doctors, temple workers, or who sold holy things.
* Those who were singers, dancers, or soldiers.
* Those who served low-caste people.
* Those who were paid to teach.
* Those who married a low-caste woman.
* Those who didn't have a home fire, were thieves, or did other bad things.
* Brahmins who were not known to be good.

But Bhishma also said some good Brahmins *could* receive gifts, even if they did other jobs:

* Those who followed religious rules.
* Those who knew special prayers.
* Those who were kind and did their duties.
* Even some farmers, if they were good people.
* Those who prayed every day and were kind to guests.
* Those who were poor but honest.

Bhishma added, "Wealth from bad actions, like cheating or selling holy things, should never be given away."

He also explained when to have Sraddhas:  "The best time is when you have a good Brahmin, curd and ghee (butter), and the right day, and meat from animals like deer."  He explained the words to say after the Sraddha, depending on who performed it.

Then, Bhishma talked about what leads to heaven or hell:

**Going to HELL:**

* Lying (except to protect someone or your teacher).
* Cheating on your spouse.
* Stealing or destroying things.
* Gossiping.
* Destroying water sources or public places.

* Making weapons.
* Blocking paths.
* Abandoning your teachers or loyal workers.
* Overworking animals.
* Being a bad king.
* Abandoning your friends.
* Eating without sharing with your children and elders.

**Going to HEAVEN:**

Bhishma finished by saying, "That's how we honor the gods and our ancestors, and that's how to live a good life."  Yudhishthira thanked his grandfather for his wise words.
