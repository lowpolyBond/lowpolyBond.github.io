Once upon a time, after talking with a wise man named Vidura, Krishna, a very strong and kind warrior, visited his aunt, Kunti.  Kunti was very sad.  She hugged Krishna tightly and cried.  She missed her five sons, the Pandavas, very much.

Kunti told Krishna how worried she was.  Her sons, who used to sleep in beautiful palaces with soft beds and the sounds of music waking them, were now living in a scary forest!  The forest was full of lions, tigers, and elephants.  They used to wake to the sounds of drums, flutes, and elephants, not the roars of wild animals.

She described each son:  Yudhishthira, the kind and fair-skinned oldest brother; Bhima, strong as ten thousand elephants; Arjuna, a super archer; the twins, Nakula and Sahadeva, who were brave and kind.  She was especially worried about her sons' safety and how they were managing in the wilderness.

Kunti also talked about Draupadi, her daughter-in-law, who was married to all five brothers.  Draupadi was a princess, but she had suffered a lot of mean treatment.  She was even dragged into a big meeting and insulted! Kunti said this hurt her more than anything.  She only wanted her sons and Draupadi to be safe and happy.

Kunti told Krishna how she felt that even though she had done nothing wrong, all this bad luck had befallen her family. She missed her sons terribly. It felt as if they were dead to her, even though they were not.  She asked Krishna to tell her sons to fight for what is right and to never give up.

Krishna comforted his aunt. He told her that her sons were brave and good. He reassured her that they were doing well and would soon return home victorious.  He promised that they would win back their kingdom and defeat their enemies.

After comforting Kunti, Krishna left to visit the enemy, Duryodhana.  Kunti knew that Krishna would do what was right and help her sons.  She believed in Krishna and trusted him completely.
