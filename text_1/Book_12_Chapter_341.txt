Once upon a time, wise Saunaka asked a question: "Narayana, the great god, knows everything about the holy books. He doesn't need anything, yet he also enjoys offerings from sacrifices. Why does he let other gods get offerings, too?"

Suta, another wise person, said, "I'll tell you what Vaisampayana, a student of Vyasa, told King Janamejaya."

King Janamejaya had a big question.  "Everyone wants to be happy and successful. But you said that true happiness is leaving all worldly things behind.  Gods like Indra, the sun god, and even the wind god, enjoy offerings!  They don't seem to want to leave everything. Why is that?"  He felt confused.

Vaisampayana said, "This is a very big, secret question.  Only those who have been very good and studied the ancient stories can answer it. My teacher, Vyasa, once answered this for me and my friends."

Vaisampayana explained what Vyasa had said:  "A long time ago, all the gods and great wise people went to the greatest god, to ask him what to do.  They wanted to help the world.  The great god said, 'I will give you power.  You will enjoy the offerings people give you. This will give you strength to help the world.  But remember, I am the one who is truly powerful, I am the ultimate being.'

The gods were very happy. They performed a huge sacrifice for the great god, giving him a share of the offerings. The great god was pleased. He told the gods, "You will get your strength from these offerings. You will help the world.  But there are other wise people who want a different kind of happiness—they want to be one with me, to become free from the world's things. They follow a different path."

So, some gods enjoyed offerings, helping the world and getting strength from sacrifices. Others, the wise people, wanted to be free from everything and be close to the great god.  That’s why there are different paths to happiness. The great god is the start, the middle, and the end of everything. He created everything and is inside everything.

Vaisampayana said, "This is what Vyasa told us.  Anyone who hears this story will be happy, healthy, and strong!  They will get what they want and live a long life.  It is a very important story."
