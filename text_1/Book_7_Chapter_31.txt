Once upon a time, in a great battle, the Pandavas were winning!  Arjuna, the best warrior, was very strong.  He defeated many of the Kauravas.  The Kauravas, who were on the other side, were sad and tired.  Their armor was dirty, and they were covered in dust.  They went home to rest and felt very bad because Arjuna was so amazing.

The next morning, Duryodhana, the Kaurava king, was angry. He shouted at Drona, their best teacher and warrior,  "You had a chance to capture Yudhishthira, but you didn't!  Arjuna is too strong.  You must do something!"

Drona felt ashamed. He said, "Even the gods can't defeat Arjuna when he's with Krishna! But today, I will defeat one of his strongest warriors." He cleverly tricked Arjuna away from the battlefield.

Drona made a super strong circle of soldiers, like a wall no one could break. Abhimanyu, a young warrior,  decided to attack!  He was so brave.  He bravely broke into Drona's circle, fighting many soldiers. He was amazing and defeated lots of them!

But then, many, many warriors attacked Abhimanyu at once. They were too many for even the brave Abhimanyu.  Sadly, he fought bravely but was killed.

The Kauravas were happy, but the Pandavas were very, very sad. They were heartbroken that Abhimanyu, who was still young, had been killed.

King Dhritarashtra, the blind king of the Kauravas, heard about it and was upset.  He asked Sanjaya, his advisor, to tell him exactly how Abhimanyu, so young and strong, had been killed.

Sanjaya explained how Abhimanyu fought bravely, but many Kaurava warriors were too strong for him to fight against all at once.  It was like a forest fire, burning down all the trees, one by one, until there were none left.  Abhimanyu was so brave, but he was sadly killed in the end.
