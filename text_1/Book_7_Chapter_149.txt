Suyodhana, the prince, was very sad.  Lots of his soldiers had died in battle. He saw his army getting smaller and smaller.  Arjuna, a Pandava warrior, was so strong, he defeated many brave fighters. Suyodhana cried. He thought no one could beat Arjuna.  Even his best warriors, like Karna and Jayadratha, had lost!  His face was wet with tears. He felt like a snake whose teeth had been broken – weak and helpless.

He went to his teacher, Drona.  "Teacher," he sobbed, "so many of my friends and soldiers are dead! Bhishma, our grandfather, is gone.  Arjuna is unstoppable! He killed Jayadratha and so many others! Even Jalasandha and Alamvusha are dead!  My army is almost gone!  Everyone is afraid of Arjuna.  It's all my fault!"

Suyodhana was very upset. He felt terrible about all the deaths. He blamed himself for starting the war.  He felt guilty for the loss of his friends.  He didn't think he deserved to live anymore.

He told Drona, "I owe it to my dead friends to fight until the end.  I'll either defeat the Pandavas or I'll die trying! I’ll go where they’ve gone."  He felt he had to either win or join his fallen friends. He was sad and angry, and he didn't know what to do.  He knew his army was almost completely defeated because of his actions.
