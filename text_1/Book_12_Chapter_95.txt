Once upon a time, in the land of Bharat, a wise king named Yudhishthira asked his grandfather, Bhishma, a very brave and experienced warrior, about how a king should win a battle.

Yudhishthira asked, "Grandfather, if a king wants to win a battle against another king, how should he do it?"

Bhishma answered, "First, the king should go to the other king's land. He should tell the people, 'I am your new king, and I will protect you.  Give me what you owe me, or we will fight!' If the people agree to be his subjects, there's no need for a battle.  If people who aren't warriors fight back, the king must stop them, but he must be fair and kind."

Yudhishthira then asked, "But Grandfather, what if two kings *do* fight?"

Bhishma explained, "A warrior should never attack another warrior who isn't wearing armor, unless he's also without armor.  If one king has an army, the other king should also have an army.  If one king cheats, the other may cheat back. But it's always best to fight fairly.  Don't attack someone from a horse if you're in a chariot, and vice-versa.  Never hurt someone who is already hurt, scared, or has already lost.  Never use poisoned arrows or sharp weapons meant to hurt extra badly â€“ those are for bad guys!  Fight bravely, but don't get angry or want to kill."

Bhishma continued, "Never kill someone who is weak, injured, without children, whose weapons are broken,  or whose chariot is destroyed. If you defeat an enemy, take care of their wounds.  If two good kings fight and one gets hurt, help him heal, then let him go.  This is the right way to fight, like the wise King Manu taught us.  Winning by being unfair is wrong; it's like hurting yourself.  It's better to die fighting fairly than to win by cheating."

Bhishma warned, "Bad things you do might not hurt you right away, but later, they will cause big problems.  A bad king might win many battles by cheating, but eventually, his bad actions will catch up to him. He will lose everything.  It's always better to be good and fair, even if it means losing a battle."
