Long ago, King Nriga was a good king. He gave away lots and lots of cows to holy men called Brahmins.  But one day, something bad happened.

A Brahmin's cow wandered away.  It ended up in King Nriga's herd.  The king's people didn't know it belonged to someone else.  Later, the king gave the cow to another Brahmin.

The real owner found his cow! He was very angry. He and the Brahmin who got the cow argued with the king.  The king tried to give the first Brahmin many, many other cows to get his cow back, but the Brahmin wouldn't give it up. He loved his new cow!

King Nriga couldn't get the cow back. He was sad because he'd broken a promise to always protect everyone. He knew he had done something wrong, even if it was a mistake.

After he died, King Nriga became a giant lizard stuck in a well!  He was stuck there for a very long time.  Some young men found him. They tried to help him, but they couldn't.  So they went to Krishna, a very powerful and kind god.

Krishna rescued King Nriga!  He asked the lizard why he was there. King Nriga explained about the cow.  Krishna told King Nriga he'd been punished for taking the Brahmin's cow, even though it was an accident.  After a thousand years, Krishna let him go to heaven.

Krishna told everyone this story to teach them a lesson: Never take anything that belongs to a Brahmin, or anyone else!  It's always better to be kind and honest. Even a small mistake can have big consequences. And being good always helps, even if you make mistakes.  Meeting good people can help you, just like Krishna helped King Nriga!
