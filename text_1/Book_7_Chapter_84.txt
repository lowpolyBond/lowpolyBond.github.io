Arjuna, the brave warrior, went to see his brother, King Yudhishthira.  He wanted to see the king and his friends before the big battle.  Yudhishthira was so happy to see Arjuna! He hugged him tight and said, "Arjuna, you look ready to win!  You're shining, and even Krishna, your friend, seems happy for you!"

Arjuna smiled. "I saw something amazing!" he said.  "Krishna helped me see a powerful god! It showed me we will win!"  Everyone was amazed. They bowed their heads and whispered, "Wonderful!"

Then, Yudhishthira, Arjuna, and Krishna, another great warrior, got ready for battle. They all felt very brave.  Krishna, who was also Arjuna's charioteer, got Arjuna's chariot ready.  It was shiny and gold, like the sun!  Arjuna put on his golden armor, and wise, old priests blessed him. He climbed into the chariot, ready to fight.

Krishna drove the chariot, just like a driver. Satyaki, another brave warrior, also joined them.  It was like the sun, the moon, and the stars all riding together!  Musicians played happy music, and everyone wished them luck.  A wonderful breeze blew, helping Arjuna.  It was a sign that they would win!

Arjuna knew he had to fight the enemy king. But he also needed someone to protect his brother, Yudhishthira.  He turned to Satyaki, his friend, and said, "Satyaki, please protect Yudhishthira. You're as strong as Krishna, even stronger than many gods!  With you watching over him, I can go fight without worry."  Satyaki agreed.  "I will," he said, and went to protect the king.
