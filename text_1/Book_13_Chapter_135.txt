Once upon a time, in the land of Bharat, a king named Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, a very important question.  "Grandpa," he said, "who can different people accept food from?"

Bhishma, who knew everything, smiled. He explained, "It depends on who you are!  A Brahmin, who is a very holy person, can accept food from another Brahmin, a Kshatriya (a warrior), or a Vaisya (a farmer or trader). But never from a Sudra (a worker)."

"A Kshatriya can accept food from a Brahmin, another Kshatriya, or a Vaisya.  But not from a bad Sudra who eats anything and everything!" Bhishma said.  "Only good Vaisyas who pray every day and are very kind are okay."

Bhishma said accepting food from a Sudra is like eating dirt!  It's very bad.  He explained that each person has a job to do. Brahmins study holy books and help people. Kshatriyas protect people. And Vaisyas grow food and make things.  If anyone does a Sudra's job, they become like a Sudra themselves.

Bhishma warned that accepting food from some people is even worse than eating dirt!  He said taking food from a doctor is like eating poop! Taking food from a bad person is as bad as killing a Brahmin!  It's also bad to accept food if someone doesn't treat you nicely.

Bhishma said accepting food from certain people brings bad luck: a person who kills a cow or Brahmin, a cheater, a drunkard, or someone unkind.  He even said accepting food from a city guard is very bad!

"So," Bhishma finished, "that's who you can and can't take food from!  Is there anything else you want to know, Yudhishthira?"

Yudhishthira listened carefully, learning many important lessons about how to treat everyone and make good choices.
