Once upon a time, in the land of gods and mortals, a wise priest named Vrihaspati was upset.  He was the priest of the gods, but another priest, Samvarta, was going to lead a big ceremony for King Marutta.  Vrihaspati didn't like this!

He went to Indra, the king of the gods, looking sad. "Indra," he said, "Samvarta is going to be the priest at King Marutta's important ceremony.  This makes me unhappy."

Indra was surprised.  "But Vrihaspati," he said, "you're the best priest!  What can Samvarta do to you?"

Vrihaspati explained, "It's justâ€¦ it's like having a friend get a better toy than you.  It bothers me that someone else will get the honor."

Indra decided to help.  He sent Agni, the god of fire, to King Marutta.  Agni zoomed there, like a whirlwind, leaving trails of smoke behind.  He told the king that Vrihaspati should lead the ceremony. It would even make the king immortal!

But King Marutta said, "No, Samvarta is my priest.  I don't want to change."

Agni tried again, but Samvarta, angry and powerful, threatened Agni! Agni, scared, rushed back to Indra.

Agni told Indra what happened. Indra was angry!  "I'll show them," he said.  But Agni worried, "Samvarta is very strong.  He might even hurt me!"

Agni reminded Indra about a time when a powerful priest, Chyavana, had held Indra's magic thunderbolt!  Agni was afraid of making Samvarta angry.  "The power of priests is great," said Agni.  "I'm afraid of Samvarta."

Indra understood. Even the mighty king of the gods had been scared before. He realized that sometimes, even gods have to be careful. The story showed everyone that even the most powerful gods respect the power of wise priests.
