King Pandu was very sad.  A deer had died, and he felt terrible about it.  He said, "Even good people can do bad things. My own father died young because he loved too much. I'm a bad king, too! I've been hunting instead of doing what's right. I need to change."

Pandu decided to become a hermit.  He wanted to be a better person. He told his wives, Kunti and Madri, that he was leaving. He said he would give up everything â€“ his nice clothes, his jewelry, even his family.  He would live simply in the forest, begging for food. He promised to be kind to everyone, even insects and plants.  He wouldn't get angry or sad, and he wouldn't care about being praised or criticized.

Kunti and Madri were upset. They loved Pandu very much. They said, "Please don't leave us! We'll do hard things with you.  We'll give up all our nice things and live simply, too!"

Pandu said, "If you really want to, we can do this together." So, he gave away all his riches to poor people.  He told his servants to go back to the palace and tell everyone that he and his wives were becoming hermits. The servants cried, but they went home.

Dhritarashtra, Pandu's brother, was very sad to hear the news.  He missed Pandu very much.

Pandu, Kunti, and Madri went to live in the mountains. They ate fruits and roots.  They traveled to many beautiful places,  always trying to live a simple and good life.  They were protected by magical beings and wise people.  They lived a long time, practicing their new way of life.
