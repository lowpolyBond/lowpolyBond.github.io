Once upon a time, there was a brave prince named Pradyumna. He was the son of Rukmini.  He rode a shiny golden chariot pulled by strong horses.  A scary sea monster was on his chariot's flag, making everyone afraid!

Pradyumna fought against a mean king named Salwa.  He shot arrows so fast, it looked like lightning!  He was so strong, he didn't even flinch.  He roared like a lion, scaring Salwa's army.  Even the scary sea monster flag made Salwa's soldiers tremble.

Pradyumna wanted to fight Salwa himself. Salwa was angry! He jumped out of his chariot to fight.  Their fight was super amazing, like two powerful gods battling!

Salwa shot many fiery arrows at Pradyumna. Pradyumna was very skillful, and dodged them all.  He shot back with his own powerful arrows. He shot one arrow right into Salwa's heart! Salwa fell down, unconscious.  His army screamed and ran away!

But Salwa woke up! He shot more arrows, hitting Pradyumna.  Pradyumna got hurt and was very weak. Salwa roared like a lion. He shot even more arrows, and Pradyumna fell unconscious on the battlefield.
