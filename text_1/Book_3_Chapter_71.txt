King Rituparna wanted to go to Damayanti's wedding.  He asked Vahuka, his very good horse trainer, to take him.  Vahuka was really sad.  His friend Nala, Damayanti's husband, wasn't there.  He wondered if Damayanti was marrying someone else because she was still upset about Nala.  He wasn't sure what to think. "I need to find out!" he decided.  He agreed to take the king.

Vahuka went to choose the horses. He picked some that looked thin but were actually very strong. King Rituparna was surprised!  "These horses look weak!" he exclaimed.  "They can't take us such a long way!"

Vahuka explained, "These horses are special. They'll get us there!"  He hitched them to the chariot.

When they were ready to go, the horses knelt down!  Vahuka calmed them down.  Then, *whoosh!*  The horses started running super fast!  They were so fast it amazed the king and his old charioteer, Varshneya.

Varshneya watched Vahuka carefully. He was amazed by how well Vahuka controlled the horses.  He thought, "Is this Vahuka really just a horse trainer?  He's so good, it's like he's Matali, the god's charioteer!  Or maybe it's Nala himself, disguised!"

Varshneya knew Nala was a great horse trainer. He started to think maybe this Vahuka *was* Nala, just looking different because of sadness or something. The king was also very happy with Vahuka's skills.  They were on their way!
