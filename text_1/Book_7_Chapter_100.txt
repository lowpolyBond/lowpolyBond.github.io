Once upon a time, in the great Kurukshetra war, Arjuna and Krishna fought bravely.  They charged right through the enemy army!  Many soldiers were scared and ran away.  But then, feeling angry and ashamed, some soldiers tried to fight back.  They didn't stand a chance and were defeated, just like rivers disappear into the ocean.  Many cowardly soldiers ran away too, feeling very bad.

Arjuna and Krishna finally broke through the thickest part of the army, led by Drona. It was like the sun and moon escaping a monster!  They were tired, but they fought on, like two strong fish swimming through a big net.  They were amazing!  The enemy soldiers had thought Arjuna and Krishna would never escape, but they were wrong!

The soldiers saw Arjuna and Krishna break through and were really scared. They knew Jayadratha, their friend, would not survive this. Arjuna said, "Jayadratha is surrounded by the enemy. I will find him, and even if the gods protect him, we will defeat him!"

Arjuna and Krishna were like two thirsty elephants who found water in the desert, happy and strong again. They looked powerful and unstoppable.  The enemy soldiers cried out in fear.  Arjuna and Krishna were like two blazing suns. They were so strong that the enemy army, led by Drona, was defeated!

Duryodhana, the enemy prince, saw his friend, Jayadratha, in danger.  He rushed to save him on his chariot, but Arjuna and Krishna were too quick!  Duryodhana and his army turned to face them, making joyful sounds. The enemy protectors of Jayadratha were also happy to see Duryodhana. Krishna turned to Arjuna, ready to continue the fight against Jayadratha!
