Once upon a time, after the Pandavas were tricked out of their kingdom, their uncle Shakuni whispered to Duryodhana.  "You've won, Duryodhana! You rule the land!  All the kings are your servants now!"

Shakuni pointed out how the Pandavas' good luck had gone away.  "Their riches are now yours!  You've beaten them with your cleverness!"  He described how powerful Duryodhana was, like the sun in the sky, surrounded by his friends.

"Let's go see the Pandavas," Shakuni suggested.  "They're living in a forest by a lake, with nothing.  Let's show them how rich and happy we are. It will make us even happier to see them sad and poor, like the sun shining down on someone struggling in the dirt. Seeing your enemies unhappy is better than winning a war!"

Shakuni added a cruel idea: "Let your beautiful wife show off her fine clothes to Draupadi, who will now be wearing simple clothes made of tree bark. Let Draupadi, who was once so proud, feel even worse!"

After Shakuni and his friend Karna finished their mean plan, they said nothing more.
