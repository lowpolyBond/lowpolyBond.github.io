King, have you heard about Sankhya, the study of the mind and body? Now, listen to Yoga!  It's even more powerful!  Sankhya and Yoga are really the same, just different ways of looking at things.  Some people think they're different, but they're not!  Both help you reach peace and understanding.

Yoga uses your breath and senses. By controlling them, Yogis can go anywhere they want!  When their bodies die, their spirits travel, light and free.  They have amazing powers, like being super small or super fast!

There are two types of Yoga.  One is like focusing really hard on something, like a picture, while controlling your breath. The other is letting go of everything and focusing on just being.  It's like the difference between holding a balloon and letting it float away.

It's important to learn to control your breath. If you don't do it carefully, you might hurt yourself.  There are special ways to breathe, like twelve ways at night and twelve more later.

Imagine training your senses. You calm down and focus on your mind. Then, you go deeper, focusing on your thoughts, then understanding, then your true self. This leads you to Brahma, a powerful and peaceful place beyond our world.

When a Yogi is in Samadhi, they are totally calm.  They're like a steady flame, unmoved by anything, not even loud noises!  Imagine carrying oil up a staircase without spilling a drop, even if people try to scare you. That's how steady a Yogi is!

In Samadhi, the Yogi sees Brahma, a bright light in the darkness.  After many years of practice, they reach freedom.  This is true Yoga!  It's a wonderful journey of peace and understanding.
