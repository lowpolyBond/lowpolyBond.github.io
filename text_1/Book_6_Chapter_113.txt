Once upon a time, during a great war, a brave warrior named Drona was fighting. He was a powerful archer, as strong as a wild elephant!  He shot arrows into the Pandava army.  But then, he noticed strange things happening.

Drona looked around.  The animals were making scary noises.  Birds were crying.  The sun looked dull.  Even the ground seemed to shake!  He felt worried.

He told his son, "Son, today, Arjuna, a great warrior, will fight with all his might!  Something feels wrong. My bow feels heavy.  My arrows are hard to use.  I'm scared."

Drona saw many bad omens.  The sky was strange. The moon looked upside down!  Even the statues in the temples were moving! Drona knew this meant trouble.  He heard the sounds of battle â€“ Arjuna's bow and the war horn.

Drona knew Arjuna was going to fight Bhishma, a very old and powerful warrior. Bhishma had promised not to hurt Sikhandin. But there was a secret!  Sikhandin had once been a woman.  Drona worried this would bring bad luck.  He felt very sad and scared thinking about the battle between Bhishma and Arjuna.

"This battle will be terrible," Drona said to his son.  "Arjuna is very strong and clever. He can shoot arrows really far!  He's almost impossible to beat!"

Drona told his son, "Don't worry about your life. Fight bravely! Arjuna is like a strong whale, causing chaos in the army.  Go fight Sikhandin and Bhima. Remember your duty as a warrior, but keep your heart open and love living."  Drona knew this battle would bring great sadness.


So, Drona continued fighting, but in his heart, he felt the terrible weight of what was to come.  He knew this day would be filled with sadness and loss.
