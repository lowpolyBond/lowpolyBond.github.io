Long ago, in a land far away, lived a wise man named Swetaketu.  He lived in a beautiful hermitage filled with coconut trees.  He was very famous for knowing all about sacred chants and prayers.  One day, he saw a goddess and asked her to help him speak well.

Swetaketu had a nephew named Ashtavakra.  Ashtavakra was very clever, even though he was born with a crooked body. He and Swetaketu were both very, very smart.

One day, they went to a big party at King Janaka's palace.  There, a very proud man named Vandin thought he was the smartest person ever.  He challenged anyone to a contest of knowledge.  Ashtavakra, even though he was just a boy, showed Vandin how much smarter he was!  He won the contest.

But how did Ashtavakra become crooked?  His father, Kahoda, was a student of a great teacher named Uddalaka.  Kahoda studied very hard.  As a reward, Uddalaka gave Kahoda his daughter to marry.  While his wife was pregnant, Ashtavakra (still inside his mother!) talked back to his dad, saying his studies weren't very good.  His father was angry and said, "Because you talk back even before you're born, you will be born crooked!"  And that's why Ashtavakra was born with a crooked body.

Ashtavakra's father had been tricked and defeated by Vandin earlier, and drowned.  Ashtavakra learned the truth from his mother when he was a boy. This made him very sad, but he was also very determined to prove his intelligence.

So, Ashtavakra and Swetaketu went to the King's party.  Ashtavakra showed everyone how smart he was, and he even beat Vandin in a clever argument! Thatâ€™s how Ashtavakra, despite his crooked body, became famous for his intelligence.
