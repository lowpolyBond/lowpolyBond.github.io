King Sumitra went hunting deep in a big forest.  He was tired and hungry.  He found some wise holy men living there.

The holy men saw the king, all tired and dusty. They were kind and offered him food.  The king thanked them and asked about their lives.

Then the holy men asked the king, "Why are you here, Your Majesty? You look tired. Where did you come from?"

King Sumitra told them, "I'm from the Haihaya family. I'm chasing a deer. I shot it with my arrow, but it ran away! I followed it and ended up here, far from my palace and my hunting party."

He sighed. "I feel sad because I didn't catch the deer.  My hopes were dashed!  Wise men, you know so much. Tell me, is hope bigger than the sky, or is the sky bigger than hope?"

King Sumitra continued, "I don’t want to ask anything improper, but please tell me, what is so powerful about hope?"  The holy men listened to the king’s question very carefully.
