Once upon a time, King Yudhishthira asked his wise uncle, Bhishma, "Uncle, what's the best gift a king can give? What makes Brahmins (wise people) really happy? And what good things happen to someone who gives such gifts?"

Bhishma smiled. "Yudhishthira," he said, "I asked the same question to a very wise man named Narada.  Here's what he told me."

Narada said, "The most important gift is food!  Everything depends on food.  The world needs food, and people need food to be strong and healthy. Even gods and wise people appreciate food more than anything else.  Giving food is the best way to help others. When you give food to a hungry person, even a beggar or a poor person, it’s like giving a gift to everyone.  It’s so important!

Giving food to a wise Brahmin who asks for it brings great rewards, both now and in the next life.  Never turn away anyone who is hungry and needs help. Even if you give food to a dog or someone you don't like, it's still a good thing to do.

Giving food to your ancestors, the gods, wise people, and guests brings good luck. If you’ve done something wrong, giving food can help to make things better.

Giving food to a Brahmin is especially good. Don’t worry about whether they are rich or poor, just give them food if they ask.  People who give food will have plenty of food, animals, children, and everything good in their lives.  They will be strong and beautiful.  They’ll be happy now and have a wonderful place in heaven later.

Giving food is like giving life itself! Everything is built on food. Heaven and earth, and everything in between, depend on food.  Wise people always share their food."

Bhishma said, "Yudhishthira, that's what Narada taught me.  You should give food too!  When you give food to deserving people, you’ll have a wonderful place in heaven.  Imagine beautiful houses, shining brighter than stars, filled with everything you could want – delicious food, happy animals, amazing things.  That’s what awaits those who give food!"
