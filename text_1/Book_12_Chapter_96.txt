Once upon a time, the wise Bhishma told a story about being a good king.  He said a king should never win battles by cheating!  Even if he won the whole world that way, it wouldn't be a happy victory. A victory that isn't fair is like a wobbly tower – it will fall down.  It hurts both the king and his people.

Bhishma explained how to treat enemies.  If a warrior’s armor is broken, or he begs for mercy, or puts down his weapons, you should only take him prisoner, not kill him! After winning a battle, the king shouldn't fight the defeated king again. He should bring him home, and for a whole year, politely ask him, "Are you my servant now?"  Even if the king says "no," he still gets to live safely for a whole year.

If the king takes a princess from the enemy, he should keep her for a year and ask if she wants to marry him or someone else.  If she says no, he must send her home. He should be fair with everything else he takes in battle too. He shouldn't take things from thieves who are going to be punished.  Cows taken from the enemy should be given to the priests, and bulls should be used to help farm or be sent back.

Bhishma said a king should only fight another king. A king should never hurt a priest. If a priest bravely walks between fighting armies to make peace, the fighting must stop immediately!  It’s wrong to hurt a priest. Any warrior who does this is a bad person.

A good king makes peace with his new people quickly, giving them nice things and kind words. If he is mean, they’ll run away and help his enemies!

Bhishma talked about different kings.  One king took everything from his enemies, even their food, but left their land alone. Another took even the food from their ceremonies!  That wasn’t right; he lost his good luck because of it.  A really good king even gave away whole kingdoms as gifts to the priests, but only after making sure the wise priests and holy people kept their belongings.

Bhishma said, "The best kings were always kind and fair.  A king who wants to be happy and successful should always be brave and kind, but never sneaky or proud."
