Once upon a time, Princess Damayanti was traveling with a big group of traders.  They were going to see her husband.  After many days, they found a beautiful lake in a big, dark forest.  The lake was full of pretty flowers and birds, and the traders decided to rest there.

That night, while everyone slept, a HUGE herd of wild elephants came crashing through! They were angry and didn't see the traders sleeping near the lake.  The elephants trampled everything!  People screamed and ran. Some people got hurt.  Camels and horses died.  It was a terrible mess!

Damayanti woke up, terrified.  She saw the chaos all around.  The traders were scared and confused. Some blamed Damayanti, thinking she brought bad luck.  They shouted that she was a wicked spirit!  Damayanti, frightened and ashamed, ran into the forest.

She felt very sad and alone. She wondered why such a terrible thing had happened. She thought maybe it was because of something bad she did a long time ago.  She missed her husband and children terribly.

The next day, the few traders who survived left the lake.  Damayanti was all alone, very sad and heartbroken.  She was lost and wearing only half a dress.  She walked until she reached a city.  The people stared at her, because she looked very sad and messy.

A kind queen saw Damayanti.  The queen thought she was beautiful, even though she looked upset.  The queen asked Damayanti who she was.

Damayanti told the queen her story. She explained how she had followed her husband into the forest after he lost everything playing a game.  She told how he left her alone, even though she had been very loyal to him.  She was still looking for him.

The kind queen said, "Stay with me! My people will help you find your husband." Damayanti agreed, but only if she could have some rules: she wouldn't eat leftovers, wash anyone's feet, or talk to strange men. If anyone tried to make her their wife, the queen would punish them!  The queen happily agreed to all her rules.

The queen’s daughter became Damayanti’s friend.  Damayanti felt safe and happy for the first time in a long time, knowing that people cared for her and were helping her find her husband.
