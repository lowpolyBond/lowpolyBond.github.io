The Pandavas, the five brothers, got out of their chariots.  They walked to their grandfather's house, bowing their heads politely.  Everyone else walked too – the soldiers, the people, even the wives of the Kuru princes.

The Pandavas reached the king's quiet home.  It was a beautiful place, full of deer and banana trees!  Many holy men, curious to see them, were there.

The king, Dhritarashtra, had tears in his eyes.  "Where's my father?" he asked.  The Pandavas told him their grandfather had gone to the Yamuna River to wash and get flowers.

The Pandavas hurried to the river. They saw their grandfather and grandmother from afar.  Sahadeva, the youngest, ran to his mother, Kunti, and hugged her, crying. Kunti hugged him and cried too. She told Gandhari, her sister-in-law, that Sahadeva had arrived.

Then Kunti saw the king and her other sons – Bhima, Arjuna, and Nakula. She rushed to them.  She even pulled her blind father-in-law, Dhritarashtra and her blind sister-in-law, Gandhari along!  When the Pandavas saw their mother, they fell to the ground.  Dhritarashtra knew it was them – he could tell by their voices and when he touched them.  He hugged them all.

The Pandavas gave their grandfather and grandmother the water pots they were carrying. They didn’t need to carry them anymore.  All the women and people of the kingdom came to see the old king. Yudhishthira, the oldest Pandava brother, introduced everyone to his grandfather, one by one.  He bowed to his grandfather too, showing respect.

Everyone was so happy to be together! Dhritarashtra felt like he was home again.  Even Krishna, Arjuna's wife, greeted him.  The whole place was joyful, filled with happy tears. Then, they all went back to the king’s home in the forest, a special place loved by gods and people, full of many, many visitors.
