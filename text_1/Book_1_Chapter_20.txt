Once upon a time, after the gods and demons churned the ocean, a beautiful white horse named Uchchaihsravas appeared!  Sauti, the storyteller, told everyone about it.

Two sisters, Kadru and Vinata, saw the horse.  Kadru asked Vinata, "Sister, what color is the horse's tail?"

Vinata said, "It's white!"

Kadru said, "I think it's black! Let's make a bet! Whoever is wrong becomes the other's servant!"

They made the bet.  Kadru was sneaky. She told her snake children, "Turn into black hairs and cover the horse's tail!  Then I'll win!"

But the snakes refused!  Kadru was so angry, she cursed them: "King Janamejaya will have a big fire sacrifice, and you'll all be burned up in it!"

Even the great god Brahma heard this terrible curse.  He knew the snakes were very poisonous and dangerous.  He thought Kadru was right to curse them.  It was their fate.  Brahma told their father, Kasyapa, not to worry.  The snakes' death was already planned.  He even taught Kasyapa how to deal with snake poison.

And that's the end of that part of the story!
