Once upon a time, King Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, about giving gifts.  He wanted to know who was the best person to give gifts to.

"Grandfather," Yudhishthira said, "Who should get the best gifts?  A priest who looks like a priest, or one who doesn't?"

Bhishma smiled. "My dear King," he said, "Any priest who does his job well is worthy of a gift, whether he looks like a priest or not. Both are good!"

Yudhishthira asked another question. "If someone isn't very good, but gives gifts with a kind heart, is that okay?"

Bhishma answered, "Yes!  A kind heart makes everything better.  Being good comes from the heart, not just from following rules."

Yudhishthira then asked about special ceremonies for the gods and ancestors.  "Should we check if a priest is good before we use him for ceremonies for the gods?  And what about ceremonies for our ancestors?"

Bhishma explained, "For god ceremonies, it doesn't matter so much. The gods make it work. But for ancestor ceremonies, it's better to choose a good priest."

Yudhishthira asked why some people were considered best to give gifts to.  He listed five types: strangers, learned priests, relatives, holy people, and people who do sacrifices.

Bhishma said, "Strangers, relatives, and holy people should be kind, honest, and good. Learned priests and those who do sacrifices need to be kind, honest, and good too.  Here's what the Earth, Kasyapa, Agni (the fire god), and Markandeya said about being good."

The Earth said, "Like mud in the ocean, sins disappear if you do good things, like helping at ceremonies, teaching, and giving gifts."

Kasyapa said, "Being born good isn't enough.  You need to be good all the time."

Agni said, "A priest who uses his smarts to hurt others is not good."

Markandeya said, "Being truthful is even more important than doing many ceremonies."

Then Bhishma told Yudhishthira about giving gifts to priests who had spent many years learning and studying.  Even if they asked for gifts, giving to them was still okay.  But giving to bad priests was very wrong.

Bhishma said being honest, kind, and self-controlled is what makes someone good.  He also said that giving gifts to bad people is very, very bad.

Yudhishthira asked what was better than a holy life. Bhishma said self-control and giving things up is even better.

Yudhishthira then wanted to know when to work, be good, and have fun.

Bhishma said, "Work hard when you are young, then do good things, then enjoy life. But don't get stuck on any of these things."  He also said that being dishonest is as bad as hurting a priest.

Finally, Yudhishthira asked about the best kind of priests to give gifts to.

Bhishma said, "Give gifts to kind, honest, and self-controlled priests.  The best priests are wise, kind to everyone, and always do what is right.  Giving to a good priest is like multiplying your good deeds a thousand times!"
