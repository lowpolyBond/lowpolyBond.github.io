After a big battle, brave King Yudhishthira went to his wise grandfather, Bhishma, who was lying hurt.  Yudhishthira asked, "Grandpa, how can someone who has been unkind in their thoughts, words, or actions become a good person again?"

Bhishma smiled.  "My dear grandson," he said, "being kind is very important.  There are four ways to be kind:  don't hurt anyone with your actions, words, or thoughts, and help others whenever you can.  It's like a table with four legs; if one leg is missing, the table falls.  If you're not kind in even one of these ways, you're not truly kind."

"Eating meat is not kind," Bhishma continued. "Think of it â€“  eating an animal is like eating your own child!  It's very wrong.  When we hurt others, we create bad karma, which makes us unhappy in our next lives.  Even if the meat is tasty, it makes our minds weak and keeps us from finding true happiness.  People who eat meat don't hear the beautiful music of heaven.  Instead of eating animals, long ago, good people gave their own flesh to save others. That's true kindness!"

Bhishma explained, "Kindness is the most important religion of all. It includes all other good things." Yudhishthira understood and felt much better.
