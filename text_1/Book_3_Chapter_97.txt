Once upon a time, there was a wise man named Agastya. He saw a beautiful princess named Lopamudra.  He thought she was wonderful and asked her father, the King, if he could marry her.

The King was so scared of the wise man! He didn't want to say no, but he also didn't want his daughter to marry him.  The King was very worried. He went to his Queen, but she didn't say anything.

Lopamudra heard her parents worrying.  She said, "Father, don't worry about me! I want to marry Agastya."  So, the King sadly agreed, and Lopamudra married the wise man.

Agastya told Lopamudra to take off her fancy clothes and jewelry.  She happily changed into simple clothes, just like him.  They went to live near a river and prayed to the gods.  Lopamudra loved and helped Agastya.

After a while, it was time for Lopamudra and Agastya to have a baby.  Lopamudra said, "My dear husband, I want to feel like a princess again, just for this special time. Could we have pretty clothes and flowers?"

Agastya said, "My dear, I don't have any fancy things like your father."

Lopamudra smiled. "You have magic powers! You can get anything you want!"

Agastya said, "That would use up my magic for good things. Let's find another way."

Lopamudra said, "My time is short.  But I don't want you to waste your magic either! Let's find a solution together!"

Agastya said, "My love, if that's how you feel, I will go find some nice things for us."  And so, he went to find something special to make his wife happy.
