Once upon a time, before a big battle, Yudhishthira's army grew stronger and stronger.  First, a brave warrior named Yuyudhana arrived with a HUGE army!  There were soldiers on foot, soldiers on horses, soldiers on elephants, and soldiers in chariots. They had swords, spears, arrows – all sorts of weapons!  Their army was so big, it looked like a stormy sky with lightning!  It was one *Akshauhini* – a super-duper big army!  Then, other kings came to help: Dhrishtaketu, Jayatsena, and Pandya, each bringing a whole *Akshauhini* too!  King Drupada arrived with his sons, and King Virata came with his army from the mountains. Wow!  The Pandavas now had SEVEN *Akshauhinis* ready to fight!

Meanwhile, Duryodhana also gathered a mighty army. King Bhagadatta brought him one *Akshauhini*. His soldiers were strong and shiny, like golden statues in a forest!  Bhurisravas and Salya each brought another *Akshauhini*.  Kritavarman brought even more soldiers.  Jayadratha's army was so big it made the mountains shake! Sudakshina came with more soldiers, and King Nila arrived from the south with his own army.  Even the two kings of Avanti and the five Kekaya princes each brought one *Akshauhini* each!  In total, Duryodhana had ELEVEN *Akshauhinis* – an incredibly massive army!

Duryodhana's army was so HUGE that there wasn't even enough room for all the leaders in Hastinapura!  They spread out across the land –  across the five rivers, through the forests, and along the banks of the Ganga River. It was a sea of soldiers! A priest from the Panchalas saw this massive army, and he knew a great battle was coming.
