Once upon a time, a wise king named Yudhishthira was confused.  His grandfather, Bhishma, had said that you shouldn't trust your enemies. But Yudhishthira wondered, "How can a king win a war if he trusts no one?"

Bhishma smiled.  "Let me tell you a story," he said.  "It happened long ago in King Brahmadatta's palace.  A clever bird named Pujani lived there.  Pujani could copy all the animal sounds! She was like a feathered friend to the king."

Pujani had a baby bird.  At the same time, the queen had a baby boy, a prince.  Every day, Pujani flew to the ocean and brought back two magical fruits. One was for her baby, and one for the prince.  The fruits made them strong and healthy.

One day, the prince played roughly with Pujani’s baby bird.  He accidentally hurt the little bird so badly that it died.  Pujani was heartbroken.  She cried, "Never trust a king! They're nice only when they need you!"  Angry and sad, Pujani hurt the prince – she poked his eyes, blinding him.

King Brahmadatta saw what Pujani had done.  He said, "You avenged your baby.  We're even now.  Please stay."

But Pujani refused. "I can't stay," she said.  "Once someone hurts you, you can never truly trust them again.  Even their sons and grandsons might cause trouble." She explained that even if you forgive someone, the hurt remains.  It’s like a fire hidden in wood – it can flare up at any time.  She flew away.

King Brahmadatta tried to convince her to stay, saying that living together often makes enemies become friends. But Pujani disagreed. She said that true friendship is impossible after such hurt.

Pujani told the king that some things – like anger after being hurt – can never truly go away. She said that sometimes, even if you seem friends, it's better to stay apart.

Then Pujani said goodbye and flew away to a new home.  Bhishma finished the story, "That, my king, is why it's important to be careful about who you trust."  Yudhishthira nodded, understanding the lesson.
