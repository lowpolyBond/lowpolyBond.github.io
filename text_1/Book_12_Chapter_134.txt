Bhishma, a wise old warrior, once said, "For brave warriors, it's important to be strong and rich.  These are their most important jobs. Don't waste time arguing about what's right and wrong; just do what needs to be done.

It's like seeing footprints – you don't know if they're from a wolf until you check.  Nobody really knows if good things happen to good people or bad things to bad people.  So, a warrior should be strong! Strong people are in charge.  Being rich helps you have a big army and smart friends.  Poor people have a hard time.  Being poor is like having just tiny bits of food left after a big party – not enough to really enjoy.

If a strong person does something bad, people are too scared to say anything.  Strength and goodness together are best, but if you have to choose, strength is more important.  Strength is like the sun – goodness needs strength to shine. It's like smoke needs wind to blow.  Good people need strong people to help them.  Powerful people can do almost anything! They're always right in other people's eyes.  A weak person who does bad things gets into big trouble. Everyone is afraid of them, like they're afraid of a scary wolf.

Being poor makes you sad and ashamed. It's almost as bad as being dead.  If you've done bad things and people are mad at you, it's really painful.  To be better, you need to study hard, be kind, help people, be humble, marry well, and be good to everyone. Pray and be nice!  If you do all these things, you can make up for your mistakes, become happy, and be respected by everyone."
