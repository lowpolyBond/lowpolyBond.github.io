Once upon a time, King Yudhishthira, a very wise and good king, asked a giant snake a big question: "How can someone be good enough to go to heaven?"

The snake, who was super smart, said, "Giving gifts to others, speaking kindly, telling the truth, and never hurting anyone are the best ways to go to heaven!"

Yudhishthira wanted to know which was more important: telling the truth or giving gifts?  Being kind or not hurting anyone?

The snake explained, "It depends! Sometimes telling the truth is better, sometimes giving gifts is better.  The same is true for kindness and not hurting others.  It all depends on the situation."

Yudhishthira asked another question, "How do people's actions decide where they go after they die - to heaven, to be a human again, or to be an animal?"

The snake explained, "If someone is kind, helpful, and doesn't hurt others, they go to heaven! But if they're mean, lazy, and selfish, they might be born again as a human or even an animal!  Even cows and horses can become something amazing, even like gods, if they are good!  It all depends on what they do in their lives."

Yudhishthira was curious about something else.  "How do we see, hear, smell, taste, and touch things?" he wondered.

The snake said, "Our spirit, or soul, lives inside our bodies.  Our senses, mind, and intelligence help the spirit understand the world. The mind helps us notice only one thing at a time. When we close our eyes and think really hard, our spirit can even see other things."

Yudhishthira then asked the snake about the difference between the mind and the intelligence. The snake answered, "The mind feels things like happiness or sadness; the intelligence helps us understand the things we see and hear. It is tricky!"

Yudhishthira was surprised, "You're so smart! How could you ever be wrong?"

The snake sighed. "Even smart people can make mistakes.  I was once a powerful king in heaven! I was so proud and bossy, I hurt many people.  A wise man cursed me to be a snake because of my bad behavior. But now, talking to you has helped me become better, and I can go back to heaven."

The snake explained that being kind, truthful, giving gifts, and not hurting anyone, was much more important than anything else.  "These things, not your family name, will help you go to heaven!"

Then, the snake changed back into his handsome king form and went back to heaven! Yudhishthira and his brother Bhima were happy that the snake was better.  Everyone learned that being kind and good is really important.
