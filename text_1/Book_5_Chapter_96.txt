Long ago, a very proud king named Dambhodbhava ruled the whole world.  Every morning, he'd ask everyone, "Is anyone as strong as me in battle?" He was so boastful!

Wise people told him to stop bragging.  But he kept asking. Finally, some really wise men got angry.  "There are two people stronger than you," they said. "They're called Nara and Narayana. They live in the Gandhamadana mountains."

King Dambhodbhava, with his HUGE army, marched to the mountains. He found Nara and Narayana, who were very thin and weak from living simply in the woods.  He bowed down to them and still asked, “Can we fight?”

Nara and Narayana said, "This is a peaceful place. There's no fighting here. Go fight someone else."

But the king wouldn't stop! Nara picked up some blades of grass.  "Fight me with all your weapons!" he said.

The king and his army shot thousands of arrows! But Nara used the grass blades, and *poof*!  The arrows disappeared! Then, Nara used the grass blades to tickle the soldiers, making them lose their eyes, ears and noses!

The king was scared! He begged Nara to forgive him. Nara said, "Be kind.  Don't be proud.  Be good to everyone. Learn from your mistakes."

The king went home, a changed man.  He learned to be humble.

The story’s message is:  Pride is bad.  Being kind and humble is much better! Nara and Narayana are actually Arjuna and Krishna, great warriors from the Mahabharata.  They're very strong.  It's better to be peaceful.  Make peace and avoid a big war.
