Once upon a time, a kind prince named Ruru loved his beautiful wife, Pramadvara, very much.  Sadly, Pramadvara died. Ruru was so heartbroken! He cried and cried in the forest. He begged the gods to bring her back.

He said, "If I've been good, please bring her back to life!"

A magical messenger from the gods appeared.  The messenger said, "Ruru, you canâ€™t bring Pramadvara back completely.  But the gods have a plan.  You must give half of your own life to her."

Ruru didn't hesitate. He said, "I'll do anything! I'll give half my life to have her back!"

The messenger went to the God of Justice, and asked if Pramadvara could live again. The God of Justice said yes.

And magically, Pramadvara woke up! She was alive again, but because Ruru shared his life, he would live only half as long.

Ruru and Pramadvara were so happy! They got married again in a big celebration.  They loved each other very, very much.

But Ruru was still angry at snakes, and vowed to kill every snake he saw.  One day, in the forest, he found a big, old snake. Ruru raised his stick to kill it.

The snake said, "Please don't kill me! I haven't done anything wrong."

And that's where our story stops for now.  We'll hear more of Ruru and the snake another time!
