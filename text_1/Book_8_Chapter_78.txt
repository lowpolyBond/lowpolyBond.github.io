King Dhritarashtra was worried.  He asked Sanjaya, his advisor, "Sanjaya, what happened in the battle?  Bhima, the Pandava warrior, was very strong! He fought all our soldiers by himself! What did Karna, our best warrior, do? What about my sons and our other soldiers?  Did Karna fight bravely, as he always does?"

Sanjaya said, "King, it was a fierce battle!  Karna, a powerful warrior, fought very hard. He told his charioteer, Shalya, 'Take me to the Pancala soldiers!'"

Karna's chariot was amazing! It was painted like a tiger and looked like a dark cloud.  When the Pandavas saw it, they got scared!  Karna shot many, many arrows, hitting lots of Pandava soldiers.

But many strong Pandava warriors surrounded Karna. Bhima, Shikhandi, Dhrishtadyumna, Nakula, Sahadeva, the five sons of Draupadi, and Satyaki all attacked him! They all shot arrows at Karna. Satyaki hit him with 20 arrows, Shikhandi with 25, and others hit him too!

Karna was brave! He laughed and shot back lots of arrows. He even broke Satyaki’s bow!  He hit Bhima and many others. He was so fast, he even took away the chariots of Draupadi’s five sons!

The Pancala and other soldiers charged at Karna. But Karna, all alone, fought them all!  He was amazing! Even the gods were impressed by his skill.  The other Kaurava warriors also cheered him on.

Karna fought like a burning fire, destroying the Pandava army. The Pandava soldiers were so scared they ran away.  The Kauravas were so happy, they played music to celebrate!

But the brave Pancala soldiers came back to fight!  Karna defeated them again. He killed many soldiers. He was like the sun, so bright and powerful, no one could look at him.  He stood there, alone, after defeating so many.  Other Kaurava warriors, like Duryodhana, Duhshasana, and Ashwatthama, fought bravely too, killing many Pandavas.  Karna's sons also fought.

But the Pandavas, including Bhima, Dhrishtadyumna, Shikhandi, and Draupadi's sons, fought hard too, and killed many Kaurava soldiers.  It was a terrible, bloody battle, with many deaths on both sides."
