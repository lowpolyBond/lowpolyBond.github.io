Sanjaya told Yudhishthira, "I have good news!  The Kauravas, Dhritarashtra's sons, are all doing well. They're healthy and happy.  

Some of Dhritarashtra's sons are good, some are not so good.  Even though he sometimes fights with them, Dhritarashtra  gave gifts to everyone, even his enemies! He wouldn't take back the gifts he gave to the wise Brahmins.

You Kshatriyas sometimes hurt people who haven't done anything wrong. That's not a good thing to do! Dhritarashtra and his sons feel bad about hurting you.  They know fighting amongst themselves is a terrible sin.  They've talked to wise people and learned that.

They remember how bravely you and your brothers fought. They remember Bhima's strong mace and the sounds of war.  They remember Nakula and Sahadeva, who are fearless warriors.

We can't know what the future holds. Even though you are a good person, Yudhishthira, you have suffered a lot. But you are very clever, so you will find a way to solve all your problems. You and your brothers are strong and good. You will never choose fun over what is right.

You will be so clever, Yudhishthira, that everyone – the Kauravas, the Pandavas, and all the kings – will eventually be at peace. Dhritarashtra talked to his sons and advisors, and this is the message he sent to you."
