Long ago, there were three brothers: Ekata, Dwita, and Trita. They were very holy men, as shiny as the sun!  They were kind and had families.  Their father, Gautama, was very proud of them.

One day, Ekata and Dwita wanted to have a big party. They needed lots of animals for a special ceremony.  They planned to take Trita with them to help.  They collected lots of animals from their friends.  Trita walked happily ahead, carrying the sacred things, while Ekata and Dwita followed with all the animals.

But Ekata and Dwita were greedy! They saw all those animals and thought, "Let's keep them all for ourselves!" They left Trita behind.

That night, they saw a scary wolf.  Trita, running away from the wolf, fell into a deep, dark hole! He was all alone, very scared. He couldn't get out.  He was sad because he hadn't done a special ceremony yet.

But Trita was clever!  He used his imagination. He pretended the hole was a temple. He pretended a vine was a special plant. He used pebbles as sweets.  He did his special ceremony in his mind!  The gods in the sky heard him and came down to help.  They gave him a wish.  He wished to get out of the hole and he wished that anyone who bathed in the hole would be blessed.

The gods helped him out of the hole.  The water filled the hole!  Trita was so happy!  He found his brothers and was very angry.  He cursed them for being greedy and selfish.  They turned into scary wolves!

Many years later, a strong hero named Baladeva visited the hole.  It was now called Udapana. He gave gifts to holy people and bathed in the special water.  Then he went on his way.  The end.
