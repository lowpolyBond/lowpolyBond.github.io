King Janamejaya wanted to know the special meanings of all the different names for Krishna, the great hero who killed Madhu.  He said listening to these names would make him feel pure and happy, like the moon in autumn.

Vaisampayana, a wise man, told him a story.  Arjuna, a brave warrior, asked Krishna himself about the meanings of his many names.  Arjuna said, "Oh, great Krishna, you are the creator of everything, the protector of all, and you take away everyone's fears. Please tell me what all your names mean."

Krishna smiled. He said, "My names are found in many, many holy books. Some names describe who I am, and others describe what I've done. Listen closely!"

Krishna explained that he was the source of everything.  Brahma, the creator god, was born from a lotus flower that bloomed because of Krishna's power.  Rudra, the god of destruction, was born from Krishna's anger.  Brahma creates, and Rudra destroys, but Krishna is behind it all. He is like the sun and the moon, the wind and the rain. He is everything!

Krishna said,  "I am the soul of the world. I am Narayana, the one who lives in the universe. I am Aniruddha, the source of both creation and destruction. I am Rudra, too, though Rudra is also my part." He explained that Rudra and he are really one, like two sides of the same coin.

Krishna explained more names. He was Vasudeva because he is the home of everything. He is Vishnu because he is everywhere.  He was Damodara because people try to reach him through self-control. He was Prisnigarbha because the good things—food, water, and knowledge—are always within him.  He was Kesava because the sun, fire, and moon are like his hair.

Krishna told Arjuna about the Rishi Dirghatamas who was born blind.  He prayed to Krishna, calling him Kesava, and he was healed. That showed the power in the name!

Finally, Krishna explained that he and Arjuna were Nara and Narayana, two parts of one whole. They had come to Earth to help people.  He said, "I am eternal, and I am the only true refuge for everyone."  Then he finished telling all the wonderful meanings of his many names.
