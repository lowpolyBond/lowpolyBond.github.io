Once upon a time, there was a very brave king named Nala.  Powerful gods – Indra, Agni, Varuna, and Yama – wanted to marry the beautiful Princess Damayanti. They asked Nala to tell Damayanti they were coming to her Swayamvara (a special ceremony where she would choose a husband).

Nala felt shy. He was already falling in love with Damayanti! But he had promised the gods he would help them. He felt he *had* to do it.  He worried, "How can I go into the palace? It's heavily guarded!" But the gods said, "Don't worry, you can do it!"

So Nala bravely went to Damayanti's palace.  He saw Damayanti surrounded by her friends. She was so beautiful, she looked even brighter than the moon! Nala's love grew stronger, but he remembered his promise.

Damayanti's friends were amazed by Nala.  They whispered, "Who is this handsome man? Is he a god?"  Damayanti was surprised too! She smiled at Nala, and asked, "Who are you?  How did you get past the guards?  Why are you here?"

Nala gently smiled back. "My name is Nala," he said. "I'm here for the gods. They want to marry you. Indra, Agni, Varuna, and Yama are all here. You can choose one to be your husband." He explained that the gods helped him get into the palace safely. "Now, beautiful princess, it's your choice!"

And so, Damayanti had a very important decision to make!
