Once upon a time, in a great battle, a king named Shalva arrived on a HUGE elephant!  This elephant was so big, it looked like a mountain! Shalva was angry and wanted to fight the Pandavas.

His elephant was strong and brave. It charged into the Pandava army.  The Pandavas and their friends were scared. They ran away!  Shalva's elephant was so powerful, it made everyone flee.  The Kauravas, Shalva's side, cheered loudly.

But Dhrishtadyumna, a brave Pandava warrior, wasn't going to let Shalva win. He wanted to stop that scary elephant!  He bravely charged towards it.

Dhrishtadyumna threw many sharp arrows at the elephant.  The elephant was hurt and tried to run away, but Shalva made it turn back and attack!

The elephant smashed Dhrishtadyumna's chariot!  Bhima, Shikhandi, and another warrior rushed to help. They shot arrows, slowing the elephant down.

Then, Shalva started shooting arrows too!  Many warriors ran away, shouting in fear.  But Dhrishtadyumna came back, strong and brave. He grabbed his big mace and hit the elephant so hard, the elephant's head broke open.  It fell to the ground with a loud crash!

Just then, another warrior quickly shot an arrow and cut off Shalva's head!  Shalva and his huge elephant fell down, just like a mountain collapsing. The battle continued, but Shalva was defeated.
