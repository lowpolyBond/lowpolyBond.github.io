The Pandava brothers felt very sad.  They had fought a big war.  Many of their family and friends were dead. Yudhishthira said, "We did bad things because we wanted so much wealth!  How can we stop wanting things so much?"

Then, a wise old man named Bhishma told a story. He told them about a king. This king was very happy, even though he didn't have much. He said, "If my whole kingdom burned down, I wouldn't lose anything important!"

The king explained that having lots of things doesn't make you happy.  It's like a cow's horns â€“ the bigger the cow, the bigger the horns.  The more you get, the more you want!  When you lose something you love, it makes you sad.

He said the best way to be happy is to not want things so much.  It's hard, but it's like getting rid of a bad sickness.  The king said to treat everyone kindly, like you treat yourself.  Be good, and don't worry about being happy or sad, scared or brave.  Just be peaceful.

When the king finished, Mandavya, a wise man, felt much better. He learned to let go of his worries and found peace.  Bhishma told the Pandavas this story to help them understand how to be happy, even after all the sadness.
