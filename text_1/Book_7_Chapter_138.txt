Bhima and Karna were fighting!  Karna shot many arrows at Bhima.  Bhima didn't even flinch! He was strong as a mountain.  Then Bhima shot back!  He hit Karna’s big earring, and it fell to the ground like a bright star.  He even hit Karna in the chest!

Bhima shot ten more arrows. They looked like poisonous snakes!  They stuck in Karna’s forehead, but he still looked handsome with his blue flower crown.  Karna, hurt but not defeated, roared back! He shot a hundred arrows at Bhima!

Bhima and Karna kept shooting arrows at each other. It was like a huge storm of arrows!  The sound was amazing!  Then Bhima, with one special arrow, broke Karna’s bow!

Karna grabbed a new bow.  He was so angry, he looked like the sun! He shot so many arrows, it got dark!  The arrows were like a rain of gold!

Karna rained arrows down on Bhima, like a storm! Bhima, still strong, shot back! His arrows filled the sky with golden light. The arrows clashed, making sparks!  It was so amazing, everyone stopped fighting to watch!

Karna tried to beat Bhima, but Bhima was very clever. He broke all of Karna's arrows into pieces!  “Wait!” he shouted.  Then he shot even more arrows!  It was a big, noisy battle!  Gods and magical creatures watched and cheered!

Bhima and Karna kept fighting, shooting arrows at each other.  Then Karna broke Bhima's bow, even his chariot!  Bhima was angry but remembered Arjuna's promise, so he didn't kill Karna.

Karna, remembering what his mother said, also didn't kill Bhima. They insulted each other. Karna called Bhima a "beardless child" who should be eating, not fighting!

Bhima wanted to wrestle Karna, but Karna refused. Arjuna saw what was happening. He shot many arrows at Karna, making Karna run away! Bhima joined Arjuna, and they fought together.  Arjuna’s arrows were so powerful, they flew like angry birds!  Arjuna even protected Bhima. Finally, Karna ran away, and the big battle went on!
