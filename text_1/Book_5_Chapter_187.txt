Once upon a time, in a great battle, there was a brave warrior named Bhishma.  He had a wonderful dream the night before.  The next morning, he fought a very strong warrior named Rama.

They shot arrows at each other!  It was a huge, amazing battle!  Then, Rama threw a super-powerful spear.  It was like a lightning bolt, and it hit Bhishma's shoulder.  Bhishma's blood flowed like a river.

Bhishma was very angry! He shot a powerful arrow at Rama, and it hit Rama's forehead.  Rama was hurt but still very brave.  He got even angrier! He shot a super-duper powerful arrow at Bhishma, and it hit him in the chest.  Bhishma fell to the ground.

But Bhishma wasn't done yet!  He got back up and threw another powerful spear at Rama. Rama was scared for a moment, but his friend helped calm him down.

Rama then used a really, really powerful magic weapon! Bhishma used the same magic weapon to fight back! The two weapons clashed, making a huge bright light!  The sky lit up, the earth shook, and even the gods were scared!

Everyone was worried.  Bhishma remembered his dream. He knew what he had to do. He got ready to use a special, super-powerful arrow. He was ready to end the battle.
