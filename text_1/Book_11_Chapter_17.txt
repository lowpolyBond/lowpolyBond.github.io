Once, after a terrible battle, Duryodhana lay dead on the ground.  His mother, Gandhari, saw him. She was so sad she fell down like a tree falling over!  She started to cry and cry.  She hugged her son and wailed, "My son! My son!"  Her tears fell on his body.

Gandhari then spoke to Krishna, who was nearby.  "Before the battle," she said, "Duryodhana asked me to wish him victory. I told him, 'Victory goes to those who are good and right.'  I didn't worry then. But now, I'm heartbroken for my husband, Dhritarashtra, and all our family. Look at my son! He was so strong and brave, now he's lying here on the ground!"

Gandhari pointed to Duryodhana. "He was a great king, surrounded by friends and beautiful ladies. Now, only birds and animals are around him. He used to be fanned by pretty ladies. Now, he’s fanned by birds! He was like a strong elephant, and now he’s like an elephant killed by a lion."

She continued, "Duryodhana ignored good advice, and because of his bad choices, he's dead.  He ruled for many years, and now he lies here.  Before, the land was full of animals and people. Now, it’s different.  What's the point of my living?"

Gandhari looked around at all the sadness. She saw Duryodhana's wife, crying beside him.  She was very beautiful, but now her hair was messy and she was heartbroken.  She touched her husband's body, and then her son's.  She couldn't stop crying. She loved them both so much.

Gandhari kept looking at her son and husband, and cried, "Oh, this is even worse than losing my son!"  She was so sad, so very sad.  But Krishna told her that, even though Duryodhana had died, perhaps he had gone to a good place.
