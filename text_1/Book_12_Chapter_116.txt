Once upon a time, in a big, empty forest, lived a very wise holy man.  He ate only fruits and roots. He was very peaceful and kind to everyone.  All the animals – even scary lions, tigers, and elephants – were his friends! They would come to him and chat.

One day, a friendly dog lived with the holy man. The dog was very skinny and weak, but he loved the holy man very much.  One day, a mean leopard came along.  The leopard was very hungry and wanted to eat the dog!

The scared dog ran to the holy man. "Please help me!" he whimpered. "That leopard wants to eat me!"

The holy man was very kind.  He said, "Don't worry, little dog! You will be safe."  He waved his hand, and *poof!* The dog turned into a beautiful golden leopard!

The other leopard saw the new golden leopard and didn't attack. They were the same kind of animal now!

But then, a hungry tiger came! The golden leopard was scared again. He ran to the holy man for help.  The holy man helped him again! *Poof!* The golden leopard turned into a strong tiger!

The tiger saw the new tiger and didn't attack either!  The dog, who was now a strong tiger, learned to hunt and eat meat. He lived happily in the forest, safe from other animals.  The holy man's magic kept him safe.  The end!
