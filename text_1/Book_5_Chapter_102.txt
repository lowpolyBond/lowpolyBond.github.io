Deep, deep down under the Earth, in a place called Rasatala, lived a magical cow named Surabhi.  She was special!  She was born from magical drink called Amrita, and her milk was the best in the whole world!  It tasted amazing and made everything better.

Surabhi's milk was so powerful, just one drop created a whole ocean of milk! This ocean had foamy white edges, like a flower belt.  Some very special people, called Foam-drinkers, lived there and ate only the ocean's foam. They were so strong, even the gods were a little scared of them!

Surabhi had four daughters, each looking after one part of the world.  Surupa helped the East, Hansika the South, Subhadra the West, and Sarva-kamadugha the North.

Long ago, the gods and some giants (Asuras) worked together. They used a giant mountain as a stick to stir the ocean! They wanted special things. They got magical drink (Amrita), a beautiful goddess (Lakshmi), a super-fast horse (Uchchhaisrava), and a very shiny jewel (Kaustubha).  Guess what? The ocean water they stirred was mixed with the milk of Surabhi’s four daughters!

Surabhi’s milk was even more magical. It gave different things to different people, helping them live long and happily.

The people of Rasatala even sang a song about how wonderful their home was. They said no place in the whole world – not even in the sky or in magical flying palaces – was as happy as Rasatala!
