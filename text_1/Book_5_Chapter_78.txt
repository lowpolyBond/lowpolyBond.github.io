Arjuna spoke to Krishna, "Yudhishthira already said what needed to be said. But, Krishna, I think you believe peace is hard to make.  Dhritarashtra is greedy, and we are weak. You think strength alone doesn't solve everything.  What you say might be true, but it might not always be.  Nothing is impossible!

You think peace is impossible because we're in trouble. But they're still hurting us, and they aren't being punished!  If we ask nicely, maybe we can have peace.  Krishna, please try to make peace! You're the best friend to both the Pandavas and the Kauravas, like the great god Prajapati is to all gods and demons.  Help both sides! It won't be hard for you. If you try, it'll happen quickly.  You just need to go and talk to them.

If you want to deal with Duryodhana another way, that's fine too.  We'll do whatever you want, whether it's peace or war. Doesn't Duryodhana deserve punishment? He cheated us at dice and stole our kingdom, just because he was jealous of Yudhishthira's success!  A warrior never runs from a fight, even if they know they might die.  When we were cheated and sent to the forest, I wanted to kill Duryodhana.

I understand you want to help us, even if it seems impossible.  If you think we should fight and destroy them, let's do it now!  Remember how Duryodhana insulted Draupadi?  And how we stayed quiet?  Duryodhana will never be fair to us.  Good advice is wasted on him.  Krishna, do what you think is best for us. Do it quickly!"
