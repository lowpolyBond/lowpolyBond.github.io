Once upon a time, a very strong warrior named Karna was known throughout the land.  King Jarasandha, a powerful king from Magadha, heard about Karna and wanted to fight him!

They battled fiercely.  They used swords, arrows, and bows.  When their weapons broke, they even fought with their bare hands!  Karna was winning, about to defeat Jarasandha completely.

But Jarasandha, hurt and tired, gave up. He was so impressed by Karna's strength that he gave Karna a whole city called Malini as a gift!  Now Karna ruled not only Anga, but also Champa.

Karna became even more famous. But sadly, he had a magical coat of mail and earrings given to him by gods when he was a baby.  A god tricked Karna into giving them away!

Later, in a big war, Karna fought his cousin Arjuna. Because Karna no longer had his magical protection, and also because of some bad luck and tricks played by others, Arjuna defeated Karna.  It was a very sad day.

Even though Karna was a brave warrior, many things worked against him.  So don't be too sad, because even strong people sometimes lose.
