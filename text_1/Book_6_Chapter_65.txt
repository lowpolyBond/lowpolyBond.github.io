Once upon a time, there was a big war.  King Dhritarashtra was very scared.  His sons, the Kauravas, were losing badly to the Pandavas.  He asked his friend Sanjaya, "Why are the Pandavas winning?  They're like unstoppable superheroes! My sons are being defeated.  What magic do the Pandavas have?"

Dhritarashtra was worried about his sons' deaths. He felt like he was drowning in a big ocean, and couldn't find a way out.  He wondered what powerful spells or secrets the Pandavas had.

Sanjaya explained, "There's no magic, King.  The Pandavas are strong and fight fairly. They are good and always do the right thing.  They always fight for what’s right. Victory goes to those who are good and just."

Sanjaya said the Kauravas were bad. They were mean and cheated.  They were unkind to the Pandavas many times. Now, they were paying the price for their bad actions.  Dhritarashtra had been warned by wise people, but he didn't listen.

Dhritarashtra's son, Duryodhana, was also upset.  He went to Bhishma, a very wise and old warrior, and asked, "Why are the Pandavas so strong? Even our best warriors can't beat them!"

Bhishma explained a long-ago story.  A long time ago, all the gods and wise people gathered on a mountain.  They saw a shining chariot in the sky.  It was Lord Krishna, the most powerful being of all.  Brahma, the creator of the world, praised Krishna. He is the one who protects good people.

Bhishma said, "Lord Krishna is the protector of the Pandavas.  No one can defeat those whom he protects. That's why they're winning.  They are protected by the powerful Lord Krishna.”  He also reminded Duryodhana that he should have made peace with the Pandavas a long time ago.  Now, it was too late. The Pandavas were winning because they were good, and Krishna was on their side.
