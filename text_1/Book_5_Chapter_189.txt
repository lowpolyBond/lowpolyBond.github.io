Once upon a time, a brave prince named Rama fought a mighty warrior named Bhishma.  Rama was very strong, and he used all his best weapons, but he couldn't beat Bhishma!  He was so sad.  He told a princess, "I tried my best, but I can't defeat Bhishma.  He's too strong, even for me. You should ask Bhishma for help."

The princess was angry. She didn't want Bhishma's help.  She said, "I'll find a way to defeat him myself!"  She decided to become very, very holy.

The princess went into the forest. She didn't eat or drink much.  She stood in the sun and rain.  She prayed very hard to be strong enough to defeat Bhishma. She did this for many, many years!

Rama felt bad that he couldn't help the princess. He told his wise friends, but they said, "Sometimes, even the strongest people can't change what is meant to be."

The princess was so devoted to her goal that the river Ganga, a powerful goddess, spoke to her.  Ganga told her, "Your wish is too powerful. You can't defeat Bhishma. If you keep doing this, you will become a river that only flows during the rainy season, full of crocodiles!"

The princess, even though she was warned, kept on with her hard prayers.  And guess what?  Part of her became a river, just as Ganga said!  Half of her stayed a princess, but half turned into a river, a reminder that even the strongest wishes can't always come true.  She is still remembered as a river that only flows for a few months each year!
