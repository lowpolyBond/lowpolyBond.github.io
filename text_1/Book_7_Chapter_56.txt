Once upon a time, there was a great king named Suhotra. He was so brave and strong, even the gods came to see him!  He was a good king, always asking wise priests for advice. He protected his people, gave to the poor, and fought his enemies.

King Suhotra loved to worship the gods.  He followed all the rules and was very successful.  He was so good, that the rain clouds rained gold! The rivers in his kingdom flowed with gold, and everyone could use it.  The lakes were full of golden fish, crabs, and even golden alligators!  He had so much gold, it was unbelievable.

King Suhotra was a generous king. He gave all his gold away to the priests at a big ceremony. He did many, many good deeds and religious ceremonies throughout his life.

One day, King Suhotra died.  Narada, a wise storyteller, told someone, "Don't be sad! King Suhotra was a much better king than you or your son. He did so many good things, and you should celebrate his wonderful life."  He was a very good king indeed, and everyone remembered him for his kindness and generosity.
