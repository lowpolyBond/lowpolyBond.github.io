Once upon a time, there was a magical fire named Adbhuta.  He was super important! He was the heart of everything, from tiny bugs to giant elephants!  He lived in the water with his mom, Swaha, who was a powerful fire goddess.

Adbhuta was a very good fire, and he helped the gods with their special ceremonies. He carried all the offerings to them.  But one day, he got scared! A very special ceremony was happening, and Adbhuta was afraid of getting dirty. So, he hid himself in the ocean!

The gods were very upset. They couldn't find him anywhere.  Then they found a brave man named Atharvan.  Adbhuta asked Atharvan to help carry the offerings instead.  But Atharvan got very tired and sadly died.

Amazingly, Atharvan’s body turned into amazing things! His bones became tall Deodar trees, his phlegm became shiny glass, and his liver turned into strong iron.  Even the clouds came from his nails!

After a long time, some wise men found Adbhuta hiding. They helped him get better, and he was happy to start helping the gods again.  Adbhuta also made many new fires, and those fires made lots of rivers!

These rivers, like the Indus and the Ganges, were like Adbhuta’s children! He had a big family of fires! All these fires were very powerful, just like Adbhuta. They all helped the gods and were very special.  They showed that even if things get scary, and even if someone makes a mistake, everything can get better again.
