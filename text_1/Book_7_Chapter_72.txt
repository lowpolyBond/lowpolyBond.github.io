The sun went down after a terrible battle.  Lots of people died.  Arjuna, the brave warrior with the monkey flag on his chariot, went back to his tent. He was very sad.  He asked Krishna, his friend, "Why am I so scared?  I feel weak, and I see bad signs everywhere. Is everyone alright?"

Krishna said, "Don't worry, Arjuna. Your brother and his friends are fine. Something small went wrong somewhere else."

Arjuna and Krishna talked about the terrible battle as they rode in their chariot.  When they reached the Pandava camp, it was quiet and sad.  Arjuna noticed something was wrong. He asked Krishna, "Why is everyone so unhappy?  No one is singing or playing music.  The warriors are all hanging their heads.  Is everything okay with my brothers? I don't see my nephew, Abhimanyu. He's always happy and greets me after a battle."

Arjuna and Krishna went into the camp.  Everyone was very sad. Arjuna didn't see Abhimanyu! He asked his brother Yudhishthira, "Where is Abhimanyu? I heard Drona made a big circle of warriors. Only Abhimanyu could break through, but I didn't teach him how to get out.  Did you send him in? Did he die fighting?"

Arjuna was heartbroken. He described how brave and wonderful Abhimanyu was:  "He was strong, kind, and smart. He was brave in battle, always ready to fight. He was like a lion!  How could anyone kill such a wonderful young man?"  Arjuna cried and cried. He felt terrible that he hadn't been there to protect his nephew. He wondered who killed Abhimanyu.

Arjuna asked Yudhishthira, "Did Abhimanyu die a hero's death fighting bravely? Or did he die alone and afraid?"  He was so sad, thinking about Abhimanyu’s mother Subhadra and Draupadi, who loved him very much.

Then, Arjuna heard some of the enemy soldiers bragging about killing a child.  Yuyutsu, a good man on the enemy's side, was upset. He told them, "You killed a child! Why are you so proud?  You’ll be sorry for what you did!"

Krishna comforted Arjuna. He said, "Arjuna, dying in battle is what brave warriors like you do.  Abhimanyu was brave. He died a hero's death.  Don't be so sad."

Arjuna was still angry. He said, "How could my brothers let Abhimanyu die? They were all there fighting!  They should have protected him!" He blamed himself and his brothers.  He was furious and heartbroken.

Only Krishna and Yudhishthira could calm Arjuna down. Yudhishthira promised to tell Arjuna how bravely Abhimanyu fought.  Arjuna vowed to avenge Abhimanyu's death.
