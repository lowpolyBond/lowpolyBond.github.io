Once upon a time, a very powerful god named Indra wanted a beautiful nymph named Menaka to distract a wise and holy man named Vishwamitra.  Indra told the wind god to help Menaka.

Menaka, who was very shy but also very pretty, went to see Vishwamitra. He was busy praying and doing good deeds.  Menaka danced for him.  Suddenly, the wind god mischievously took away Menaka's clothes!  Menaka was embarrassed and ran to get them.

Vishwamitra saw her. He was so amazed by her beauty that he fell in love.  They spent a lot of time together, and Menaka had a baby girl.  They named her Sakuntala.

Menaka, feeling she couldn't raise the baby near Vishwamitra, left Sakuntala by a river in the mountains.  Amazingly, some kind vultures protected the baby from the wild animals!

A wise old man named Kanva found Sakuntala all alone.  The vultures were keeping her safe. Kanva took her home and raised her as his own daughter. He named her Sakuntala because she was protected by the birds (Sakuntas).

Later, Sakuntala learned about her real parents. She loved Kanva like her own father, even though she knew Vishwamitra was her real father.  That's the story of how Sakuntala became Kanva's daughter!
