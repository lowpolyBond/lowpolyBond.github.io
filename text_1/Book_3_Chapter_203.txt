Once upon a time, there was a very strong demon named Dhundhu. He was the son of Madhu and Kaitabha.  Dhundhu was very, very powerful! He prayed to Brahma, a powerful god, and asked for a special wish.  He wished that no one – not even gods or other demons – could ever kill him! Brahma granted his wish.

Dhundhu was angry with Vishnu, a powerful god, because Vishnu had defeated his parents.  So, Dhundhu fought the gods! He was very strong and made them all afraid.  He hid in a cave under a big desert, planning to destroy the whole world!

A wise king named Kuvalaswa heard about Dhundhu.  A holy man named Utanka asked Vishnu to help the king defeat the demon. Vishnu gave Kuvalaswa extra strength.  As the king marched to fight Dhundhu, the sky lit up, and everyone knew that Kuvalaswa would win.

Kuvalaswa and his twenty-one thousand sons dug up Dhundhu’s cave.  The demon was huge and bright, like the sun!  They attacked him with swords and spears. But Dhundhu was too strong! He swallowed all their weapons and breathed fire that burned all the king's sons.

But King Kuvalaswa was brave. Water poured out of his body, putting out Dhundhu's fire. Then, Kuvalaswa used a special, magical weapon to defeat Dhundhu.  He saved the world!

The gods were very happy. They asked Kuvalaswa to make a wish. He wished for good things: to be kind, to help others, to always be brave, and to have a good life. The gods granted his wishes. Because he killed Dhundhu, the king became known as Dhundhumara, which means "Dhundhu-killer".  He became a very famous and powerful king.  And that, my little friend, is the story of how Dhundhu was defeated!  Listening to this story brings good luck!
