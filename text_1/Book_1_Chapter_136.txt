Once upon a time, in the land of Hastinapura, Prince Drona, a great teacher, saw that the princes – the sons of Dhritarashtra and Pandu – were ready to show off their amazing warrior skills.  He told King Dhritarashtra, "Your sons have finished their training!  Let's have a big show!"

The King, who was blind, was so happy! He said, "Wonderful!  Drona, you choose the time and place.  I'm sad I can't see it myself, but I want everyone else to see how strong my sons are."  He asked Vidura, his wise advisor, to help Drona plan the event.

Vidura helped Drona find a perfect, open field.  He picked a lucky day and told everyone in the kingdom to come watch.  The king's workers built a beautiful stage, with lots of weapons, for the princes to use. They even made a special area for the ladies to watch.  People built high platforms and big tents to see the show!

On the special day, the king, Bhishma (a wise warrior), and Kripa (another teacher) came to the field.  The queens, Gandhari and Kunti, and all the other ladies, dressed in their finest clothes, sat in the special viewing area.  Everyone in the kingdom came to watch – Brahmins, Kshatriyas, and everyone else! It was a huge crowd!

Drona, dressed all in white, like a shining moon, came to the field with his son. He prayed to the gods for good luck. Then, the princes, led by the eldest, Yudhishthira, came out, ready to fight!

They were amazing! They shot arrows with their names on them, hitting their targets perfectly.  They rode their horses so well. The crowd shouted, "Well done! Well done!"

Then, they fought with swords and shields, showing their strength and skill.  Bhima and Duryodhana, two of the strongest princes, fought with maces. They were like strong elephants fighting!

Vidura told King Dhritarashtra, Kunti, and Gandhari all about what was happening, describing the princes' amazing skills.  Everyone was amazed by how well the princes fought!
