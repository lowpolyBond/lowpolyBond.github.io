Once upon a time, a powerful god named Indra wanted to meet a beautiful woman named Ruchi.  He went to her home, hidden in the forest.  Ruchi was married to a wise man, but a student named Vipula was living with them.  Vipula had special powers.

Indra looked very handsome. Ruchi wanted to greet him, but Vipula used his magic to keep her from moving! She couldn't speak either.

Indra, in his beautiful form, tried to talk to Ruchi. He said, "Sweet lady, I am Indra, and I have come because of you!"

Vipula, who could see and hear everything inside Ruchi’s body,  kept her from answering.  When Ruchi finally spoke, it wasn't what she wanted to say.  Vipula made her ask, "Why did you come here?"  Indra was surprised and sad.

Indra looked carefully, and he saw Vipula inside Ruchi’s body, like a picture in a mirror! He was scared of Vipula's great power.

Vipula then left Ruchi's body and told Indra, "You are a bad god! You have no control over yourself. Don't ever try this again!  You should respect wise people."  Indra felt ashamed and disappeared.

When Ruchi's husband came home, Vipula told him everything.  The husband was very happy with Vipula and gave him a special gift – the power to always be good.  Vipula continued to be a very good and powerful student.  And Indra learned a lesson about respect.
