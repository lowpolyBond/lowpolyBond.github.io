Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita were very sad.  They bowed down to their father, the King.  Then, they went to see Rama's mother, Queen Kaushalya, who was also very sad.

Lakshmana bowed to Queen Kaushalya and then to his own mother, Sumitra.  Sumitra hugged Lakshmana and cried. She told him, "Rama was born to protect the world, and you were born to help him.  Always be with Rama, my son, no matter what happens.  Always obey your elders."  She kept telling Lakshmana to go with Rama to the forest.  She said, "Don't worry about your father, mother, home, or kingdom. Think of Rama as your father, Sita as your mother, and the forest as your home."

Sumantra, the chariot driver, asked Rama to get into the chariot.  "I'll take you wherever you need to go," he said.  It was time for Rama's exile to begin.

Sita, looking beautiful in her jewels, climbed into the shining chariot. Rama and Lakshmana quickly followed. The King had given Sita beautiful clothes and jewels, and the chariot was full of weapons and armor.  Sumantra drove the horses, who were as fast as the wind.

As they left, everyone in the city was heartbroken.  People cried and ran after the chariot. They shouted, "Wait! Slow down! Let us see Rama!"  They were so sad.  They cried, "Sita is so brave to go with Rama! Lakshmana is a perfect brother!"

King Dasaratha, Rama's father, was so sad he came out of the palace without shoes. He cried, "I want to see my son one more time!" He was so upset he looked pale like the moon during an eclipse.

Rama told Sumantra, "Go faster!"  But the people cried, "Wait!" Sumantra didn't know what to do.  People's tears fell like rain.  Rama saw his parents running after the chariot without shoes. He was very sad but told Sumantra, "Go faster! I can't bear to see them like this!"  His mother Kaushalya cried, "Rama! Sita! Lakshmana!"  The King shouted, "Wait!" Sumantra was stuck between two hard things.

Rama told Sumantra, "If the King asks why you went so fast, tell him you couldn't hear him because of the noise."  Sumantra signaled to the people to go back and drove on quickly.

The King watched the chariot go, feeling very sad.  His advisors told him, "People don't follow their friends so far if they want them to come back soon."  The King, all sweaty and upset, just watched the chariot disappear.
