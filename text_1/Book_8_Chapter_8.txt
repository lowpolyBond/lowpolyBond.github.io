King Dhritarashtra was very sad. He heard that his best warrior, Karna, was killed.  He was heartbroken, because Karna was so strong and brave.

Dhritarashtra said to his friend Sanjaya, "Karna was like a lion!  He was strong and brave, like a bull. Nobody could defeat him in battle! He was so strong, even Indra, the king of the gods, would have been scared to fight him!  Karna's arrows flew so fast, that everyone ran away.  Duryodhana, my son, relied on Karna's strength.  He started the war because he knew Karna was on his side.  But how could the mighty Karna be killed?  He was so powerful! He conquered so many kingdoms – the Gandharas, the Madrakas, and many more! He made them all pay taxes to Duryodhana.

Karna was the strongest warrior in the world!  He was as strong as Indra, the king of the gods. He was brave, like a lion, he never gave up.  Even the greatest kings couldn't beat him. He helped my son so much. And now…he’s gone?  It's like the sun fell from the sky!  It's like the ocean dried up!  It's unbelievable!"

Dhritarashtra cried and sighed.  He said, "Sanjaya, this sadness is too much to bear!  I feel like I'm drowning in grief. I wish I could die. I want to disappear!"  He felt so much pain, that he wished for anything – poison, fire, or even falling off a mountain – just to end his suffering.
