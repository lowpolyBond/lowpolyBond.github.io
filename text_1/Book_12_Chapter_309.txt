Once upon a time, a wise teacher named Vasishtha told King Karala a story about the soul.  He said there's a big, bright light called the Supreme Soul.  This is like the sun, super powerful and always there.

But sometimes, the Supreme Soul hides. It takes on different forms, like becoming you and me.  When it does this, it's called the Jiva.  The Jiva forgets it's part of the big bright light. It thinks it's just a small part.  The Jiva is like a playful child who keeps changing its clothes and forgetting who it really is.

Vasishtha explained that everything is made up of three things: goodness, passion, and darkness.  These things affect the Jiva, making it happy, sad, or angry.  It's like a chameleon changing colors. The Jiva can even understand things that are invisible, but it can't understand the Supreme Soul completely. It’s like trying to catch the wind.

The Supreme Soul, though, is always there, unchanging. It's like the sun – even when clouds hide it, it's still shining. Only very wise people can truly understand the Supreme Soul.

The Jiva sometimes thinks it's just its body. It thinks "I am fat" or "I am small." But that's not really true!  The Jiva is part of the Supreme Soul. When the Jiva remembers this, it becomes free, like a bird escaping its cage.

Vasishtha told King Karala that there are 25 things in the world. Twenty-four are parts of the world, and the twenty-fifth is the Jiva.  The Supreme Soul is something even beyond the twenty-fifth, it's like a secret treasure.  The Jiva can understand the other twenty-four, but only the wisest can understand the Supreme Soul.

Understanding the Supreme Soul is like getting rid of all the bad things and finding the good. It's like understanding that you are part of something amazing and bigger than yourself.  The Jiva forgets this and gets stuck in a cycle of birth, death, and rebirth.  But when the Jiva remembers the Supreme Soul, it’s free forever!

Bhishma, a great warrior, heard Vasishtha's story and told King Karala the same.  He said that knowing about the Supreme Soul frees you from fear and sadness.  Not knowing leads to endless reincarnations, like being trapped on a merry-go-round. But when you understand the Supreme Soul, you escape the merry-go-round and join the bright light forever.  That's the real freedom.
