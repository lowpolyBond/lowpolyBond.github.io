King Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Vyasa, "Grandpa, what bad things make someone need to make things right?  How can they get rid of their bad deeds?"

Vyasa said, "Yudhishthira, you need to make things right if you do something you shouldn't, don't do something you should, or are not truthful.  For example, it's wrong to…"

Vyasa listed many things:

*   "Sleeping after the sun comes up, or going to bed before the sun sets if you're studying to be a priest."
*   "Having bad teeth or nails."
*   "Getting married before your older brother."
*   "Killing a priest."
*   "Being mean to others."
*   "Marrying a younger sister before the older one."
*   "Breaking a promise."
*   "Hurting a good person."
*   "Teaching sacred things to the wrong people, or not teaching the right people."
*   "Killing many animals."
*   "Selling meat."
*   "Selling sacred knowledge."
*   "Killing your teacher or a woman."
*   "Coming from a bad family."
*   "Hurting animals on purpose."
*   "Setting a house on fire."
*   "Being sneaky and dishonest."
*   "Disobeying your teacher."
*   "Breaking an agreement."

Vyasa continued, "There are also other bad things, things everyone agrees are wrong:

*   "Giving up your own beliefs."
*   "Following someone else's beliefs instead."
*   "Helping someone do religious things if they don't deserve it."
*   "Eating forbidden food."
*   "Not helping someone who needs it."
*   "Not taking care of your family."
*   "Selling salt and honey."
*   "Killing birds and animals."
*   "Not having children when you can."
*   "Not giving gifts to the cows."
*   "Being mean to a priest."

Also, it’s very wrong to:

*   "Fight with your father."
*   "Do something wrong with your teacher."
*   "Not having children with your wife."

These are just some of the things that make you need to make things right, my dear Yudhishthira."
