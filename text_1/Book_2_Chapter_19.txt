Once upon a time, Prince Rama was about to become king.  But his stepmother, Queen Kaikeyi, had a secret wish. She wanted her own son, Bharata, to be king instead.  She made the king promise to send Rama away to live in the forest for fourteen years!

Rama was sad, but he was a good and kind prince.  He didn't argue. He said, "Okay, I will go.  I will live in the forest, wearing simple clothes made of tree bark." He even asked that Bharata be brought quickly to become king.  He didn't want any trouble.

Rama was brave and strong, but he was also very kind.  He promised to do anything for his father, even give up his kingdom and his beautiful wife, Sita.  He felt sorry for his father, the king, who was crying.

Queen Kaikeyi was happy that Rama agreed so easily. She sent for Bharata to come and take over as king.  The king was so upset that he fainted!  Rama helped him and got ready to leave.

Before leaving, Rama visited his real mother, Queen Kaushalya. He told her what happened. He also said goodbye to his friends. He was still smiling, even though he was going to a difficult life in the forest.  His younger brother, Lakshmana, was very angry and decided to go with Rama.

Rama left the palace without looking back. He was calm and peaceful, like a wise, quiet man.  Even though he was giving up everything, he didn't change his kind and happy way.  He was a true prince, brave and good. He went into the forest to keep his promise.  He walked away to the forest with Lakshmana, leaving behind a heartbroken father and worried mother.  He was ready for his life in the forest, even though it wasnâ€™t what he wanted.
