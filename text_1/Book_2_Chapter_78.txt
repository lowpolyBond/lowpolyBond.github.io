Bharata was very sad.  Rama, his good brother, was sent away to live in the forest!  His brother Shatrughna was angry.  "Why did Rama have to go?" he asked. "And why didn't Lakshmana, our brave brother, stop it?"

Just then, a hunchbacked woman named Manthara came in. She was dressed like a queen, all fancy clothes and jewels.  But she was mean! The guards grabbed her. "She made Rama go away!" they shouted.

Shatrughna was furious! He wanted to punish Manthara for hurting his family.  He was so angry, he grabbed her and dragged her around the palace! All her jewels flew everywhere, like stars in the night sky.

The other women were scared. They ran to Queen Kaushalya for help.  But Bharata, another brother, stopped Shatrughna. "We can't hurt women," he said. "And if Rama finds out, he'll be sad."

Shatrughna calmed down. He let Manthara go. She was scared and shaking, and ran to Queen Kaikeyi, her mother, for comfort.  Bharata knew that even though Manthara was very bad, it was best not to hurt her.
