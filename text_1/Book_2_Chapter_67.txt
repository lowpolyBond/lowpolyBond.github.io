The night was long and sad.  Everyone in the city was crying.  The next morning, the wise men of the kingdom met.  They were very important people like Markandeya, Vamadeva, and others.

They talked to the head priest, Vasishtha.  "The king is dead!" they said.  "He died of sadness because his son, Rama, went to live in the forest with his brother Lakshmana.  Rama's other brothers are far away.  We need a new king from Rama's family, otherwise, bad things will happen!"

They explained: "Without a king, the land will be in trouble. Farmers won't plant crops.  People will fight.  Thieves will steal.  Women won't be safe.  There will be no festivals or happy celebrations.  Wise men won't get the food they need.  Even elephants won't walk safely on the roads! The kingdom will be like a river with no water â€“ empty and sad."

The wise men said, "A king is like a light. He keeps everyone safe. He makes sure everyone is kind and does the right thing.  He's like a parent to his people.  Without him, everything is dark and dangerous."

They begged Vasishtha, "Great priest, please, help us! We need a new king from Rama's family to save our kingdom!"
