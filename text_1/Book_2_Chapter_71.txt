Prince Bharata, a brave and handsome prince, went on a long journey. He crossed many rivers: the Suddama, the Hladini, the Satali, and the Shalyakartana. He climbed mountains and walked through forests.  He even crossed a river where everything thrown in turned to stone! He crossed the mighty Ganges and Yamuna rivers.  His tired horses and soldiers rested by the Kulinga River, drinking and storing water for the journey ahead.

He rode his big elephant, Bhadra, through a quiet forest.  They couldn't cross the Ganges at Unchudhana, so they went to Pragavata and crossed another river. Finally, they reached the village of Dharmavardhana.  After resting at Varutha, Bharata went east, passing through more forests and crossing many more rivers with the help of strong mountain ponies. His journey was long and hard! After seven long nights, he finally saw Ayodhya in the distance.

But something was wrong. Ayodhya, his home, looked sad and dusty.  He told his charioteer, "It looks like a desert, not the beautiful city I remember!  I don't hear the happy sounds of people. The gardens are empty, the birds aren't singing, and the air doesn't smell sweet anymore."

As he entered the city, he saw empty houses with open doors. People looked sad and wore dirty clothes.  The temples were empty, and the shops were closed.  No one was laughing or playing.  Everyone looked very unhappy.

Prince Bharata's heart was heavy.  He saw his beautiful city was filled with sadness.  With a heavy heart, he went to his father's palace.  The once happy city now felt like a place of sorrow.
