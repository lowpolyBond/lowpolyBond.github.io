Long ago, there lived a brave boy named Bharata. He was the son of King Dushmanta.  Even as a little boy living in the forest, Bharata was super strong!

He played with lions and tigers!  He wasn't scared of them at all.  He'd wrestle big, scary lions and even drag them around! He could even tame fierce tigers! He even wrestled huge elephants! They were so big and strong, but Bharata was stronger. He made even the meanest animals listen to him. The wise people living in the forest called him Sarvadamana, which means "controller of all"!

His mother finally told him to stop playing so rough with the animals.

Bharata grew up to be a very powerful king. He performed many, many special ceremonies called sacrifices. He did hundreds and hundreds of them! He gave away lots and lots of gold and gifts to kind people. He gave so much away, he even gave a huge pile of gold to the man who had helped his mother.  The gods themselves came to his ceremonies! They were so amazed by Bharata's goodness and kindness.

He gave away beautiful horses, elephants, and chariots, plus lots and lots of other things to the kind people!  He gave away so much, it was amazing!  

Bharata was a very good king, brave and kind. He did many good things. He was much better than anyone else.  So even though he died, remember how great he was!  Don't be sad, he lived a wonderful life.
