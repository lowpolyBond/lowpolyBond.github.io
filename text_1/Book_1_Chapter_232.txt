A big fire started in the Khandava forest.  Tiny baby birds were scared!  Their mama, Jarita, was very sad.  She cried, "The fire is so big! My babies are too little to fly away! They don't have feathers yet!  What can I do?"

Jarita had four babies.  Their father had told her that her oldest son would be very important for their family.  He said the others would be great too! Now, the fire was coming closer, and Jarita didn't know what to do.  Should she save herself, or her babies?  It was a very hard choice.

The baby birds saw their mama crying.  They were brave, even though they were small. They told their mother, "Mama, you should save yourself!  If you die, there will be no more baby birds!  Go to a safe place. We are okay."

Jarita looked around.  She saw a tiny hole in the ground near a tree.  It was a mouse's home!  "Quick!" she said, "Get into that hole! I'll cover it with dirt to keep the fire away."

But the baby birds were worried. "Mama," they chirped, "the mouse might eat us!"  They didn't want to be eaten by a mouse. They didn't want to burn either.  They thought it might be better to burn in the fire than to be eaten by the mouse.  It was a very sad decision for the little birds to make.
