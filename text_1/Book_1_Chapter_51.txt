King Janamejaya was very angry.  His father, Parikshit, had been killed by a snake named Takshaka! Janamejaya wanted revenge. He decided to perform a special sacrifice to burn Takshaka and all his snake family.

He told his priests, "I need to get revenge on Takshaka!  How can I burn him?"

The priests said, "There's a special sacrifice, a snake-sacrifice! It's in the old stories. Only you can do it."

Janamejaya was so happy! He thought Takshaka was already burning! He told the priests, "Let's start! Tell me what we need."

The priests measured the ground for the special fire pit. They decorated it with beautiful things and lots of food.  They all sat down, ready to start.

But then, a clever builder stopped them.  He was a Suta, someone who knew lots of stories. He said, "The place and time aren't right!  This sacrifice won't work. A priest will stop it."

King Janamejaya was worried. To make sure the sacrifice wasn't ruined, he told the guards, "Don't let anyone in without my permission!"
