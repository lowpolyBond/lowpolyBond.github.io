Sahadeva was angry.  He said, "The king spoke wisely, but we need a war! Even if the Kauravas want peace, we must fight them!  I saw Draupadi, the princess, treated so badly.  I can't be calm until Duryodhana is punished!"

Sahadeva wanted a fight with Duryodhana.  Satyaki agreed. He said, "Sahadeva is right!  My anger at Duryodhana will only go away if he dies. Remember when we saw the Pandavas in the forest, poor and sad? That made us all angry too!"

All the warriors agreed.  When Satyaki finished, they roared like lions!  They cheered and shouted, "Great job! That's what we want!" They were excited to fight. They couldn't wait for the war to begin!
