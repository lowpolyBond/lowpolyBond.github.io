Once upon a time, after a big battle, the Pandava brothers found Duryodhana hiding in a magical lake.  Duryodhana had used his magic to protect himself from being hurt.

Yudhishthira, the oldest Pandava, told Krishna (Vasudeva), "Look! Duryodhana is using magic to hide! He thinks he's safe, but he won't escape me!"

Krishna said, "Yudhishthira, use your own magic to defeat his magic!  Many great heroes, like Indra (the king of the gods), used clever tricks to win their battles.  Use your cleverness to beat him!"

Yudhishthira then called out to Duryodhana, who was hiding in the lake.  "Duryodhana!" he shouted, "You've hurt so many people!  You’ve killed your own family! Why are you hiding?  A true warrior faces his enemy! Where's your courage?  Hiding like this isn't brave! Come out and fight!"

Yudhishthira went on and on, reminding Duryodhana of his duty as a warrior. He said that hiding was not the way of a brave warrior and didn’t lead to heaven.  He reminded him that many of his family and friends had died in battle, and he should face his enemies rather than hide.

Duryodhana finally answered from the lake. "My chariot was broken, my arrows were gone, and my drivers were dead. I was all alone and needed a little rest. I wasn't scared, I was just tired!"

Yudhishthira said, "We've rested too. Come out and fight! Win or lose, it is a warrior’s duty to fight."

Duryodhana was sad. He said, "My brothers are all dead. This kingdom feels empty without them.  I don't even want to rule it anymore. It feels like a widow without her husband."  Duryodhana said he’d rather live peacefully in the forest than continue this war.

Yudhishthira wasn’t convinced. He told Duryodhana,  "You don't get to give up now! You can't give the kingdom away. You've hurt us too many times! You tried to kill us with poison and snakes! You took our kingdom and were mean to Draupadi! You need to fight!"

The Pandavas kept calling out to Duryodhana, teasing him and making fun of his cowardice.  The great battle was far from over!
