Duryodhana, the Kaurava prince, went on a trip with his army.  They found a great place in the forest, with lots of trees, water, and grass for the cows.  They built houses for everyone, including Duryodhana, his uncle Sakuni, and his brothers.

Duryodhana counted his many, many cows. He checked on the baby calves and marked them.  He even played games with the cowherds and his soldiers!  They all had a big party, with music, dancing, and lots of yummy food.  Duryodhana even went hunting, shooting hyenas, buffaloes, deer, and bears!

After a long time of fun, they came to a beautiful lake, Dwaitavana.  It was full of flowers, birds singing, and buzzing bees.  Yudhishthira, the Pandava prince, was already there with his wife, doing his prayers.

Duryodhana wanted to build fancy houses by the lake. But when his soldiers went to start building, some Gandharvas stopped them!

The Gandharvas were magical beings from a heavenly place. They were having their own party at the lake!  They told Duryodhana's soldiers, "Go tell your king he's silly!  This is our place, not his!"

The soldiers ran back to Duryodhana to tell him what happened.  The Gandharvas were very angry!  They weren't going to let Duryodhana build his houses.  What will happen next?
