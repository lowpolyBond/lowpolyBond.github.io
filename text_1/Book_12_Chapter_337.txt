Once upon a time, a very long time ago, a wise man named Bhishma told a story.  He said that after a very, very long time, a great teacher named Vrihaspati was born.  Everyone was happy!  Vrihaspati was super smart and kind.

King Uparichara, a very good king, became Vrihaspati's student. He learned lots of things, and became the best student ever!  He was so good, he ruled his kingdom like Indra, the king of the gods, rules the sky!

King Uparichara had a big party, a special ceremony called a Horse-sacrifice.  Many important people came, even the sons of the creator god, Brahman!  Lots of people helped, sixteen in all!  This party was special – no animals were hurt. The king was kind and didn't want anyone to be sad.

The king made a special offering to the great god, Hari.  Hari is invisible to most people, but He came to the party anyway, and secretly took his share of the food.

Vrihaspati, the teacher, got upset because he couldn't see Hari take the food.  He threw his ladle in the air!

Then, everyone calmed him down.  Three brothers, Ekata, Dwita, and Trita, explained why they couldn't see Hari.

They told a story about their own journey. They went on a very long trip to find Hari.  They did very hard exercises and prayed for a very long time. Finally, they found a magical island where everyone was pure and white. They all worshipped Hari.

But even there, even after all their hard work, the brothers couldn't see Hari!  They learned that only very special people, those totally devoted to Hari, could see him. Hari is too bright and powerful for most people!

The brothers explained that Hari is amazing and powerful. He is everywhere, has always been, and always will be!  He doesn’t need to be seen to be there.


Vrihaspati understood and finished the ceremony. King Uparichara, a very good and devoted king, ruled his land well. Later, he even went to heaven! Even after some trouble, his goodness and devotion to Hari brought him back to heaven, higher than anyone else!
