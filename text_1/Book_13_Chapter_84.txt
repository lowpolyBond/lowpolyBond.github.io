Once upon a time, in the land of Bharat, a king named Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, about giving gifts.  Yudhishthira wanted to know why giving gold was so special. He’d heard stories about giving cows and land, but gold seemed even better.

Bhishma told him a story.  After Bhishma’s father died, he performed a special ceremony. As he offered food to his father’s spirit, a beautiful arm popped out of the ground! Bhishma was surprised. He remembered the rules: you don't give food directly to the spirits. So, he put the food on the grass, as the rules said. That night, Bhishma dreamt of his ancestors. They were happy! They said giving gold was very, very good. It cleaned away sins, even for their ancestors and future generations.

Bhishma then told another story, about a powerful hero named Rama. Rama won many battles, but he still felt bad about all the fighting.  He asked wise people how to be pure again. They said to give gifts, especially gold!

The wise men explained that gold is super special.  It was made from the power of fire, a very strong force.  They said gold was stronger than cows or land because it held the energy of many powerful things. Giving gold was like giving away all the good things in the world!

Then Bhishma told a story about Lord Shiva and his wife, Parvati. When they got married, the gods were scared! Shiva was so powerful that their child would be super strong, maybe even too strong! The gods asked Shiva to stop the child from being born. Shiva did, but Parvati was angry. She cursed the gods to be childless.  A little bit of Shiva’s powerful energy fell to the earth and became gold!  Gold was the leftover energy from Shiva's amazing power, making it a very special gift.

So, Bhishma told Yudhishthira that giving gold was the best gift of all because of its powerful history and special origins. It was a gift that showed respect and brought great purity.
