Yudhishthira said to Arjuna, "Arjuna, listen carefully! I'm going to leave all the fun things in the world. I'm going to live a different life, a peaceful life."

"I'm going to live in the forest," Yudhishthira explained. "I'll live like a hermit. I'll eat fruits and roots. I'll pray to the gods. I'll be kind to all the animals."

He continued, "I'll wear simple clothes made of animal skins. I'll sleep under the trees.  I'll face the hot sun, the cold wind, and even hunger and thirst. I'll be very peaceful and quiet. I'll listen to the birds sing and smell the beautiful flowers."

"I won't hurt anyone, not even a tiny bug!" Yudhishthira promised.  "I'll only talk to myself. I'll be very simple, like a person who can't see or hear.  I won't care about what others think of me."

"I'll go wherever the path takes me," he said. "I won't worry about where I'm going. I'll only look for food when I'm hungry.  I'll only ask for a little food from a few houses. I won't be sad if I don't get much.  I'll be happy with whatever I have."

"I'll live a long time," he said, "or maybe not. I won't mind either way.  If someone hurts me, I won't get angry. If someone is kind, I won't be extra happy. I'll just be calm and peaceful."

"This world is full of ups and downs," Yudhishthira explained. "People fight for power and things change all the time. Kings get hurt and even gods make mistakes.  I want something better. I want peace.  I want to find a place where I'll always be happy."  So Yudhishthira decided to leave all the things of the world behind to find that peace.
