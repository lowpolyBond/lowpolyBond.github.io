Prince Bharata met a ferryman named Guha.  Bharata explained, "Guha, I have a big army with me.  You're very kind to help us all!"

Bharata then asked, "Guha, how can I get to Sage Bharadvaja's home? The river is flooded."

Guha, who knew the forest well, said, "Don't worry, Prince! My friends and I will guide you. But your army is so big... are you going to see Rama to hurt him?"

Bharata said, "Never! Rama is my older brother, like my father. I'm going to bring him home!"

Guha was happy. He said, "Bharata, you're amazing! You're giving up your kingdom to bring Rama back. Everyone will remember you!"

As the sun went down, Bharata went to sleep. But he missed Rama very much.  He was so sad!  His sadness felt like a huge, burning mountain. His sighs were like rushing rivers, his worry like wild animals.

He was very, very unhappy.  He couldn't sleep.

Guha and his friends came to comfort Bharata.  They hugged him and tried to make him feel better about his brother.
