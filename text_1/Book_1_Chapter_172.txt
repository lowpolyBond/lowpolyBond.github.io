The Pandava brothers, five brave princes, were traveling with their mother. They were walking and walking, day and night!  They wanted to reach a special place.

Finally, they reached a river, the beautiful Ganga.  Arjuna, the best archer, walked in front, holding a torch to light their way.  Suddenly, a grumpy Gandharva king named Angaraparna appeared!  He was bathing in the river with his wives.

Angaraparna was very angry. He shouted, "This is MY river!  You can't be here at this time!" He said only special creatures could be there at night.  He boasted about his power and his friendship with the rich god Kuvera.

But Arjuna, brave and clever, spoke back.  "Who can stop anyone from using the river?" he asked. "Day or night, everyone can use the Ganga!  And we are strong warriors. We don’t care about your rules!"

Angaraparna was furious! He shot magic arrows at the Pandavas. But Arjuna, with his shield and torch, easily deflected them.  He then used a powerful, fiery weapon, given to him by his teacher, and blasted Angaraparna's chariot!

Angaraparna fell from his chariot, knocked out. Arjuna grabbed him by the hair and pulled him toward his brothers.

Angaraparna's wife, Kumbhinasi, ran to Yudhishthira, the eldest Pandava, and begged him to spare her husband.  Yudhishthira was kind. He told Arjuna not to hurt a defeated foe, especially one protected by a woman.

Arjuna let Angaraparna go. Angaraparna was ashamed. He changed his name, because his pride was gone.  To show his gratitude, he taught Arjuna a magic trick – how to create illusions! He also gave Arjuna and his brothers one hundred amazing horses, fast as the wind!

Arjuna wouldn't take the gift at first. But Angaraparna said a friendship gift should be given, so in return, Arjuna gave him his fiery weapon.

Angaraparna explained why he’d been so angry. He said the Pandavas were traveling at night without wives or a special priest to guide them.  This was why Gandharvas like him might be upset. He said it’s important for warriors to have good priests and for everyone to follow rules!

Then Angaraparna explained how important it was to have a wise priest guide a king. And then Angaraparna and the Pandavas became friends.  They learned from each other, and the Pandavas continued their journey.
