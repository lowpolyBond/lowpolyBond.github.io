Once upon a time, in a huge battle, the Pandavas and the Kauravas fought again.  Yudhishthira led the Pandavas, and Karna led the Kauravas.  A super scary fight started between Karna and the Pandavas.  It was so fierce, it seemed like lots of people were going to die!

Many brave warriors fought Karna, but he was strong like a mountain, stopping them all.  Then, Dhrishtadyumna, a great warrior, shot an arrow at Karna and said, "Wait!"  Karna was angry! He broke Dhrishtadyumna's bow and shot back at him.

Dhrishtadyumna got a new bow and shot many arrows at Karna, and Karna shot many back!  Then Satyaki, another brave warrior, also fought Karna.  They shot arrows at each other, and it was a really amazing fight. Everyone watched, their hair standing on end!

Next, Ashwatthama (Drona's son) fought Dhrishtadyumna.  Ashwatthama was very angry because Dhrishtadyumna had killed his father, Drona.  He yelled, "I'll defeat you!" and shot many arrows at Dhrishtadyumna. Dhrishtadyumna fought back bravely.  He even broke Ashwatthamaâ€™s bow!  But Ashwatthama was so strong that he broke Dhrishtadyumna's weapons.

Ashwatthama tried really hard to kill Dhrishtadyumna, but he couldn't!  Krishna and Arjuna saw Dhrishtadyumna in trouble. Krishna said, "Arjuna, help him!"  Arjuna quickly shot many arrows at Ashwatthama, saving Dhrishtadyumna.  Ashwatthama was hurt, and he had to run away.

The Pandavas cheered!  Everyone was amazed by the amazing fight.  Arjuna told Krishna, "Now let's go fight the rest of the Kaurava army!"  Krishna and Arjuna went off to continue the battle.
