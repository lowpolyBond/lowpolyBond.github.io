Prince Bharata was a very good boy. He always listened to his teacher.  He wanted to see his older brother, Rama, very badly.  Bharata's army had set up camp in the forest.

Bharata told his friend Shatrughna, "Go with some hunters and find Rama's home.  Guha, with a thousand soldiers, should also search for Rama. I will walk through the forest with the wise men and people of our kingdom.  I won't rest until I see Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita! I want to touch Rama's feet and put him back on the throne where he belongs!

Lakshmana is so lucky to see Rama every day! Sita is lucky too, to be with Rama!  Even the mountain where Rama lives is lucky!  It's a special place even though it has scary snakes and is hard to walk through."

Bharata started walking. He walked deep into the forest.  He climbed a tall tree and saw smoke!  That meant Rama was nearby! He and his friends were so happy; it was like they had found a treasure!  Bharata left his army and hurried to Rama's home with Guha.
