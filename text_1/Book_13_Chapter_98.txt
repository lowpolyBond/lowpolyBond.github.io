Once upon a time, a wise king named Yudhishthira asked a very old and wise warrior, Bhishma, "What's so special about giving light as a gift?"

Bhishma said, "Long ago, a very good man named Suvarna, who was as golden as his name, asked the same question to Manu, the great leader of all people.  They were talking on a beautiful golden mountain."  Suvarna wanted to know about giving gifts of flowers, scents, and lights to the gods.

Bhishma continued, "Manu said he heard the story from Sukra, a wise teacher, who told it to Vali, a powerful king of the demons. Vali also wondered about the power of these gifts."

Sukra explained, "Long ago, there were magic plants. Some made you happy, some made you sick. The happy ones were like nectar â€“ the sweet drink of the gods! These sweet-smelling flowers make people happy and bring good luck. Giving them to the gods makes them happy too, and they give blessings in return!"

Sukra then talked about different kinds of flowers, scents, and lights. He said the best lights used ghee (clarified butter), and that giving lights helps you see better and be happy.  Giving lights to the gods made them shine brighter!  He said not to steal or put out lights given by others.  Giving lights is like giving a gift of happiness and light to the world!

Sukra also explained about sharing food with the gods and others. Giving some of your food to the gods and needy people makes your home happy and safe.

Bhishma finished, "Manu told Suvarna, Suvarna told Narada, and Narada told me all this. Now I've told you, so you can share your light and happiness with others too!"
