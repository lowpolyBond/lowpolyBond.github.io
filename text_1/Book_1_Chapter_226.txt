Agni, the fire god, was very upset.  He couldn't get rid of a bad ache, and he was grumpy. He went to Brahma, the great god, to complain.  Brahma said, "Agni, I know how you can burn down the Khandava forest!  Two powerful heroes, Arjuna and Krishna, are living there. Ask them for help!"

Agni hurried to find Arjuna and Krishna. He explained his problem. Arjuna said, "I'm ready to fight! But I need some amazing help!  I need a super-strong bow, arrows that never run out, and a chariot that's fast and shiny like the sun!  And Krishna needs a special weapon to fight the snakes and monsters."

Arjuna continued, "I need a chariot pulled by super-fast white horses! My chariot needs to be strong enough to carry all the arrows I'll need.   And I need a bow that's strong enough for my amazing strength!"  He explained that Krishna also needed a powerful weapon.  Arjuna and Krishna promised to stop anyone from saving the forest! They were ready to fight anyone who tried to help the forest animals escape.  They were ready to fight Indra himself, the god of rain! They just needed the right equipment.
