Once upon a time, King Kusika and his queen were taking care of a sleeping holy man, a Rishi named Chyavana.  The Rishi was a very powerful magician!

After a while, the Rishi disappeared.  The king and queen felt very ashamed and tired.  They went back to their palace, very sad.  They found the Rishi sleeping in their room again!  They were surprised!  They gently rubbed his feet for many, many days – twenty-one days to be exact!

One day, the Rishi woke up. He asked them to rub oil on him so he could take a bath.  They did, using the best oil they had.  Even though they were very hungry and tired, they didn't complain.  The Rishi used magic to disappear again after his bath!

Next, the Rishi appeared sitting on a throne.  The king and queen offered him a huge feast:  all kinds of delicious food and treats. The Rishi then magically burned it all to ashes! But the king and queen didn't get angry.  They stayed calm.  The Rishi disappeared again.

Every day, the king prepared amazing food and a comfortable bed for the Rishi.  The king never complained. Then, the Rishi asked the king and queen to pull him in his war chariot to wherever he wanted to go.

The king happily obeyed.  He and the queen pulled the chariot, even though they were very weak and hungry.  The Rishi poked them hard with a sharp stick on their backs and cheeks!  They were bleeding, but they didn't complain.  The people of the city were very sad to see their king and queen suffering.

The Rishi, seeing how patient the king and queen were, gave away lots and lots of treasures from the king’s palace. The king didn't mind at all. Finally, the Rishi was happy. He healed the king and queen, making them look young and strong again. He told them they'd be rewarded for their kindness.

The king and queen went back to the city.  Everyone was so happy to see them healthy and beautiful again. The Rishi, using magic, turned the place where they'd met into a beautiful palace. And that’s how the kind king and queen were rewarded for their patience and kindness!
