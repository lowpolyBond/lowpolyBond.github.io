Long ago, there was a great king named Mahabhisha. He was strong and always told the truth. He was so good that he went to heaven!

One day, in heaven, everyone was worshipping God.  Mahabhisha was there, too.  The River Ganga, who wore a beautiful white dress, was also there. The wind blew, and her dress flew up!  Everyone looked away, but Mahabhisha didn’t.  God was upset.  He said, "Mahabhisha, you were disrespectful! You'll be reborn on Earth, but you'll return to heaven again and again.  Ganga will also be reborn, and she'll cause you trouble, but you'll be free from this curse when you're really angry!"

Mahabhisha wanted to be reborn as a strong king’s son. Ganga saw him and felt sorry for him.  On her way, she met some sad gods called the Vasus. They had been cursed and had to be reborn as humans!  They asked Ganga to be their mother.

Ganga agreed. The Vasus said they wanted to be reborn as the sons of King Pratipa. Ganga said, "That's perfect!"  The Vasus had a special request: "Please throw us in the river after we are born. We don’t want to stay on Earth long!"  Ganga agreed, but she asked that at least one of them live.  They said, "We'll share our power to make one strong son, but he won't have any children of his own."

And so, the Vasus left to be reborn with Ganga.
