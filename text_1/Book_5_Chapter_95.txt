Once upon a time, in a land far away, there was a big meeting of kings.  Everyone was quiet and waiting.  Then Krishna, a very important person with a strong, booming voice, started to talk.

He spoke to King Dhritarashtra, but everyone could hear him clearly.  Krishna said, "King Dhritarashtra, I'm here to make peace between the Pandavas and the Kauravas. I want to stop a big, terrible war.  I have no other reason to be here."

Krishna explained that the Kauravas, Dhritarashtra's sons, were being unfair to their cousins, the Pandavas.  He said, "Your sons, especially Duryodhana, are greedy and mean. They’re ignoring what's right and are hurting the Pandavas."

Krishna warned that this unfairness could lead to a giant war, where everyone could get hurt or die.  He said, "You, King Dhritarashtra, are the most important person here. You can stop this.  Let's work together. I'll talk to the Pandavas, and you talk to your sons."

Krishna told Dhritarashtra how amazing his family is and how everyone respects them.  He reminded him that a great king always does what is fair.  He said that the Kauravas and Pandavas are very strong together and if they work together they can win anything. He said that if they fought together no one would dare to attack them.

Krishna said, "Imagine how happy you'll be if your family are all together and friends. If everyone fights, many people will die, including your sons and the Pandavas. All of them are brave warriors! Choose peace, not war."

Krishna asked the King to be fair to the Pandavas, just like a father should care for all his sons. He reminded the King that the Pandavas had already suffered a lot, living in the forest and hiding for many years because of the Kauravas.  They had been very patient and had kept their promises.

He said, "The Pandavas only want what’s rightfully theirs. Give them their fair share of the kingdom.  They deserve it. Then everyone will live happily ever after!  Think of the happiness!"

All the other kings liked what Krishna said, but they were too scared to speak up while Duryodhana was there.  What will happen next?
