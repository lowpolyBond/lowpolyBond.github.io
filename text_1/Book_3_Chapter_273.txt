Once upon a time, a powerful demon named Ravana was born.  His father, Visrava, was a wise man, but he was sometimes angry.  Ravana always tried to make his father happy. He even sent three beautiful demon sisters – Pushpotkata, Raka, and Malini – to take care of him.  They sang, danced, and made his father very happy.  

Pushpotkata had two sons: Ravana (who had ten heads!) and Kumvakarna.  Raka had twins, Khara and Surpanakha.  Malini had a son named Vibhishana.  Vibhishana was kind and good.  Ravana was strong and brave, but also very proud. Kumvakarna was incredibly strong, a mighty warrior. Khara was a skilled archer, but mean and cruel. Surpanakha was also very mean and often caused trouble.

All the brothers wanted to be even more powerful. They did very hard prayers and magic for a long, long time. Ravana stood on one leg for a thousand years!  Kumvakarna did other difficult things. Even kind Vibhishana prayed very hard.  

After many years, the great god Brahma appeared. He was happy with their hard work and gave them wishes. Ravana wished to never be defeated by anyone except humans – a silly wish, as he thought humans were weak.  Kumvakarna wished for long sleeps. Vibhishana wished to always be good and wise.  Brahma was so happy with Vibhishana that he made him immortal!

Ravana used his new powers to fight his uncle, Kuvera, the king of the demons.  He won and took Kuvera's flying chariot, Pushpaka. Kuvera was angry and cursed Ravana, saying the chariot would only carry the person who killed him.

Ravana became a very powerful king. He was so scary, everyone called him Ravana (which means “the one who causes fear”). He stole treasures from the gods and other demons.  Vibhishana, however, remained good and kind. He became a leader of some of the demons and helped Kuvera.  And so, the story of Ravana, the ten-headed demon king, began.
