King Yudhishthira asked a wise man, "Tell me about King Mandhata! He was the greatest king ever! How was he born, and how did he become so powerful?"

The wise man, Lomasa, said, "Listen! King Mandhata's father, Yuvanaswa, was a very good king.  He did many good deeds and gave away lots of things to people.  But he didn't have a son.  He was sad and went to live in the forest to pray.  One day, he was very hungry and thirsty."

"Yuvanaswa went to a holy place.  There was a special jar of water there.  The water was magic; if a queen drank it, she would have a very strong and powerful son.  But the wise men who put the water there were asleep!  Yuvanaswa was so thirsty, he drank all the water!"

"The wise men woke up and saw the empty jar.  They were angry at first, but then they said, 'Because you drank the magic water, you will have a powerful son!'  They did a special ceremony to help."

"One hundred years later, a baby boy, as bright as the sun, was born to Yuvanaswa!  King Indra, the king of the gods, came to see the baby.  The baby sucked on Indra's finger! Because of this, they named him Mandhata, which means 'he sucked me'."

"Mandhata grew up to be very strong and smart. He learned everything very quickly! He got a magical bow, arrows, and armor.  Indra himself made him king! Mandhata ruled the whole world fairly, just like the god Vishnu!"

"He did many good things, helped everyone, and even made rain when there was a long drought. He was a great king, a very good king, and a very powerful king!"

"Thatâ€™s how King Mandhata lived his life, and that's how he got his name," Lomasa finished.

Then Yudhishthira asked about someone else.
