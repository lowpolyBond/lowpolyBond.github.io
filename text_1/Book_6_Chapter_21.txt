Yudhistira looked at the Kaurava army.  It was HUGE!  So many soldiers!  He felt scared.  "Arjuna," he said, his voice shaking, "Bhishma is leading them. How can we win?  Their army is like a giant wall!"

Arjuna, the brave warrior, said, "Don't worry, brother!  Even a small army can win if it's on the right side. We must fight with truth, kindness, and fairness.  Even wise people like Bhishma and Drona know this.  A long time ago, during a great battle between the gods and demons, the gods won because they fought fairly.  They didn't just use brute strength."

Arjuna continued, "Narada, the wise man, and even Lord Krishna himself say this: Victory follows Krishna. He is always on the side of what is right and good. Krishna is brave and strong, but he is also kind and humble.  He has endless strength, and he never feels pain, even when facing many enemies. He is the strongest and most eternal being.  Because Krishna is with us, we will win!"

Arjuna reminded Yudhistira of an old battle between the gods and demons. The gods only won because they had Krishna's help.  "So," Arjuna finished, "We have nothing to fear!  We have Krishna fighting with us!"  Yudhistira felt much better.
