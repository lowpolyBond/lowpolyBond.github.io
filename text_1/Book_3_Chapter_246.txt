Duryodhana, a prince, told his friend Karna, "Karna, you don't know what happened!  My brothers and I fought some powerful magical Gandharvas.  It was a big battle!  Many soldiers died on both sides.

But the Gandharvas were very clever. They used magic to fly up into the sky and fight!  We couldn't win. We were captured!  The Gandharvas were taking us away in the sky â€“ me, my brothers, our wives, children, and everyone!

Some of our soldiers were very sad. They went to the Pandavas, five amazing brothers who are always kind and helpful. They asked the Pandavas to help us.

The Pandavas, especially the strong Arjuna and Bhima, talked nicely to the Gandharvas.  But the Gandharvas wouldn't let us go!  So, Arjuna and Bhima, and their brothers, shot many arrows!

The Gandharvas were scared and flew away! We were still being carried, but happily now!  Arjuna, who is super skilled with a bow and arrow, shot so many arrows that the sky looked like a net!

The Gandharvas' leader, Chitrasena, came out. He and Arjuna hugged each other and talked like friends.  The other Pandavas hugged Chitrasena too.  Everyone became friends, and the Gandharvas gave up their weapons. Everyone was happy!"
