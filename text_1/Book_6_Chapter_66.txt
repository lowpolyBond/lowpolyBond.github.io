Once upon a time, a very, very powerful god, Brahma, talked to the greatest god of all.  He asked for help.  The great god, in a gentle voice, said, "I know what you want. I will help." Then *poof*! He disappeared.

Everyone was amazed! The gods and magical beings asked Brahma, "Who was that amazing being you talked to?"

Brahma smiled. "That was the Supreme Being," he said.  "He exists always. He is the soul of everything. He is the greatest Lord. I asked him to be born as a human to help the world. He will be born in the family of Vasudeva to fight bad guys called Asuras."

These Asuras were very strong and mean. They were reborn as humans, but the great god would defeat them. He would be born with his friend Nara.  They were so powerful, even all the gods together couldnâ€™t defeat them! But ordinary people wouldn't understand their greatness.

Brahma said, "This great god, Vasudeva, will have a conch shell, a spinning disc, and a club. He is the biggest mystery, the safest place, and the most wonderful thing ever. He has always existed and will always exist. He is called Purusha, but nobody can fully understand him. He is amazing power, joy, and truth!"

Brahma warned everyone never to forget that Vasudeva was a god, even though he looked like a human.  Anyone who thought he was just an ordinary person was very, very wrong. He is the one with the beautiful wheel on his chest, the shining light, and the lotus flower that grew from his belly button. Ignoring him is like walking in the dark.

Brahma told everyone to worship Vasudeva.  Then he went home. Everyone else went to heaven, happy to know this secret.

Bhishma, a great warrior, heard this story from wise people like Rama, Markandeya, Vyasa, and Narada.  Bhishma told someone who was planning to fight Vasudeva that they were foolish. He explained that Vasudeva was the eternal god, the creator, the protector of everything. He was always good and brought victory. The Pandavas, the good guys, were helped by Vasudeva's power.

Bhishma said, "Where Krishna (another name for Vasudeva) is, there is goodness and victory. He supports the Pandavas. He is the eternal god, in all living things. He's worshipped by everyone. He creates and recreates the world again and again."  Bhishma said everyone should worship this amazing god, Vasudeva.
