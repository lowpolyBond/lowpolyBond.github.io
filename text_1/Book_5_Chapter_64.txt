Once upon a time, a birdcatcher set a net to catch birds.  Two birds, who were friends, got caught together!  They flew up, taking the net with them.  The birdcatcher ran after them.

A wise man saw this. He asked the birdcatcher, "Why are you chasing these birds? They're in the sky, you're on the ground!"

The birdcatcher said, "They're flying together now. But if they fight, they'll fall, and I'll catch them."

And that's what happened! The birds argued, fell to the ground, and the birdcatcher caught them.

Vidura, a wise man, told King Dhritarashtra, "This is like your sons.  If they fight among themselves, their enemies will win." He said, "Brothers should be kind, helpful, and talk together, not fight."

Vidura then told another story.  He told of a magical honey on a high mountain.  It could make people young again, heal the blind, and even make people live forever! But it was guarded by poisonous snakes. Some hunters wanted the honey, but they all died trying to get it!

Vidura said, "Duryodhana, your son, wants all the kingdom for himself. He sees the honey, but he doesn't see the danger.  Arjuna is very strong. He won many battles alone. Duryodhana can't win against him."

Vidura warned the king, "If your sons keep fighting, they will lose everything.  Make peace with the Pandavas.  Let them have their share. Only then will there be peace for everyone."
