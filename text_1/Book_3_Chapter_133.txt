Once upon a time, a young boy named Ashtavakra wanted to see King Janaka's big, important ceremony.  But a guard stopped him.  The guard said only important, old priests could go in.

Ashtavakra explained that even a tiny fire is still a fire.  He said even a small, young priest is still a priest. He was wise, even though he looked young.  The guard wasn't convinced.  He challenged Ashtavakra to show his wisdom.

The guard asked Ashtavakra a hard riddle.  Ashtavakra answered perfectly! He used clever words to show he was very smart.  Then, the guard asked another riddle about a wheel. Ashtavakra solved that one too!

The guard tried again with a riddle about something that never closes its eyes.  Ashtavakra answered that one easily as well!

The king, hearing all this, was amazed!  He realized Ashtavakra was incredibly wise, even though he was just a boy. The king said, "You are so smart! You can come in!"

Ashtavakra then wanted to meet a very important priest named Vandin, who was known for his great knowledge and skill in debates.  Vandin had a reputation for defeating anyone who challenged him.  Ashtavakra was excited to meet him. The king warned Ashtavakra that Vandin was very clever but Ashtavakra was not afraid.  He said he would defeat Vandin in a debate.

The king was very impressed by Ashtavakraâ€™s wisdom and confidence.  He let Ashtavakra into the ceremony. And so, the wise young boy got to see the ceremony and meet Vandin, ready for a great challenge!
