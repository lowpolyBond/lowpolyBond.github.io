Bhishma and Rama were ready to fight.  Bhishma was in his chariot, but Rama was on the ground.

"Rama," Bhishma said, "Get in a chariot!  You need armor to fight me!"

Rama smiled. "The earth is my chariot, Bhishma!" he said. "The wind is my driver.  The teachings of the Vedas (like amazing stories) are my armor."

Rama then shot many arrows at Bhishma.  Bhishma saw that Rama was in a super-cool chariot.  It was beautiful, like a magical city! It was pulled by amazing horses and had shiny gold decorations.  Akritavrana, Rama's friend, drove the chariot, shouting, "Come on, Bhishma! Let's fight!"

Bhishma got down from his chariot.  He bowed to Rama, who was like a shining sun.

"Rama," Bhishma said, "Whether you're stronger or not, I want to fight fairly. Please bless me to win!"

Rama said, "That's good, Bhishma.  It's right to fight even someone better than you.  I would have been angry if you hadn't asked respectfully. Go fight bravely, but I can't wish you luck. I'm here to win!"

Bhishma went back to his chariot.  The battle began! It lasted for many days. Rama shot many arrows, hitting Bhishma's horses and driver. Bhishma didn't give up.

Bhishma smiled. "Rama," he said, "I respect your teachings, but I'm fighting you as a warrior, not as your student. I won't attack your knowledge or holiness, just your warrior side!"

Bhishma shot an arrow and broke Rama's bow! He then shot many arrows at Rama, making him bleed. Rama, brave and strong, looked like a beautiful red mountain covered in flowers!

Then Rama fought back.  He shot so many arrows, Bhishma started to feel weak.  But Bhishma felt sad.

"Oh, this is awful," Bhishma said.  "I shouldn't be fighting my teacher! I've done a bad thing!"  

Bhishma stopped fighting. The sun set, and the battle ended.
