Once upon a time, the Kaurava brothers, Duryodhana and his friends, were trying to trick the Pandava brothers.  They wanted the Pandavas all to themselves, away from everyone else.

Duryodhana's father, King Dhritarashtra, had a sneaky plan.  He told his clever advisors to talk about a wonderful city called Varanavata.  They said, “Varanavata is having a big, amazing festival!  It’s the most beautiful festival ever!  Everyone should go!”

The Pandavas heard about this amazing festival and really wanted to go.  King Dhritarashtra saw this, and smiled.  He told the Pandavas, “My sons told me Varanavata is wonderful.  Go there and have fun!  Give gifts to the priests and musicians. Enjoy yourselves!”

Yudhishthira, the oldest Pandava brother, knew Dhritarashtra wasn't being entirely honest.  He knew they were weak and didn't have many friends.  But he still said, "Okay, we will go."

Then, Yudhishthira politely asked everyone for blessings. He asked Bhishma, Vidura, Drona, and all the important people. He even asked Gandhari, Dhritarashtra's wife.  Everyone wished them a safe journey.

The Pandavas prepared for their trip. They prayed for good luck and to one day get their rightful share of the kingdom.  Then, they set off to Varanavata, not knowing the danger that awaited them.
