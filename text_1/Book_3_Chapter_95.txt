The Pandava brothers, with their friends, went on a long journey.  They finally reached a place called Naimisha.  They bathed in the Gomati river, a special, holy river.  Then they gave away lots of cows and other treasures. They also prayed to the gods and gave offerings.

Next, they went to more holy places, bathing in special rivers and lakes.  They were very good and did special prayers and good deeds. They went to Prayaga, where two big rivers, the Ganga and Yamuna, meet. They stayed there and prayed for a long time.

After that, they went to a place called Vedi.  They ate simple food and did more prayers. Then they traveled to Mahidhara, a place made holy by a great king named Gaya.  This place had a beautiful hill and river.  There was a very special lake where the gods lived.  Even the great Rishi Agastya had visited!  All the rivers started from this lake.

The Pandavas stayed there and did a special, long prayer called Chaturmasya.  A huge, old banyan tree stood there.  It was a very holy place.  Many wise men came to pray there too.  They all talked about holy things.

One wise man, Shamatha, told them a story about King Gaya. King Gaya was very generous. He had many huge feasts!  He gave away so much food â€“ mountains of rice, lakes of butter, rivers of yogurt, and streams of delicious curry!  He gave food to everyone. When he gave gifts, the prayers were so loud, you could hear them everywhere! People sang songs about how much food King Gaya gave away.  There was so much food left over after his feasts!  Shamatha said, no one had ever given away so much food before, or would ever do it again. The gods were so full from Gaya's gifts that they couldn't eat anymore!  King Gaya did this many times at this holy place.
