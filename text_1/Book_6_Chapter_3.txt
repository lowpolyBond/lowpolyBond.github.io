Once upon a time, before a big battle, a wise old man named Vyasa saw many strange things.  He told King Dhritarashtra: "Animals are being born all weird! Donkeys are born looking like cows, some animals have extra eyes or legs, and others make scary noises.  Trees are blooming at the wrong time.  Women are giving birth to strange babies! Even the weather is acting crazy â€“ strong winds, shaking earth, and strange lights in the sky!"

Vyasa explained that all these strange things meant a terrible battle was coming.  He said the stars and planets were aligned in a bad way. The sun and moon were acting strangely, too.

King Dhritarashtra was worried.  Vyasa told him that this huge battle was fated, meant to happen.  If the kings died fighting bravely, they would go to a happy place after death.  But Vyasa also urged Dhritarashtra to try to stop the war.  He pleaded with him, saying, "It's wrong for family to fight family.  Try to make peace.  Think of your good name, not just winning."

Dhritarashtra, though worried, wasn't sure what to do. He asked Vyasa, "What signs show who will win the battle?"

Vyasa answered, "If a fire burns brightly and smells good, and if the sounds of the battle are strong and clear, that army will probably win.  If birds sing happy songs and fly to the right, that's another good sign.  Happy soldiers, strong animals, and good weather usually mean victory. But if things are scary and strange, like the things I saw earlier, it means bad things are coming."

Vyasa also said that even a small group of brave, loyal soldiers can defeat a much bigger army.  Winning a battle isn't just about having lots of soldiers.  Sometimes luck plays a part.  Even winners lose some soldiers.  The best way to win is by talking, not just fighting.

Vyasa's words were a warning, a plea for peace, and a reminder that even in war, bravery and luck are not enough. The biggest battle is yet to come, and its outcome remains uncertain.
