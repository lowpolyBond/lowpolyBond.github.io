Once upon a time, there was a wise man named Bharadwaja. He was a priest who did special prayers every day. One day, he came home from his prayers. But something was wrong! The special fire that always greeted him wasn't there.

Bharadwaja asked the gatekeeper, a blind man, "Why isn't the fire happy to see me?  Is everything alright?"

The gatekeeper sadly said, "Your son went to see a grumpy sage named Raivya. A mean monster attacked him!  Your son tried to run inside, but the monster killed him."

Bharadwaja was heartbroken. He held his dead son and cried. He said, "My son was always kind. He helped everyone. But he disobeyed me and went to Raivya's place. That terrible sage is to blame!  My son is gone, and I don't want to live without him."

Bharadwaja was so sad he decided to die too.  He said, "People without children are lucky! They don't know this terrible pain.  I'm so angry, I even cursed my best friend in my sorrow!"

Then, Bharadwaja burned his son's body and then he jumped into a big fire himself, ending his life. He was very sad and couldn't live without his son.
