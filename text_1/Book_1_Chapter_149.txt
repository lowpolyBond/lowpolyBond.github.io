Once upon a time, the Pandava brothers were tricked into living in a fancy house.  The wicked Duryodhana, who wanted to kill them, planned a terrible surprise.  He secretly told Purochana, his friend, to set the house on fire!

But a clever friend of Vidura, a wise old man who helped the Pandavas, knew about the plan. This friend was really good at digging tunnels. Vidura sent him to help the Pandavas escape.

The miner secretly met the Pandavas.  He said, "Vidura sent me!  Purochana plans to burn you all alive on the fourteenth night!  We need to escape!"

Yudhishthira, the oldest Pandava brother, said, "We know!  This house is a trap! Duryodhana wants us dead. Please, save us!"

The miner was brave.  He secretly dug a long, hidden tunnel under the house. He made the entrance look like the floor so no one would see it.  He covered it carefully because Purochana always watched the house.

The Pandava brothers and their mother slept with their swords nearby, ready to fight. During the day, they went hunting in the forest. They pretended to be happy and safe, so Purochana wouldn't suspect anything. Nobody in the city knew their secret plan, only Vidura and the clever miner.  The Pandavas were very clever and careful, and they waited for their chance to escape through the secret tunnel.
