Once upon a time, King Pandu lived in a beautiful forest with his five sons and two wives, Kunti and Madri.  The forest was full of colorful flowers, sweet-smelling trees, and buzzing bees.  One spring day, Pandu and Madri went for a walk.  The forest was so pretty, and Pandu felt happy and loved Madri very much.

He wanted to be close to Madri, even though he knew he shouldn't.  He was sad because a magic spell meant he couldn't have children naturally.  He forgot all about the spell and held Madri close.  Madri was scared, but she couldn't stop him.

Suddenly, Pandu fell to the ground, asleep and never woke up. Madri cried and cried.  She was very sad.  Kunti and the children heard her cries and rushed to help.

Madri asked Kunti to come alone.  She told Kunti, "I need to follow Pandu. I want to be with him even after he's gone."  Kunti was very upset. She loved Pandu too, but she knew she needed to raise their children.

Kunti said, "Iâ€™m the older wife, so I should go with him.  But you raise our children."  Madri said, "No, I need to go with him! I love him, and I can't leave him. Please let me. You are better able to raise my sons."

Kunti loved Madri and agreed.  Madri climbed onto the same funeral pyre as her husband and went to be with him.  Kunti raised all five boys, and they all grew up to be very strong and brave.
