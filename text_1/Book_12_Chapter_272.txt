King Yudhishthira asked his grandpa Bhishma, "Grandpa, there are many kinds of sacrifices.  They all help us be good, but which sacrifice is only for being good, not for going to heaven or getting rich?"

Bhishma said, "I'll tell you a story Narada told me. It's about a holy man."

Narada started, "Long ago, in a good kingdom, lived a holy Brahmin. He was very religious and ate only simple food â€“ bitter leaves and herbs! Because he was so holy, even the bitter food tasted sweet! He lived in the forest, never hurting anything. He did sacrifices to please Vishnu, hoping to go to heaven.  His name was Satya, and his wife was Pushkaradharini.  She was kind, but she didn't like her husband's sacrifices because they sometimes involved hurting animals.  She wore old peacock feathers for clothes.  She did the sacrifices because she loved him."

"One day, a talking deer came to Satya.  It was actually Dharma, the god of righteousness, in disguise! The deer said, 'Your sacrifice needs to be perfect. You should cut me up and use my blood for your sacrifice!' Savitri, the sun goddess, also told Satya to do it. But Satya said, 'No, I won't hurt you, my friend!'"

The deer left, but then came back.  "Please, kill me!" it begged. "I'll help you see amazing things in heaven!" Satya saw beautiful fairies and magical flying chariots. He almost killed the deer, thinking it was the only way to go to heaven.

But then Dharma showed his true form.  "No!" he said. "Hurting animals isn't the right way to do a sacrifice.  Your good deeds went away when you thought about killing the deer. True goodness is not hurting anyone!"

Dharma helped Satya do a new sacrifice, without harming anything. Satya finally understood.  His wife was happy. Dharma said, "Being kind is the best religion. It brings true happiness, not just heaven, which eventually ends."  He taught Satya that the best religion is always telling the truth and being good.
