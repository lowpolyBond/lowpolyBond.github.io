Once upon a time, there was a princess named Kunti.  Her father, King Kuntibhoja, was a very kind man.  A holy man, a wise Brahmin, came to live with them. Kunti promised to serve him with all her heart.

The Brahmin said he would return in the morning, but sometimes he came later, even at night!  Kunti always had delicious food and a warm bed ready for him, no matter what time he arrived.  Even when the Brahmin was grumpy or complained about something, Kunti remained kind and helpful. She served him like a daughter would serve her father.

Day after day, Kunti took excellent care of the Brahmin.  She worked very hard.  He was always pleased with her, just like her father was.  After a whole year, the Brahmin said, "You have been such a wonderful servant, Kunti. You can ask for anything you want!  You'll be famous!"

But Kunti said, "I'm already happy! Your happiness, and my father's, are the best gifts."

The Brahmin smiled. "If you don't want a wish, then I will give you something even better!" He gave her a magical spell.  "With this spell," he said, "you can call any god or goddess, and they will have to obey you!"

Kunti felt a little nervous; she didn't want to upset the Brahmin. So, she accepted the magic spell.  The Brahmin then told the King he was leaving, and *poof* he disappeared! The King was amazed! He was so proud of his daughter, Kunti.  She was a kind and wonderful girl.
