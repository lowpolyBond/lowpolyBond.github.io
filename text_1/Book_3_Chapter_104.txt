King Yudhishthira asked a wise saint, "Why did Mount Vindhya get so angry and try to grow bigger?"

The saint, named Lomasa, explained, "Every day, the sun goes around Mount Meru, a shining golden mountain.  Vindhya, a proud mountain, told the sun, 'Go around me too!' But the sun said, 'I don't choose my path.  It's already set.'

Vindhya got very angry! He wanted to block the sun and moon's path.  All the gods tried to stop him, but Vindhya wouldn't listen.  So, the gods went to a very powerful saint named Agastya.

They begged Agastya for help.  "Only you can stop Vindhya," they pleaded.  Agastya went to Vindhya and said, "I need to travel south. Please let me pass, and when I return, you can grow as big as you like."

Vindhya agreed.  But Agastya never came back!  That's why Vindhya hasn't grown bigger since then.

Then, the gods asked Agastya for another favor.  "There are bad guys called Kalakeyas," they said. "We can defeat them if you drink the whole ocean!"

Agastya agreed.  He went to the ocean with many gods, magical creatures, and even snakes!  The ocean was huge and bubbly, full of fish and birds.  But Agastya was ready for his amazing task!
