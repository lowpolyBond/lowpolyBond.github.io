Once upon a time, in a great hall filled with kings and important people, a brave man named Vaisampayana spoke up. He was very angry.  He pointed at Duryodhana, a selfish prince.

"Duryodhana!" he shouted, "You want a big fight? You'll get one! You think you haven't been mean to the Pandavas? Everyone here knows the truth! You were jealous of their happiness. You tricked them into a gambling game with your sneaky uncle, Sakuni!"

Vaisampayana explained how Duryodhana and his friends had been terribly unfair to the Pandavas.  They'd insulted their wife, Draupadi, and said awful things.  They even tried to kill the Pandava children when they were little!  They had used poison, snakes, and even tried to trap them!

"You’ve been so mean, Duryodhana," Vaisampayana continued. "You won't even give the Pandavas what is rightfully theirs!  You’re a bad king who won't make peace, even though your family and friends beg you to!"

Then, another man, Dussasana, spoke.  He was scared.  He said, "If you don't make peace, Duryodhana, everyone will tie you up and give you to the Pandavas!"  Even Duryodhana’s own family members wanted him to stop!

Duryodhana was furious! He stormed out of the hall, and everyone followed him.  Bhishma, a wise old man, was very sad. He said, "Duryodhana’s anger will bring him trouble. He’s foolish and greedy!"

Vaisampayana then talked to the remaining wise men.  He said, "You need to stop Duryodhana!  It’s better to tie up bad people than to let a big war happen!  Think about it: Sometimes, you have to give up one thing to save many things.  It's better to make peace by stopping Duryodhana than to let many, many people die in a war!"  He gave examples of how other kings had done the right thing by stopping a bad king before trouble started.  He told them they should tie up Duryodhana, and the others who were mean, and give them to the Pandavas to make peace.
