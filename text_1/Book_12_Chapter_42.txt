King Yudhishthira was a good king.  His people praised him, saying he was wonderful. Yudhishthira said, "It's all thanks to my father, King Dhritarashtra. He's like a god to me.  Please, always obey him. I've lost many family members, and I live only to serve him."

He told everyone to be kind to his father. "Dhritarashtra is the king of everything," Yudhishthira said.  "The whole kingdom, even we Pandavas, belong to him!" He sent his people home.

Then, Yudhishthira gave his brothers important jobs.  Bhima became the prince who would help him rule.  The wise Vidura helped with the kingdom's needs. Sanjaya took care of the money. Nakula managed the army, making sure the soldiers were fed and paid.  Arjuna (also called Phalguna) fought enemies.  Dhaumya, a wise priest, helped with religious ceremonies. Sahadeva stayed close to Yudhishthira to protect him. Yudhishthira gave everyone other jobs too.

He also told Vidura and Yuyutsu, "Always do what our father, King Dhritarashtra, wants.  Help the people, but always ask the king first."
