Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana arrived at a beautiful river.  It was their first night in exile.  Rama felt sad leaving his home and family in Ayodhya. He worried about his father, the king, and his mother, who would miss them very much.  But he knew his brother Bharata would take care of them.  Rama was thankful Lakshmana was with them.  He just wanted some water to drink that night.

Rama told their driver, Sumantra, to take good care of the horses.  After sunset, Sumantra tied the horses to a tree and gave them some grass. He prayed, then helped Lakshmana make a bed of soft leaves for Rama and Sita.  They all slept by the river.

While Rama and Sita slept, Lakshmana talked to Sumantra about how wonderful Rama was. They talked all night!

When the sun came up, Rama saw Sumantra and others sleeping under the trees. They had followed Rama to protect him. Rama didnâ€™t want them to suffer. He wanted to leave before they woke up.  He didn't want them to have to sleep outside too.

Lakshmana agreed.  They quickly got into the chariot. Rama told Sumantra to drive south, then back north, to hide their trail.  Then Rama said, "Now, let's go to the Tapovana forest!"

Sumantra drove the chariot towards the forest, starting their long journey.
