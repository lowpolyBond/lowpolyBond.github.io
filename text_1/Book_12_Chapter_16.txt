Bhima, strong and brave, spoke to his older brother, Yudhishthira.  "Brother," he said, "you know everything. We try to be like you, but we can't! I don't want to say anything, but I have to.  You're so sad, you’re letting everything go wrong! You're the best king, the smartest person, but you're acting like a scared little boy!

You know right from wrong, you know the past and the future. I'll tell you why you need to be king again.  There are two kinds of sickness: body sickness and mind sickness.  They go together.  Body sickness makes you sad, and being sad makes you sick.  If you keep thinking about bad things that happened, you'll just feel worse.

Think about your body.  It needs the right amount of warmth, coolness, and wind.  Too much of one thing makes you sick.  It’s the same with your mind. It needs happiness, anger, and calmness.  Too much sadness makes you sick.  You should remember happy times when you’re sad, and sad times when you're happy. But you never seem to do that!

Remember when you saw Draupadi, her clothes pulled off? Remember being kicked out of your house and living in the forest?  Remember fighting Jatasura and the Sindhu king?  Remember Kichaka kicking Draupadi?

Now, you have a big battle to fight, but it's not with swords. It's a battle in your mind.  If you give up now, you’ll have to fight this battle again and again.  You have to win this battle! Fight with your mind, not your body.  Winning this battle is the most important thing. You have to choose the right way, just like your father did, and rule your kingdom well.

Duryodhana and his friends are all in trouble, and now it's your turn to be strong!  Do the horse sacrifice. We're here for you, Krishna is too. Let's do this!"
