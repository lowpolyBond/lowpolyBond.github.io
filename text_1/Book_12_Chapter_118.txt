Once upon a time, a wise old man found a dog that had changed back into its true form.  The dog was very sad. The old man was upset, and sent the dog away.  This reminded the old man of how kings should choose their helpers.

A good king chooses helpers carefully. He looks for people who are honest and kind. He checks if they are truthful, smart, and know the right things to do. He wants helpers who are strong, brave, and fair.  He doesn't pick helpers just because he knows them.  A kind person, even if treated badly, won't try to hurt the king. But a mean person, even if given lots of good things, might become an enemy if scolded.

The best helpers are strong, kind, and calm. They're happy when the king is happy. They know when to do what. They help the king be popular. They're good at fighting and making peace.  They understand people and know how to lead soldiers.  They’re brave, smart, and always do the right thing. They're friendly, and talk nicely. They are wise and good at planning.

A king with such helpers becomes very powerful and loved. His kingdom grows strong and large.

A great king is also patient and forgiving. He's fair, but also strict when needed. He listens to wise advice. He's smart and remembers things. He's kind and helps people in need. He has loyal helpers who always want what's best for him.  He isn't bossy, and he doesn't rush into things. He always rewards his helpers.  He's happy, kind to his people, and never gets angry. He is also fair but uses punishment only when needed. He has spies to help him watch over his kingdom and make sure everyone is safe and happy.

A king who is like this is loved by everyone. He should also have a strong army. Soldiers who are brave, thankful, and know what’s right are very important.  A king with a strong, good army can rule the whole land!  A king who is friendly to everyone and always ready to work hard will become the best of all kings!  Even with only a few brave soldiers, a kind and popular king can win many battles!
