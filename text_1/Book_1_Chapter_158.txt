Once upon a time, the five Pandava brothers – Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva – were hiding in the forest.  They were brave warriors, but they were pretending to be poor.

They walked through the forest, hunting animals for food. They saw many places:  the lands of the Matsyas, Trigartas, Panchalas, and Kichakas. They wore simple clothes made of tree bark and animal skins. Their mother, Kunti, was with them. Sometimes they traveled quickly, carrying their mom on their backs. Sometimes they hid themselves.  They were very clever. They also studied a lot, learning about good and bad, and how to rule a kingdom.

One day, they met their grandfather, Vyasa.  They bowed down to him.  Vyasa was very wise. He knew the Pandavas were in trouble because their cousins, the Kauravas, had tricked them.

Vyasa told them, "Don't be sad.  Everything will be alright. You and the Kauravas are all my grandchildren, but I feel more sorry for those who are suffering. I will help you."  Vyasa took the Pandavas to a safe town called Ekachakra. He also comforted Kunti, their mother.

Vyasa said to Kunti, "Your son Yudhishthira will be a great king.  Bhima and Arjuna are strong warriors.  They will help Yudhishthira rule the whole kingdom.  Your sons will be happy and powerful. They will even have big celebrations and give lots of gifts."

Vyasa then left the Pandavas in the home of a kind Brahmin.  He told Yudhishthira, "Wait here for me. I will return."  The Pandavas all said, "Yes, Grandfather."  And then, Vyasa went away.
