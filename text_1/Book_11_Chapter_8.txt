King Dhritarashtra was very, very sad.  His sons had all died in a big battle. He fell to the ground, unable to move. His friends and wise Vyasa rushed to help. They poured cool water on him and fanned him until he woke up.  Dhritarashtra cried and cried.  He said, "Life is so hard! Losing my sons hurts so much! I want to die!"

Then Vyasa, a very wise man, spoke to him.  "Dhritarashtra," he said, "you're a smart king. You know that everything changes.  Life and death, happiness and sadness â€“ they all come and go.  This terrible battle was meant to happen.  It was decided a long time ago, even before the battle started."

Vyasa told Dhritarashtra a secret.  He had heard the gods talking. They said that Duryodhana, Dhritarashtra's oldest son, was a part of a powerful, bad spirit.  This spirit caused the war and all the deaths.  Even Duryodhana's friends and family were affected by his bad actions.  The gods said the war was unavoidable.

"Your sons did wrong things," Vyasa said.  "The Pandavas, your nephews, were not to blame.  Don't be sad. It was fate."

Vyasa reminded Dhritarashtra that the Pandavas, who had won the war, would be very sad if he died.  He should live on for them.

Dhritarashtra listened carefully. He thought about what Vyasa said.  He was still sad, but he decided not to kill himself.  He would live, even though his heart was heavy.  Vyasa then disappeared.
