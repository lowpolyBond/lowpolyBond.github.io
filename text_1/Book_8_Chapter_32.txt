Once upon a time, during a great battle, Duryodhana, a prince, was worried.  Many of his best warriors were dead.  Only Karna, a powerful warrior, and Shalya, a very strong and skilled chariot driver, were left.

Duryodhana went to Shalya and asked him to be Karna's driver.  He said, "Shalya, you’re the best!  With you driving, Karna can beat Arjuna, the Pandava warrior who's winning the war! Please help us!"  Duryodhana explained how many of his best fighters were gone. He said Karna was their only hope left, and Shalya was the only one who could help him win.

Shalya was angry!  He thought Duryodhana was insulting him. Shalya was very proud. He was a great warrior himself!  He said, "Why should I drive for Karna? I'm better than him!  I should be fighting, not driving!"  He was furious because he felt Duryodhana thought he was not important enough to fight.

Duryodhana quickly apologized. He said, "Shalya, I didn’t mean to insult you! You ARE the best driver! You’re even better than Krishna, Arjuna’s driver.  Please help us win!" He praised Shalya’s skills and explained that he needed Shalya's help to win.

Shalya felt better after Duryodhana’s kind words and flattery. He finally agreed to drive Karna's chariot, but only on one condition: he could say whatever he wanted during the battle, even if it meant insulting Karna. Duryodhana happily agreed. And so, the great battle continued, with Shalya driving for Karna.
