Damayanti was very sad.  She thought the man Vahuka might be her husband, Nala.  She told her friend Kesini, "Go back and watch him carefully.  Don't give him water or fire right away.  See if he does anything amazing. Tell me everything!"

Kesini went back and watched Vahuka. She saw amazing things!  He didn't even need to bend down to go under low doorways; the doorways got taller!  Narrow spaces opened wide for him.  When he washed meat, the water filled the bowls all by itself!  He made fire from just a bit of grass!  He touched fire and wasn't burned! He even made water flow like a river just by wishing! And when he touched flowers, they became even more beautiful and smelled even better!  Kesini was amazed! She rushed back to tell Damayanti.

Damayanti was overjoyed!  She knew Vahuka was Nala!  She told Kesini, "Go get some of the meat Vahuka cooked, without him seeing you."

Kesini got the meat. Damayanti tasted it.  It tasted exactly like Nala's cooking! She cried tears of joy and sadness. She sent her two children to see Vahuka.

Vahuka saw the children and knew they were his.  He hugged them tightly and cried. But then he said to Kesini, "These children look just like mine. Seeing them surprised me, that's why I cried. If you keep visiting, people will talk. We are guests here." He didn't want anyone to know he was really King Nala yet.
