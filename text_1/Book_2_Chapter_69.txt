Prince Bharata had a very bad dream.  It was so scary that he was sad all morning! His friends tried to cheer him up. They sang songs, told jokes, and even danced!  But nothing worked.  Bharata was still very upset.

"Why are you so sad?" his friends asked.

Bharata sighed. "I had a terrible dream," he said. "I saw my father, the king, looking all messy and falling off a mountain into a pile of cow dung!  He was covered in oil, eating messy food, and looked very unhappy.

"In my dream, the ocean disappeared, the moon fell down, and the world went dark. The elephants' tusks broke, and a big fire went out. The ground cracked open, the trees lost their leaves, and even the mountains smoked!

"I saw my father sitting on a hard, black chair.  Women in black and yellow clothes were teasing him. Then he was in a cart pulled by donkeys, wearing black clothes! A scary monster laughed at him. It was a terrible dream!"

Bharata shivered. "This dream means someone is going to die," he said, sadly. "It could be me, my brother Rama, Lakshmana, or even my father!  I'm so scared. My heart is pounding, and I can't stop worrying."
