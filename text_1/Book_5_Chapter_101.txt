Once upon a time, a wise man named Narada told a story.  He said, "There's a land full of amazing birds!  These birds have beautiful feathers. They eat snakes for food.  They're strong and can fly far and carry heavy things without getting tired.

These birds are all related.  They’re the grandchildren of a great bird named Garuda.  Six of Garuda’s sons had lots and lots of babies, and now there are thousands of bird families!  They are very proud and powerful, like kings and queens. They even have a special mark, like a lucky charm, on their bodies.  But they are not kind. Because they eat snakes, they can’t be truly happy inside.

Narada then listed some of the bird chiefs’ names:  Sumukha, Sunaman, Sunetra, and many, many more!  There were so many brave and famous birds!  He said, "These birds are special because the great god Vishnu protects them. Vishnu lives in their hearts."

Narada was talking to Matali, who was looking for a husband for his daughter.  Narada said, "If you don't like any of these bird kings, let's go find someone else!"  And so their adventure continued.
