Karna, a great warrior, was lying dead on the battlefield. He was brave and strong like a burning fire, but now he was gone.  Arjun, a powerful warrior, had defeated him.  Karna had fought bravely, killing many enemies.  But now, he lay still and covered in blood.

Karna’s brothers fought bravely, too, but they were scared of the Pandavas. They followed Karna like elephants following their leader. But sadly, Karna, strong as a tiger or an elephant, was defeated like those animals.

Karna’s wives were very sad. They cried and wailed around his body.  Even King Yudhisthira, a good and kind king, couldn't sleep for many years because he worried about what happened. Karna was so strong and unbeatable; he was like a huge, strong mountain!  He protected Duryodhana, one of the Kauravas.  Now, he lay still like a tree blown down by the wind.

Karna’s wife was heartbroken.  She cried and cried.  She blamed a curse for his death. She remembered how Arjun’s arrow made Karna’s chariot wheel sink into the ground, leaving him helpless. She was so sad!  She fell to the ground again and again.  She touched his face. Even animals were eating Karna’s body.  It was a very sad sight. His wife was heartbroken because her husband and her son were both gone. She was so sad; she kept falling to the ground. She wanted to be close to her husband.
