King Janamejaya was curious.  "Why is that special place called Seven Saraswatis?" he asked. "Who was the wise man Mankanaka?  How did he become so amazing? What did he do? Where did he come from? What did he study?"

Vaishampayana, a wise storyteller, answered, "King, imagine seven magical rivers, all named Saraswati! Whenever powerful people needed help, a Saraswati would appear.  There were Suprava, Kanchanakshi, Visala, Manorama, Oghavati, Surenu, and Vimalodaka.

Long ago, a very big party was happening!  Gods and wise people came together for a huge ceremony. It was so wonderful, even the gods were amazed!  Everyone was happy and had everything they needed.  But the wise people said, “This party isn't complete!  The Saraswati River isn't here!”

So, they thought of the river, and *poof*! Suprava, a form of the Saraswati, appeared! Everyone was very happy. This happened again and again in different places.  Each time, the Saraswati appeared in a new form – Kanchanakshi, Visala, Manorama, Oghavati, and Surenu. The seventh appeared when the great god Brahman had a party.

Finally, all seven rivers came together in one special place. That's why it's called Sapta Saraswati (Seven Saraswatis)."

Then Vaishampayana told a story about Mankanaka.  Mankanaka was a very, very good person. One day, while washing himself in the river, he saw a woman bathing.  He was so surprised that some of his special energy fell into the river.

He picked it up and put it in a pot.  Amazingly, the energy split into seven parts! Seven wise men were born from it, and they had many sons!

Later, Mankanaka got hurt.  Instead of blood, a clear liquid came out of his wound. He was so happy, he started dancing!  Everyone, even animals, started dancing too!

The gods went to the great god Mahadeva and said, "Make him stop dancing!" Mahadeva talked to Mankanaka.  Mahadeva showed him something amazing: when *he* got hurt, ash came out!  Mankanaka felt embarrassed.

He realized Mahadeva was a very powerful god.  He asked Mahadeva not to take away his goodness.  Mahadeva said, “Your goodness will grow even stronger!  And I will always be with you. Anyone who prays to me at Sapta Saraswati will get everything they want!"

Mankanaka was very special, Vaishampayana explained. He was the son of the wind god and a woman named Sukanya.  And that’s the story of Mankanaka and the Seven Saraswatis.
