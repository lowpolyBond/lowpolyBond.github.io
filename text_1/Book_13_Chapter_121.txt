Once upon a time, in the land of ancient India, a wise man named Vyasa talked to another wise man, Maitreya. Maitreya was very rich and kind.

Vyasa said, "Maitreya, I have something important to tell you about giving gifts."

Maitreya said, "I'm listening, wise Vyasa. Tell me what you know."

Vyasa explained how important it is to give gifts to good people.

Maitreya replied, "You're so right! Giving to good people brings happiness.  I've learned so much from you, just by seeing you."

Maitreya then said, "Being a good person is very important. It's like planting seeds in a field.  If you plant good seeds (like doing good things, learning, and being kind), you'll have a good harvest (happiness and good things in life). Three things make a truly good person:  being born into a good family, studying the holy books (like the Vedas), and doing lots of good deeds.  These people are called Brahmins. When you give to a good Brahmin, it's like planting the best seeds!"

He continued, "Giving to a Brahmin who knows the Vedas is the best thing you can do.  It's like shining a light in the dark. Without good Brahmins, the world would be lost!  They teach us right from wrong, and show us the way to be good. Giving to a good Brahmin is like getting a great reward; both the giver and the receiver get blessings!"

Maitreya added, "If you give to someone who isn't good, it's like throwing seeds on rocksâ€”nothing grows.  It doesn't help anyone.  But if you give to a wise Brahmin, they use that gift to help others, and everyone benefits! These good people lead us to happiness, here and in the afterlife. They are like shining stars, guiding everyone on the right path!"
