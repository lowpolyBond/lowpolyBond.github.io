Once upon a time, during a great battle, a brave warrior named Satyaki fought very bravely. He defeated many enemies, including Bhurisravas, the son of Somadatta.

Somadatta was furious! He shouted at Satyaki, "You are not a fair fighter!  You attacked Bhurisravas while he was hurt and defenseless!  Real warriors don't do that! I will avenge my son! I swear, before the night ends, I will kill you!" Somadatta blew his horn, sounding like a lion's roar, and challenged Satyaki to a duel.

Satyaki, a strong warrior with eyes like lotus flowers, was not scared. He answered, "I am always a fair fighter.  Your words don't frighten me.  If you want to fight, let's do it! I already defeated your son, and I will defeat you too!"

The two warriors fought fiercely.  Somadatta and his army fought hard against Satyaki and his friends. Many arrows flew back and forth!  Somadatta got badly hurt and fainted. His driver quickly took him away.

Then, another powerful warrior, Drona, entered the battle.  He attacked Satyaki and the Pandava army. Drona was so strong, he almost defeated everyone!  He hurt many Pandava warriors, including Yudhishthira, Bhima, and others.  The Pandavas’ army started running away!

Arjuna, a very brave warrior, saw this and wanted to help.  He asked his friend Krishna to help.  Bhima, another strong Pandava brother, also went to fight Drona.  Many other warriors joined them.  The battle became even bigger and louder!

On that same night, another amazing battle happened.  Aswatthaman, Drona’s son, wanted revenge for Satyaki killing Bhurisravas.  Ghatotkacha, a huge and strong Rakshasa (a kind of demon), stepped in to defend the Pandavas.  Ghatotkacha's chariot was enormous and scary!

Ghatotkacha and Aswatthaman fought fiercely.  Ghatotkacha's magic illusions and powerful attacks surprised everyone. Aswatthaman fought bravely, too,  defeating Ghatotkacha’s illusions and even killing Ghatotkacha’s son.  Ghatotkacha, sad and angry about the death of his son, fought back even harder.

Aswatthaman was very powerful too! He used amazing weapons to defeat Ghatotkacha’s attacks.  He even destroyed the illusions Ghatotkacha created.

The fight between Aswatthaman and Ghatotkacha was wild and full of magic. The sky lit up with the sparks from their weapons.  Finally, Aswatthaman defeated Ghatotkacha with a powerful weapon.


Then, Duryodhana, the leader of the Kauravas, worried, asked Aswatthaman to protect his army. Aswatthaman, very brave, promised he would defeat the Pandavas.  He kept fighting, defeating many enemies.

The battle raged on.  The whole night was filled with the sounds of clashing weapons, screams and roars.  Aswatthaman's amazing strength and skill helped the Kauravas, but in the end, the battle was still very hard fought.  It was an incredibly fierce and unforgettable night of fighting!
