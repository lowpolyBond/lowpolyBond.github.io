Once upon a time, a long, long time ago, there was a king named Parikshit. He loved to hunt. One day, while chasing a deer, he got lost in a big, dark forest.  He was tired, hungry, and thirsty.

He found a pretty pond and took a bath with his horse.  While resting, he heard beautiful music. He looked around and saw a lovely girl picking flowers and singing.

He asked her to marry him.  She said, "Only if you promise never to make me look at water."  The king agreed, and they were married. They lived happily for a while, but the king's people couldn't see him.

His wise advisor figured out what was going on. He built a secret garden with a hidden pond, sparkling like jewels. He told the king, "Look! A beautiful garden, but no water!"  The king and his wife went to the garden.  They found the hidden pond.

The king said, "My darling, come swim!"  She jumped in, but she disappeared! The king searched and found a frog near a hole.  He got very angry and ordered all the frogs to be killed!

Suddenly, a frog, dressed like a wise man, appeared.  He was Ayu, the frog king, and the girl was his daughter, Susobhana. She was a trickster who had fooled many kings before.

Ayu told Parikshit the truth.  Parikshit was sad but got his daughter back. Ayu warned Susobhana, "Because you tricked so many kings, your children will be disrespectful to wise people."

Parikshit and Susobhana had three sons.  The oldest, Sala, was a hunter. He wanted a magical horse from a wise man named Vamadeva.  Vamadeva lent him the horses but asked for them back.

Sala refused to return the horses, saying wise men didn't need such fast horses.  Vamadeva got angry. He told Sala, “If you don’t return my horses, I will send powerful monsters to get you.”

Sala still refused. The monsters attacked and killed him.  Sala’s brother Dala became king.  Vamadeva asked Dala for the horses.  Dala also refused and even tried to kill Vamadeva with a poisoned arrow!

But Vamadeva was very powerful. He told Dala to use the arrow to kill his own son instead! Dala did this in fear.  Dala’s queen begged Vamadeva to forgive them. She promised to always respect wise people.

Vamadeva was pleased.  He forgave them and took back his magical horses.  Dala learned a very important lesson: Always respect wise people!  And that’s how everyone learned about the importance of being kind and respectful to others, especially wise people.
