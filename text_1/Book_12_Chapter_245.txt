Once upon a time, Suka asked a wise old man named Vyasa, "How can someone become truly wise and peaceful?"

Vyasa smiled. "First," he said, "you need to live a good life.  You learn and grow, then you start a family and learn more.  After that, you can focus on becoming truly peaceful."

"To do this," Vyasa continued, "you need to be alone.  You should think of everything as part of yourself. Don't throw anything away, because everything is connected.  Live simply. Don't have a home. Just ask for food when you need it. Don't keep food for tomorrow. Pray and be peaceful.  Eat only a little, once a day."

Vyasa described the life of a peaceful person: "They wear simple clothes, sleep under trees, and are happy alone.  They don't listen to gossip, especially about kind people. If someone says bad things about them, they just stay quiet. They are like the calm morning sky. Even in a crowded place, they feel peaceful."

"A truly peaceful person," Vyasa explained, "is happy with whatever they have. They aren't afraid of being alone, or of not having lots of delicious food, or of spending time with women. They're neither happy when praised nor sad when criticized. They are kind to everyone. They don't fear death or love life too much; they just wait for their time to come."

"This peaceful person," Vyasa said, "doesn't hurt anyone. They treat everyone the same. They tell the truth and are brave. They protect everyone they can.  They know themselves so well, that death cannot touch them. They don't want anything, so they have nothing to fear."

Vyasa finished, "This person lives a long, happy life. They don't hurt anyone, and they are kind to all. They are the wisest of all, truly connected to everything."  He said that the kindest thing is to never hurt anyone, and that's the best way to become truly wise and peaceful.  Only then will you truly understand the world.
