Once upon a time, in the land of Hastinapura, there was a big family fight.  The Pandavas and the Kauravas were cousins, but they didn't get along.  A wise old man named Bhishma heard about the trouble. He was very happy the Pandavas were safe and had friends.  He thought they should be given back their land. He said, “Arjuna, one of the Pandavas, is a super strong warrior! Nobody can beat him in a fight!”

But Karna, who was on the Kauravas' side, got angry. He shouted, “Everyone knows that! Why are we talking about it again and again?  The Pandavas lost their kingdom in a game. They have to follow the rules and stay in the forest as they agreed.  If they want their land back, they should wait. If they want to fight, then let them fight, and they will be sorry!”

Bhishma, the wise old man, said, “Karna, you forget how strong Arjuna is!  He defeated six warriors all by himself! If we don't listen to what the wise man said, Arjuna will defeat us all in battle!”

The king, Dhritarashtra, listened to both sides. He told Karna to be quiet. He agreed with Bhishma. He said, “Bhishma is right. Let's send a messenger to the Pandavas to talk things over.”  The king sent a message to the Pandavas, asking them to be peaceful.
