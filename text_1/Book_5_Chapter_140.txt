King Dhritarashtra was worried. He asked his advisor, Sanjaya, "Sanjaya, Krishna, the mighty warrior, just spoke to Karna!  What did he say?  Was he nice or mean?"

Sanjaya said, "Don't worry, King. I'll tell you exactly what Krishna said.  It was both kind and strong, true and helpful."

Krishna said to Karna, "Karna, you've learned much about right and wrong. You know the sacred scriptures well.  The scriptures say that a child born to a woman who is not married is the son of the man who later marries her.  That means you are Pandu's son!  Become a king with your brothers, the Pandavas! They’re your family too!

Think of it: the Pandavas will welcome you as their brother.  All the kings and warriors fighting for them will bow to you.  You’ll have a grand ceremony.  Draupadi will even marry you.  Yudhishthira, the eldest Pandava, will be your advisor. Bhimasena will hold an umbrella over you.  Arjuna will drive your beautiful chariot, pulled by white horses.  Nakula, Sahadeva, and Draupadi's sons will follow you.  I, Krishna, and all my friends will be there too!  Rule the world with your brothers, with happiness and peace. Let everyone celebrate!"
