King Yudhishthira went on a long journey. He visited many special places near the ocean. These places were very holy, and many priests went there to pray.

Yudhishthira and his brothers took baths in the holy water.  They gave gifts to important people.  They went to a special river, the holiest of all.  There, they prayed to their ancestors and the gods.  Then they went to the Godavari River, which flows into the sea. This washed away their bad deeds.

They visited a very pure place called Agastya's spot. They heard a story about Arjuna, the best archer ever!  Everyone praised the brave Pandavas. Yudhishthira and Krishna spent time together, talking about how amazing Arjuna was.  They gave away many cows.

Yudhishthira visited many more holy places.  He finally reached Suparaka, the holiest of them all.  He then went to a forest where gods and great kings had worshipped long ago. He saw a special altar built by a famous archer.

He saw temples for many gods: the Vasus, wind gods, the healers, Yama, Indra, Vishnu, the Creator, Shiva, the Moon god, the Sun god, the Water god, Brahma, and many, many more! He prayed and gave away lots of precious jewels. He bathed in the holy waters and returned to Suparaka.

From there, he went to Prabhasa, another very famous holy place. He, his brothers, Krishna, and many priests cleaned themselves in the holy waters and prayed. For twelve days, he only ate and drank a little. He prayed and did very hard religious exercises.

Krishna and Balarama heard about Yudhishthiraâ€™s hard work. They came to see him with their army.  They found the Pandavas looking very thin and tired.  Draupadi, their wife, was also sad. The Vrishnis cried to see them suffering.

Yudhishthira happily greeted Krishna, Balarama and others. They all greeted each other warmly.  Yudhishthira told them about his enemies and how hard his life had been in the forest. He told them about Arjuna's amazing training with the gods.  Everyone was happy to hear his stories. But seeing how thin and weak the Pandavas were made the strong Vrishnis cry.
