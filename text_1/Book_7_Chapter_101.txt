King Vasudeva looked at Arjuna (also called Partha and Dhananjaya).  "Look at Duryodhana!" he said. "He's been so mean to us! He's a super strong warrior.  He's a great archer, and very hard to beat. He's rich and everyone admires him, but he hates the Pandavas!  Arjuna, you must fight him!  Winning or losing this war depends on him. Let your anger out! He’s the reason for all our problems. He’s right there!  Fight him!"

Vasudeva explained that Duryodhana was spoiled and didn’t know how amazing Arjuna was.  "Arjuna, even gods and giants can't defeat you!  Duryodhana is just one man.  It's our lucky chance to fight him!  Fight him like Indra, the king of the gods, fought the evil Vritra!"

Vasudeva reminded Arjuna of how Duryodhana cheated them in a game, taking away their kingdom and forcing them to live in the forest. He reminded him of all the terrible things Duryodhana did. "He’s cruel and greedy," Vasudeva said. "Remember everything he did!  He’s right there!  Kill him!"

Arjuna said, "I will!  I’ll kill him.  I'll cut off the head of that man who stole our kingdom for so long.  I'll avenge the terrible insult he gave Draupadi!"

Arjuna and Krishna (Keshava) raced towards Duryodhana.  Duryodhana wasn't scared!  The Kaurava army cheered for him.  Duryodhana and Arjuna glared at each other, so angry they roared!  They blew their horns, and the Kauravas got scared. They thought Duryodhana was going to die.  The Kaurava soldiers cried, "The king is dead! The king is dead!"

Duryodhana shouted, "Don't worry! I'll defeat them!" He turned to Arjuna and said, "Arjuna, since you're Pandu’s son, use all your amazing weapons, all the magical ones and the normal ones. Show me how strong you really are! I want to see your best!"
