Once upon a time, a powerful snake named Vasuki and his brothers were in big trouble.  Their mother had put a terrible curse on them!  Vasuki and his siblings needed to figure out a way to stop the curse from coming true.

Vasuki called a family meeting. "This curse is awful!" he hissed. "But maybe we can fix it!  Curses can be stopped, but not one from our mother. We have to act fast!"

The snakes talked and talked. Some had sneaky ideas. "Let's pretend to be wise priests!" one suggested. "We'll tell King Janamejaya he shouldn't have his big snake-killing ceremony!"

Others were even trickier. "We'll become the king's best advisors!" another snake slithered.  "Then we'll give him bad advice, so he'll stop the ceremony!"

Some snakes had mean plans. "Let's bite the king's helpers!" hissed one.  "Or maybe we can bite the king himself!"

But other snakes were nicer. "That's wrong!" they said. "Killing people is bad. We need to find a better way."

One group suggested making it rain during the ceremony to put out the fire.  Another thought they could steal the special juice needed for the ritual.  Yet another decided theyâ€™d bite everyone at the ceremony to scare them off.  A few even planned to use their poo to make the food dirty!  Some even thought they could kidnap the King while he was swimming!

Finally, Vasuki spoke. "I don't like any of these ideas," he said.  "They're all too mean.  Maybe we should ask our father, Kasyapa, for help. He's very powerful. He might know what to do."  Vasuki was worried. He had to find a way to save his family. He needed a good plan, and quickly!
