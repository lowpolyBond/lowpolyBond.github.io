Rama and Sita were living happily in the forest of Chitrakuta.  One day, Rama noticed that the wise holy men who lived there looked worried. They whispered to each other and seemed scared.

Rama asked them, "What's wrong?  Is something troubling you? Did I do something wrong? Did Lakshmana, my brother, hurt you? Did Sita, my wife, upset you?"

An old, thin holy man, trembled as he spoke. "No, Sita is wonderful.  It's the evil Asuras! They're angry with you, Rama.  They are hurting us!"

"Kara, Ravana's brother, is chasing us away from our homes," the holy man explained. "He's very strong and mean.  Since you came, the Asuras have become even worse. They scare us, throw bad things into our sacred places, and even kill us!"

"They ruin our ceremonies," the holy man continued. "They put out our sacred fires! We're too scared to stay here anymore."

"We're going to Tapovana, a safer place," he said.  "Rama, you should come too.  They might try to hurt you as well!"

Rama tried to convince them to stay, but the holy men were too afraid. He walked with them a little way, said goodbye, and then returned home.  Even though many left, some holy men stayed with Rama, and he took very good care of them.
