Once upon a time, there was a big battle in heaven!  Indra, the king of the gods, wanted to defeat Skanda, the son of Agni (the fire god).  Indra had a huge army with him.  They rode on all sorts of animals and had shiny armor.  They shouted loudly and made a scary noise!

Skanda had his own army, too, with lots of brave soldiers.  They were ready to fight!  

Indra, riding his elephant Airavata, charged towards Skanda.  He threw his powerful thunderbolt!  BOOM! It hit Skanda, but something amazing happened!

From the spot where the thunderbolt hit, a new warrior, Visakha, appeared! He was strong and brave, with a big club.

Indra was so surprised and scared by this that he stopped fighting.  He asked Skanda for forgiveness.  Skanda, being kind, forgave Indra.

The battle ended.  Everyone was happy! The gods celebrated, and the scary sounds were replaced by happy cheers!  The two armies made peace.
