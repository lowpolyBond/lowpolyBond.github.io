Once upon a time, a very powerful god named Mahadeva lived on a beautiful mountain.  This mountain was full of amazing plants, pretty flowers, and lots of fun creatures!  There were friendly ghosts, some with lion faces, some with tiger faces, and even some with elephant faces!  There were also singing birds and dancing peacocks.  It was like a magical party!

Mahadeva was very strong and looked a little scary, with a tiger skin and a lion skin for clothes! He had a snake for a necklace and green hair! He was meditating and doing special exercises to become even more powerful.

Then, his wife, Uma, came to see him.  She was playful and wanted to tease him. She gently covered his eyes with her hands.  

Suddenly, everything went dark! The whole world got scared because Mahadevaâ€™s eyes were closed, and it felt like the sun had disappeared.  To save everyone, Mahadeva grew a third eye right on his forehead! This eye shone like a super bright sun, and it was so powerful that it started to burn the beautiful mountain!

The animals ran to Mahadeva for help. Uma was very sorry she'd covered his eyes. She asked him to stop, and he did!  He used his magic to make the mountain beautiful again.

Uma was curious.  She asked Mahadeva why he looked so different. Why was one side of his face nice and friendly, and the other side scary? Why did he have a third eye? Why did he carry a big bow and arrow?

Mahadeva smiled.  He explained that his different looks showed his different powers.  He also explained that he had made the third eye to save the world from the darkness that fell when Uma covered his eyes. Then he continued with more explanations, about his different aspects, making Uma very happy because she understood so much more about him.  The end!
