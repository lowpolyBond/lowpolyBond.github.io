King Dhritarashtra was worried.  He'd heard about Abhimanyu, Arjuna's son, fighting bravely in the big battle.  He asked Sanjaya, "Is it true? Abhimanyu, all by himself, fought against so many warriors and won?"

Sanjaya said, "It's true, Your Majesty!  It was amazing!  At first,  Dhritarashtra's army was scared. They were sweating and shaking.  They dropped their weapons and ran away!  They left their friends and family behind!"

"But then," Sanjaya continued, "great warriors like Drona, Karna, and Duryodhana got angry. They attacked Abhimanyu.  Almost everyone was pushed back by Abhimanyu, except for one, Lakshmana.  He was young, brave, and very proud.  He fought Abhimanyu."

Duryodhana worried about Lakshmana and rushed to help, followed by many other warriors. They all shot arrows at Abhimanyu, like a big storm!  But Abhimanyu kept fighting!  He was strong, like an angry elephant! He defeated Lakshmana and said, "Prepare to meet your end!"  Then, with one powerful arrow, Abhimanyu cut off Lakshmana's head.

Dhritarashtra's army cried out when Lakshmana died. Duryodhana was furious. He yelled, "Kill Abhimanyu!"  Six strong warriors surrounded Abhimanyuâ€”Drona, Karna, Kripa, and others.  Abhimanyu fought them all off! Then he attacked Jayadratha's army.  More soldiers, on elephants, surrounded him.

Abhimanyu fought bravely against many elephants and soldiers.  Then, Kratha and many other warriors attacked Abhimanyu.  Abhimanyu fought so hard that he defeated Kratha! He cut down Kratha's bow, his arms, even his chariot and horses! After Kratha fell, most of the other warriors ran away.  Abhimanyu was incredibly strong and brave!
