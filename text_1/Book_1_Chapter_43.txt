Once upon a time, a powerful snake named Takshaka challenged a wise Brahmin named Kasyapa.  Takshaka said, "If you're so smart, bring this tree back to life after I bite it!"

Kasyapa agreed. Takshaka bit the tree, and whoosh! The tree turned to ashes!  But Kasyapa wasn't scared. He used his magic and, sprinkle, sprinkle, poof!  He grew a new tree from the ashes! It had a tiny sprout, then leaves, then a trunk, branches, and finally, it was a big, strong tree again!

Takshaka was amazed. He said, "You're amazing! I'll give you anything you want instead of you going to help that king who's cursed." Kasyapa wanted some treasure. Takshaka gave him lots of gold.

But Takshaka still wanted to bite the king.  He tricked the king.  He sent some snakes who looked like holy men. They gave the king some delicious fruit.  Hidden inside one fruit was Takshaka!  When the king ate the fruit, Takshaka jumped out!  The king knew his time was up, so he let Takshaka bite him.  Takshaka bit the king, and the curse came true.
