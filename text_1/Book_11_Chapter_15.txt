After the big battle, Bhima talked to Gandhari, Duryodhana's mother.  Gandhari was very sad because all her sons were dead.

Bhima said, "I know I did bad things, but I was scared for myself and our kingdom. Duryodhana was always unfair to us. He even hurt Draupadi!  He was a powerful warrior, and if I hadn't stopped him, he would have taken our kingdom again. I had to do what I did to protect us."

Gandhari said, "But you killed all my sons! Even if Duryodhana was bad, they didn't deserve to die." She also reminded Bhima about a time he drank Duhshasana's blood â€“ that was very cruel.

Bhima explained, "I only touched the blood, I didn't drink it. And I had to scare the Kauravas after they were mean to us. I had promised to do it, and a warrior always keeps their promise."

Gandhari was still heartbroken. She said, "You killed so many of my sons! You didn't leave even one for me."

Then Yudhishthira, the Pandavas' leader, came. He felt terrible about everything.  He told Gandhari, "I am so sorry. I should be blamed for all this.  Curse me, I deserve it!"

Gandhari looked at Yudhishthira's toe.  Just by looking at him, she caused a sore to appear on his toe.  The Pandavas felt very worried.  But then Gandhari stopped being angry. She comforted them like a mother would.

Kunti, the Pandavas' mother, was also very sad. She hugged her sons and cried.  Draupadi, Yudhishthira's wife, cried too because all her sons were gone.  She asked Gandhari, "Where are all your grandsons?"

Gandhari said, "Don't be so sad, Kunti. This was meant to happen.  It's like time decided this would happen. Nobody wanted this."  She was very sad too.  She said it was her fault that all her family was gone.  Everyone was heartbroken after the terrible war.
