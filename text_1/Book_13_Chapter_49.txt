Once upon a time, in the land of Bharat, wise King Yudhishthira had questions about family and sons.  He asked his grandfather, Bhishma, a very wise and old man, for answers.

Bhishma said, "A child's actions show who they really are, not just who their parents are.  If a child is mean or doesn't follow the rules, it shows.  Just like a tiger cub has stripes like its parents, a child often acts like their mom or dad.  A good person is kind and does good things.  Even if someone tries to hide who they are, their true nature will show."

Yudhishthira then asked about different kinds of sons.  Bhishma explained:

* **Your own son:** A son from your own wife.
* **Niruktaja:** A son your wife has with a man you chose.
* **Prasritaja:** A son your wife has without your permission.
* **Patitaja:** A son your wife has with a man who is not respected.
* **Given son:** A son given to you.
* **Made son:** A son you raise as your own.
* **Adhyudha:** A special kind of son.
* **Kanina:** A son born to a maiden in her father's house.

Then, Bhishma talked about more complicated situations.  He explained about sons from mixed marriages – marriages where people from different groups married. Some of these sons were called "Apadhwansajas" and "Apasadas". He listed many different types, explaining who their parents were and what their status was.

Yudhishthira asked if a son was who he was born *from* or who he was born *to*.  Bhishma said that a son is the child of the person whose seed created him. But if that father leaves the child, the child becomes the son of the man who cares for him and his mother.

Yudhishthira wondered about "made sons" – children who were found and raised by someone else. Bhishma explained that a "made son" belongs to the person who raises him, and follows that person's rules and customs.  The person who raises him decides his place in society.

Finally, Yudhishthira asked about the special ceremonies for each kind of son.  Bhishma said the ceremonies were done according to the customs of the man who raised the child.

Bhishma finished by saying, "A person's actions, not just their birth, show who they truly are."  He told Yudhishthira that even a person born into a low group could be noble if they behaved well.  And someone born into a high group could be looked down upon if they behaved badly.
