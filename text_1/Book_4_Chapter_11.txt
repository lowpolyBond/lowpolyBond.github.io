Once upon a time, a very big and beautiful person arrived at King Virata's palace.  This person was so big, they shook the ground when they walked!  They were wearing fancy jewelry, like sparkly earrings and gold bracelets.  They looked like a giant elephant!

King Virata was surprised.  He'd never seen anyone like this before.  He asked his people, "Who is this?"  Nobody knew.

King Virata said, "You're so strong! You look like someone from the sky!  You're young and have dark skin, like an elephant leader.  You’re wearing beautiful jewelry. You look like a warrior prince! I'm old and tired of ruling. You could be my son, or even rule the kingdom yourself!"  He thought this person was probably a man.

But the big person, who was actually Arjuna in disguise, said, "I can sing, dance, and play music! I’m really good at it.  I want to teach the princess Uttara to dance.  Don't worry about my secret; it's a sad story. Just call me Vrihannala."

King Virata said, "Okay, Vrihannala, you can teach my daughter.  But you deserve to rule a whole kingdom, not just teach dancing!"

The king tested Vrihannala's skills. He checked if Vrihannala could really dance, sing, and play music.  He even had some women check if Vrihannala was a man.  When they found out Vrihannala wasn't a man, the king let Vrihannala teach Princess Uttara and her friends.

Arjuna, as Vrihannala, secretly lived in the palace, teaching the princesses and having fun.  Nobody knew he was the great warrior Arjuna!
