Yudhishthira asked his grandpa Bhishma, "Grandpa, what is Adhyatma?  Where did the whole world – all the animals and plants – come from? And where does everything go when the world ends?"

Bhishma smiled.  "Yudhishthira, Adhyatma is a very good thing to know! It brings happiness.  Wise teachers have explained it for a long time. It shows how the world begins and ends.

Think of the earth, air, water, fire (light!), and space. They're like the building blocks of everything. Everything is made from these five things. And when things break down, they go back to these five things, like waves returning to the ocean.

Imagine a turtle pulling its legs in and out of its shell. The Supreme Soul, the greatest of all, is like that. It makes everything, and then it takes it back.  It mixes the five things in different ways to make everything.  We just don't always see it.

Our senses – hearing, seeing, tasting, smelling, and touching – help us understand the world.  Our mind thinks about what we see and hear. Our understanding helps us figure things out. And then there's our soul, like a silent watcher, seeing everything.  It's inside us, everywhere.

Our minds have three qualities: Goodness (happiness), Passion (sadness), and Darkness (confusion).  These three guide our understanding of the world. When we understand how things begin and end, we become peaceful.

Everything comes from the Intelligence, and everything goes back to it. Our senses are how we experience the world. Our minds think, sometimes happy, sometimes sad. Sometimes our minds are peaceful.  The purest Intelligence is beyond happy and sad; it's just… *is*.  But the Darkness often makes us want things, making our senses go! Goodness makes us happy, Passion makes us sad, and Darkness makes us confused.


Our soul is different from our mind. It watches everything. It’s like a lamp shining through a small hole, seeing everything around it, but not being part of it.  Our mind makes all these feelings, but our soul simply sees.

The best thing is to be peaceful, like a bird on the water, not getting wet.  Live without being too happy or sad, treat everyone the same, and be kind.  Then you create your own qualities instead of them controlling you, like a spider making its web.

Knowing this brings happiness.  Understanding how everything begins and ends helps us let go of our worries. It's like crossing a river – just knowing where you’re going isn’t enough; you need to do it.  Knowing the Truth brings true happiness.

The wisest people understand their soul and realize it’s always been there, unchanging.  They don't fear anything because they understand everything.  The greatest goal is freedom, and acting without wanting anything in return helps us get there.  Bad actions lead to bad consequences; good actions bring peace."
