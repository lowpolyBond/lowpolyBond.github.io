Once upon a time, beautiful Sita was sad and lonely.  She missed her husband, Rama.  She wore simple clothes and just one little jewel.  She sat on a rock and cried.  Some scary Rakshasa women looked after her.

Then, Ravana came. He was a powerful king, very handsome and dressed in fancy clothes. He looked like a beautiful tree, but to Sita, he was scary, like a tree in a graveyard.  He was very much in love with Sita.

Ravana said, "Sita, you love your husband too much!  Be kind to me!  Be my queen! I have many, many servants and treasures!  I'm a very important king!  Leave this sad place and come live with me!"

But Sita said, "No! I am Rama's wife. I will only ever be with him.  You are powerful, but it's wrong to force someone to love you.  Your father was a wise man. Why don't you be good like him?"

Sita cried a lot. Her hair fell down like a long, black snake.

Ravana felt sad that Sita didn’t like him. He said, "Fine. I won't force you.  But Rama is just a man, and you belong to me now.” Then, poof! He disappeared.

Sita stayed there, still sad, but Trijata, one of the kind Rakshasa women, comforted her.
