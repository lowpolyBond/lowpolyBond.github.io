Once upon a time, in a land far away, lived a brave prince named Sanjaya. His mother, Kunti, was a strong warrior.  She told Sanjaya he needed to fight a big battle.

Sanjaya was sad. He said, "Mother, you're being so tough!  You're asking me to fight like I'm a stranger.  What good is the world, or all your jewels, if you don't care about me, your only son?"

Kunti explained, "My dear son, I only want what's best for you.  This battle is important.  If you don't fight, everyone will think poorly of you, and that would make me sad. My love for you isn't like a donkey's love for her baby – it's strong and wise.  Do what is right and brave.  Be a good warrior like you should be. Then I will be proud of you."

Kunti said a Kshatriya, a warrior prince like Sanjaya, was made for battle.  Winning or losing, it brought great honor.  A warrior should always fight, even if they lose many times. It's better to fight than to feel sad and defeated.

Sanjaya said, "Mother, please don't say such harsh things!  Be kind and stay with me."

Kunti said, "I'm happy you spoke to me.  Let's do this.  I'll be proud when you win the battle and defeat all the Saindhavas!"

Sanjaya worried.  "Mother, I have no money or friends to help me fight. I don't want to fight without help!"

Kunti said, "Don't give up hope, my son! Sometimes things seem impossible, but they get done. Don't be angry or foolish. Always try, even if you might not succeed.  People who never try never win. If you try, you might win or lose, but you will always have tried. Those who don't try always lose."

Kunti gave Sanjaya a clever plan. "Make friends with people who hate your enemies.  Find those who are jealous, angry, or weak. Offer them gifts and be kind.  Treat them well, and they will help you.  Be brave, and show your enemies you're not afraid to fight! Even if they are strong, try to be friends with them. If that doesn’t work, fight!"

Sanjaya listened to his wise mother. He followed her advice and won the day!
