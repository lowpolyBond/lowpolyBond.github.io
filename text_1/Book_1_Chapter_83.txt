Once upon a time, there was a king named Yayati. He had two wives: Devayani and Sarmishtha.  Devayani was a princess, and Sarmishtha was a beautiful woman.

Sarmishtha had three sons. Devayani was jealous because she only had two.  She asked Sarmishtha how she had her children. Sarmishtha said a wise man had given her the children.  Devayani believed her and wasn't angry anymore.

One day, Devayani and Yayati were walking in the woods. They saw three handsome boys playing. Devayani asked who they were. The boys said Sarmishtha was their mother, and Yayati was their father.

Devayani was very upset!  She thought Yayati had been unfair. She ran to her father, Sukra, a very wise and powerful man, to tell him everything.  Yayati followed her, feeling very sorry.

Devayani told her father that Yayati had been with Sarmishtha secretly. Sukra was angry. He cursed Yayati!  Yayati suddenly became very, very old.

Yayati was sad. He asked Sukra to remove the curse. Sukra said he couldn't, but Yayati could give his old age to one of his sons.  Whoever gave Yayati his youth would become king.

Yayati felt very sad and old.  His sons had a big choice to make. What would they do?
