Once upon a time, a wise priest from King Drupada's kingdom went to meet the Kaurava king, Dhritarashtra.  He was welcomed by Dhritarashtra, Bhishma, and Vidura.  He first asked how the Kauravas were doing, and then he told them good news about the Pandavas.

He said, "You all know what kings should do â€“ be fair and just.  Dhritarashtra and Pandu were brothers.  They should have shared their father's kingdom equally. But the Kauravas, Dhritarashtra's sons, kept all the kingdom for themselves!  They didn't give anything to the Pandavas, Pandu's sons."

The priest explained how the Kauravas had tried to hurt the Pandavas many times. They even tried to kill them! But the Pandavas survived.  Then, when the Pandavas bravely won their own kingdom, the Kauravas, with the help of Shakuni, cheated them and took it back! Dhritarashtra even let this happen.

The Pandavas were forced to live in the forest for thirteen years!  They faced many hardships, even in the city of Virata. They suffered a lot.  But even after all this, the Pandavas only want peace!  They don't want a war. They just want what is rightfully theirs.

The priest warned, "The Pandavas are very strong.  They have a huge army ready to fight!  Arjuna is a powerful warrior, and Krishna is very wise.  They have many brave fighters like Bhima and Satyaki.  They are much stronger than you!"

He pleaded, "Please, give back what belongs to the Pandavas.  Don't start a war!  It's the right thing to do.  Don't miss this chance for peace!"
