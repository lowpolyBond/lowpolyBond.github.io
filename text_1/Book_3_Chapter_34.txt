King Yudhishthira, the eldest Pandava brother, sighed.  Bhima, his strong brother, was angry.  Yudhishthira had lost a game to the wicked Sakuni.  Sakuni cheated! He tricked Yudhishthira with unfair dice.

"It's all my fault," Yudhishthira said sadly. "I wanted to win back our kingdom from the Kauravas.  I was foolish and proud.  Sakuni was too clever for me."

Yudhishthira explained that the Kauravas, led by the mean Duryodhana, made him play a game. If he lost, the Pandavas had to live in the forest for twelve years, and then hide for a thirteenth year. If anyone found them during the hiding year, they had to start all over again.  

"I promised," Yudhishthira said. "We lost the game. Now we are in hiding. We're sad and miss our home.  Even seeing Draupadi hurt made us feel terrible, but we had made a promise we couldnâ€™t break."

Bhima was still angry. He wanted to fight right then.  He wished he could have stopped Yudhishthira from playing the game in the first place.

Yudhishthira said, "Bhima, I know you are angry, but our promise is sacred.  Even death is better than breaking a promise.  We must wait for our chance to get revenge.  When we are strong again, we will fight back! Truth and honor are more important than anything, even a kingdom."

Yudhishthira told Bhima that someday, their victory would be even sweeter because they waited and were patient.  He knew that being true to his word was the most important thing.
