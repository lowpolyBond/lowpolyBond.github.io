Long ago, a wise teacher named Krishna told Arjuna a very important secret.  He said, "I taught this secret to the sun god, who told Manu, who told Ikshvaku, and so on, down through many kings.  But people forgot it! Now I'm telling you because you're my friend."

Arjuna was confused. "You're younger than the sun god!" he said.

Krishna smiled. "I've lived many lives, Arjuna, just like you.  I'm always reborn when people forget what's right and wrong.  I come back to help good people and stop bad ones. Anyone who truly understands this and lives a good life doesn't have to be reborn again. They come to me."

Krishna explained that he helps everyone, in their own way. People who want success pray to gods.  He created the four different types of people in the world – but remember, he isn't controlling them.  Our actions don't control him.

"Sometimes it's hard to know what's right," said Krishna. "Some actions look bad, but are good.  Other actions seem good but are wrong.  A truly wise person understands this."

Krishna said that the best way to live is to do your work without worrying about what you get in return.  Do your duty, without being greedy or angry. Be happy with what you have, and don't be jealous.

He explained different kinds of worship. Some people give gifts to the gods, some offer prayers, some control their senses.  The best way, Krishna said, is to understand this secret,  and that takes knowledge.  You learn through listening and doing good deeds.

"Even if you’ve done bad things," Krishna said, "knowledge is like a raft that can take you across the river to a better place. It’s like fire burning away bad deeds. There's nothing better than true knowledge!"

Krishna told Arjuna to use knowledge to get rid of his doubts.  "Believe in yourself and in me, and you will find peace," he said.
