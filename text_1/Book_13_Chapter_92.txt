Long ago, after King Nimi did something wrong, wise men performed a special ceremony called a Sraddha to honor their ancestors, the Pitris.  They gave the Pitris lots and lots of food and water.

But oh dear! The Pitris ate so much they got tummy aches!  They were very unhappy.  So, they went to Soma, a powerful god, for help.

Soma said, "Go to the Grandsire, the creator of the world! He can help."

The Pitris and other gods went to the Grandsire on Mount Meru.  They said, "We're too full!  The food from the Sraddha is making us sick!"

The Grandsire said, "Agni, the fire god, can help you."

Agni, the fire god, said, "Let's share the food! If you eat with me, it won't make you sick anymore."

From that day on, people always gave Agni some food first during the Sraddha.  This kept away mean spirits and helped the Pitris feel better.

During the Sraddha, people offered food to their father, grandfather, and great-grandfather first.  They said special words while offering the food.  Only clean people could be there. And people from the same family had to cook the food.

When crossing a river, people offered water to their ancestors, remembering their names.  They did this even if they were in a cart pulled by oxen or a boat.  They also remembered their friends and relatives who had passed away.

Every two weeks, on the New Moon, people made offerings to their ancestors.  Being good to their ancestors brought good things like health, long life, and happiness!  Many great wise people were considered ancestors too, like Brahman and Kasyapa.

So, by doing the Sraddha properly, people helped their ancestors to be happy and peaceful.  That's the story of the Sraddha, king! Now, let's talk about gifts.
