Once upon a time, a naughty man named Yavakri wandered near a beautiful hermitage.  He saw Raivya's daughter-in-law, and he liked her very much.  He asked her to be with him.

She was scared!  She knew Yavakri was trouble.  She also knew Raivya, her father-in-law, was very powerful.  So, she tricked Yavakri. She pretended to agree, but secretly she tied him up!

When Raivya came home, his daughter-in-law was crying.  He asked what was wrong. She told him about Yavakri. Raivya was very, very angry!

He was so angry, he pulled out some of his long hair and threw it into a fire!  Suddenly, a woman who looked just like his daughter-in-law appeared!  Then, he pulled out more hair and threw it into the fire.  This time, a scary demon appeared!

Raivya told them, "Go and punish Yavakri!"

The woman used her magic to take away Yavakri's special water pot. This made him unclean.  The demon chased him with a sharp spear!

Yavakri ran and ran! He tried to hide, but couldn't find any water.  He tried to hide in his father's house, but a guard stopped him.  Then, the demon threw his spear, and Yavakri fell down, dead.

The demon and the woman went back to Raivya. He let them live at the hermitage.  And that's the story of how a naughty man was punished for being mean!
