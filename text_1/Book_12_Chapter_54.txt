After the big battle, the great warrior Bhishma lay wounded on a bed of arrows.  Many important people were there, like the Pandava brothers, Krishna, and even wise men called Rishis.  Everyone was sad.

A very wise Rishi named Narada spoke up.  He said, "Bhishma is very wise and knows so much about what's right and wrong.  He's going to die soon, like the sun setting.  Before he goes, you should ask him all your questions!"

But the Pandavas, the sons of Pandu, felt shy. Yudhishthira, the oldest Pandava, said, "Krishna, you're the wisest.  You should ask Bhishma the questions."

Krishna, a very kind and powerful man, went to Bhishma. He asked kindly, "Bhishma, are you feeling better? Is your mind clear?"

Bhishma smiled. "Krishna, thanks to you, all my pain is gone! I can see everything clearly â€“ the past, the present, and the future! I remember everything I learned about being good and doing what's right."

Bhishma explained that he knew all the rules from the holy books, the Vedas. He understood how everyone should live, from kings to common people. He knew all the rules for being a good king and a good person.

Then Krishna said, "Bhishma, you are famous! Everyone respects you.  What you say will be as important as the Vedas themselves. Please tell the Pandavas and everyone else what you know.  Share your wisdom, so your good name will live on forever. It's your duty.  The people need to hear your advice."

Bhishma agreed. He was ready to share all his knowledge with everyone before he died, so that they could all learn to be good and live happy lives.
