Once upon a time, the gods were scared of some very bad giants called Danavas.  They were super strong!  They prayed to the great god Shiva, who is also called Mahadeva.

Shiva said, "I'll help, but I can't do it alone.  You gods need to fight too!"

The gods worried. "The Danavas are twice as strong as us!" they said.

But Shiva said, "I'll use half my power, and you use half your combined power. Together, we're strong enough!"

The gods agreed.  They helped Shiva build an amazing chariot!  It was HUGE!  They used parts from all over the world: the Earth was the chariot's floor, mountains were its wheels, rivers were its ropes, and stars were its decorations!  Even the gods themselves gave parts of their power to make it super strong.

Vishnu, Agni (the god of fire), and Soma (the moon god) became the arrow.  It was a powerful weapon!

Then Shiva needed a driver.  The gods asked Brahma, the creator god, to drive. Brahma said, "Yes, I will!"

Brahma drove the chariot, and Shiva, with his mighty bow and arrow, fought the Danavas.  The arrow was so powerful, it destroyed the Danavas' three cities in one shot!

Shiva won the battle! The gods were very happy. They thanked Shiva and Brahma.

Duryodhana, a king from another story, told another story about a brave man named Rama. Rama was a good man who wanted to help the gods too.  He prayed to Shiva for powerful weapons.  Shiva was happy with Rama's devotion and gave him amazing weapons.

Rama fought the Danavas, but he got hurt. Shiva healed him and gave him even more powerful weapons.  Rama was so strong that he learned how to make super strong weapons himself! He taught them to Karna, a great warrior.

Duryodhana believed Karna was extra special, maybe even a god in disguise, because he was so strong and brave. That's why Karna had such powerful weapons.
