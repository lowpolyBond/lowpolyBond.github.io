Long ago, a wise king named Yudhishthira asked a very old and wise man, Bhishma, about women.  Yudhishthira thought women caused a lot of trouble.

Bhishma told a story. He said that a wise man named Narada met a beautiful woman named Panchachuda. Narada wanted to know what women were really like.

Panchachuda said, "I'm a woman, so I can't say bad things about women." But Narada said it was okay to tell the truth.

Panchachuda agreed. She said that even if women are rich and have good families, they sometimes still break the rules. She said women are never satisfied.  They always want more.

Panchachuda explained that women might be loyal to their husbands because they're scared of getting in trouble, or because they fear their family, not necessarily because they truly love their husbands.  Sometimes, a woman might even like a man who's not very handsome or even kind!  They love attention, and they're always looking for someone new.

Panchachuda said that women are like a fire that never stops burning, or the ocean that's always thirsty for more water.  She said women are full of strong feelings, just like wind, fire, or a dangerous snake.

Panchachuda said that's just how women were created.  It's part of their nature.  She didn't say women were bad, but she said that it's important to understand how they think and feel.
