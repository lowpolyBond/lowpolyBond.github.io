Once upon a time, a magical snake-person, a Naga, lived in a beautiful palace.  A wise woman, the Naga's wife, found a kind-looking man, a Brahmin, waiting outside.

The Naga was grumpy! "Who is this man?" he hissed. "Only special people, gods or powerful beings, can even see us Nagas!  This man...he's just a human!"

His wife gently explained, "He's not a god, dear. He's just a very humble man who really needs your help. He's waiting patiently, just like a little bird waits for rain."

The Naga was still upset.  "But Nagas are powerful! We shouldn't be seen by anyone!" he grumbled.

His wise wife reminded him, "Being angry is bad. It can cause big trouble.  Remember Ravana, the ten-headed king? He was angry and got into a big fight and lost!  Even strong kings have been defeated because of anger.  Being kind and helpful is much better."

The Naga listened.  He thought about what his wife said.  "You are right," he said. "Anger is a bad thing.  I'm sorry I was grumpy.  You are so wise and kind!  I will go see the Brahmin and help him."

So, the Naga went to meet the Brahmin. The Brahmin was very happy to see him, and the Naga helped him with whatever he needed.  The Brahmin went home happily, and the Naga learned a valuable lesson about being kind and not letting anger rule him.
