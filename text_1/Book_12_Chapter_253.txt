Once upon a time, a wise old man named Vyasa told a story.  He said that our souls are very, very small and hidden inside our bodies.  It's like tiny sunlight, too small to see, but we know it's there.

Just like we can't see all the sunlight in the sky, we can't see other souls.  But special people, called Yogis, can. They're like detectives who can find the hidden soul inside a body. It's like seeing a sun's reflection in water – they see the soul's reflection.

These Yogis are very good at calming their minds. They can see souls even when they're sleeping!  They practice special exercises to keep their minds calm and clear.  Their souls are happy and free from sickness and death.  But Vyasa says this freedom is like a story – even yogis' souls aren't completely free forever.

Other people, who don't practice these special exercises, only see their own bodies in their dreams.  They feel happy or sad, angry or greedy, just like they do when they are awake.  In their dreams, they might even get rich or do good things!

It's amazing, isn't it?  Our souls are so tiny, and yet, they live inside us for a long time.  Only those who work hard to calm their minds can see the true soul that's part of something much, much bigger, like a tiny part of the bright sun.  They can see this special soul even when things are destroyed.

To understand all this, Vyasa said, we need to learn about many things.  We need to learn about our senses, our mind, and the power that makes the world go round.  We need to learn about something even bigger than the world, something all-knowing and powerful, and finally we can understand that everything is part of something much, much bigger than us.  By learning all this, people can see the great and powerful Brahma.
