Rama, a very good and honest king, had to go live in the forest.  His wife, Sita, wanted to go with him.  But Rama said, "No, Sita! The forest is a scary place!"

He explained, "It's called 'Antara,' which means it's not a good place for people.  There are scary lions and dangerous rivers.  You might get lost!  There are mean elephants and crocodiles.  It's hard to find food or water. You'd have to sleep on the ground, eat only berries, and pray all the time! It's full of thorny bushes, stinging insects, and poisonous snakes!"

Rama told Sita about the harsh weather and how hard life in the forest would be.  He didn't want her to suffer.  He loved her very much and wanted her to be safe.  He pleaded with her to stay behind, saying the forest was too dangerous for her.

Sita was very sad. She really wanted to be with Rama, no matter what.  But Rama kept trying to convince her to stay, worried about all the dangers.
