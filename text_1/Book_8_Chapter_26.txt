Once upon a time, in a great battle, a brave warrior named Kripa fought Dhrishtadyumna. Kripa was strong, like a big scary forest animal fighting a proud lion!  He was so strong that Dhrishtadyumna couldn't even move.

Everyone watching was scared.  The soldiers whispered, "Kripa is so angry because his friend Drona died! Will Dhrishtadyumna survive? Will we all be safe?"  Kripa was a powerful warrior, and he attacked Dhrishtadyumna fiercely.

Dhrishtadyumna was stunned.  His chariot driver said, "This is terrible! Kripa's arrows are so sharp, they almost hit you! We need to go!"  Dhrishtadyumna, scared and sweaty, agreed. "Take me to Arjuna or Bhima!  They can help!"

His driver quickly drove away. Kripa chased them, shooting many arrows! He was like a powerful god defeating a demon.

In another part of the battle, Shikhandi, a brave warrior, fought Kritavarma.  They fought bravely! Shikhandi shot five arrows, but Kritavarma shot back sixty!  He even broke Shikhandi's bow!

Shikhandi got a new bow and shot ninety arrows. But Kritavarma's armor was strong; the arrows bounced off.  Shikhandi then broke Kritavarma's bow and shot eighty arrows, hitting Kritavarma all over. Kritavarma was hurt and bleeding, but he looked strong and brave.

He shot back at Shikhandi. Both warriors were hurt and bleeding, circling each other many times. Then Kritavarma shot a powerful arrow at Shikhandi and he fell! Shikhandi's driver rushed him away from the battle.

After Shikhandi was defeated, the Pandavas' army was losing badly and had to run away.  It was a sad day for the Pandavas.
