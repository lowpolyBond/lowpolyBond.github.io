Once upon a time, a wise king named Yudhishthira asked his grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandpa, how can we tell who's truly kind on the inside and who's just pretending?"

Bhishma smiled. "I'll tell you a story," he said. "Long ago, in a rich city, a very mean king was reborn as a jackal.  Even though he was a jackal, he was kind and honest. He ate only fruit and lived in a scary place called a crematorium!"

The other jackals were surprised. "Why are you so good?" they asked. "You should eat meat like us!"

But the jackal said, "It's not where you live, but how you act that matters. I want to be known for being good."

A strong tiger overheard this. He thought the jackal was wise and asked him to be his advisor.  "I'm a fierce tiger," the tiger warned, "but if you're kind, you'll do well."

The jackal agreed, but only on his terms.  "I'll only talk to you secretly," he said, "because the other advisors might be jealous."

The tiger's old advisors were angry. They were greedy and mean. They didn't want the kind jackal to help the tiger.  So they tricked the tiger. They stole the tiger's dinner and blamed it on the jackal!

The angry tiger almost killed the jackal! But the tiger's wise mother stopped him. "Don't believe them!" she said.  "Good people can be tricked, and bad people can pretend to be good. You need to think carefully."

A loyal friend of the jackal proved he was innocent. The tiger was very sorry.  He hugged the jackal.

But the jackal was too hurt. He had been treated unfairly. He decided to leave, not by running away but by doing a special practice that would lead him to a better place.  He said, "Being treated badly hurts even a kind heart.  I can't trust you anymore."  Then, the jackal went to a peaceful place, proving that even the best actions sometimes get misunderstood.  

Bhishma finished the story.  "So, Yudhishthira," he said, "it's hard to know people's hearts. But always be kind, and always be true to yourself."
