Sanjaya told the king, "When Karna, the brave warrior, fell, the Kaurava army was terrified!  They all ran away in different directions, their eyes wide with fear.  Everyone was scared because their strongest fighter was gone.

The Kaurava leaders were worried.  They wanted to get their soldiers back to camp, but Duryodhana's son tried to stop them from running.  He finally let them go, following the advice of Shalya.

Many Kaurava groups headed back.  Kritavarma, with some of his soldiers, hurried to the camp. Shakuni, surrounded by a thousand magical soldiers called Gandharvas, also ran back. Kripa, with his big elephants, quickly followed. Even Ashvatthama, though brave, was shocked by the Pandavas' victory and went back to camp. Susharma and his remaining soldiers also ran, looking scared.

Poor Duryodhana, feeling sad and defeated, walked slowly toward the camp. Shalya, a great warrior, went back too; his chariot was even missing its flag!  Many other brave Kaurava soldiers ran away, scared and ashamed.

After Karna's death, no one wanted to fight anymore. The Kauravas felt hopeless. They thought they had lost everything â€“ their kingdom, their families, and even their lives!

Duryodhana's son was very sad.  He gently helped the remaining Kaurava warriors go back to camp to rest for the night. They walked away with sad hearts and pale faces."
