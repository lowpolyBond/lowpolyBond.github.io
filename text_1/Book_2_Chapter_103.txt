Once upon a time, Queen Kaushalya and the other queens were very sad.  Their husband, King Dasaratha, had died.  They went to visit Rama, their son, who lived in the forest.

They walked along the river Mandakini.  They saw Rama, his brother Lakshmana, and his wife Sita. Rama was kind and helpful; Lakshmana fetched water for everyone.  Queen Kaushalya cried.  "Look!" she said. "My Rama is doing the work of a servant!  He's making a small cake for his father’s memory."  She felt very sad.  It wasn't a fancy cake, just a simple one, and she thought it wasn't good enough for a great king like Dasaratha.

The queens reached Rama’s home in the forest. They were so sad to see Rama living simply, away from his palace.  They cried.  Rama stood up and touched his mothers' feet. Lakshmana and Sita bowed too. They all showed respect and love.

Queen Kaushalya hugged Sita.  "Oh, Sita," she said, "you look so thin and tired! The sun has made your skin dark. I’m so heartbroken to see you like this."

Then, a wise man named Vasishtha came. Rama touched his feet to show respect.

Soon, Bharata arrived with many important people from the kingdom.  Bharata sat down near Rama, looking very respectful.  Bharata looked like a son sitting near his father. Everyone wondered what Bharata would say to Rama. Rama, Lakshmana and Bharata looked like three holy fires, burning brightly with love and goodness.
