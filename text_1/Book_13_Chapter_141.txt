Once upon a time, a very beautiful woman named Tilottama was created.  She was so beautiful that when she went to see Lord Shiva, he wanted to look at her from every direction!  To do this, he magically grew three more faces, making him four-faced!  His east-facing face ruled the world. His north-facing face played with his wife, Parvati (Uma). His west-facing face brought happiness. And his south-facing face was fierce and could destroy things.  He wore matted hair and carried a big bow, the Pinaka, to help the gods.  A long time ago, the powerful god Indra threw lightning at Shiva. It made Shiva’s throat blue, that’s why he is called “blue-throated.”


Parvati asked Shiva why he rode a bull.  Shiva said, a long time ago, a magical cow gave so much milk, that some spilled on him. He got angry and the other cows changed color.  Then, the great god Brahma gave him the bull to ride and put on his flag.

Parvati wondered why Shiva lived in a cremation ground—a scary place with bones, fire, and jackals!  Shiva said, it’s the holiest place he knows! He loves the peaceful ghosts who live there.

Parvati then asked about the duties of different people. Shiva explained:

Householders should be kind, tell the truth, be gentle, calm, and share what they have.  They shouldn't take things that aren't theirs, or eat honey and meat.

Brahmins (priests) should study holy books, be pure, and help others.  They should fast and worship gods.

Warriors (Kshatriyas) should protect everyone, be brave and fair, and fight for what’s right.

Farmers and traders (Vaishyas) should be honest, kind, and share their food.

Servants (Shudras) should serve the others with kindness and truthfulness.

Parvati still had questions.  Shiva said there are three important ways to live:

1. **The householder's way:** Be kind, share, work hard, and worship.
2. **The way of liberation:**  Let go of everything, live simply, and be one with the universe. These people travel and don't stay in one place long.
3. **The way of the sages:**  These holy people live a very simple life, focusing on prayer and meditation.  Some live on just a little bit of food and air.

Parvati asked about the special duties of the sages.  Shiva told her about different kinds of sages, some tiny, some living on the sun, and others living on special drinks.  They all live simply, pray, and help others.  He emphasized that everyone, no matter their life, should be kind, truthful, and calm.
