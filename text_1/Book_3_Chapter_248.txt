King Duryodhana was very sad. He had lost a big battle.  His friend Karna came to him.

"King," Karna said, "you're acting like a baby!  The Pandavas saved you from your enemies.  That's good! Soldiers in your kingdom should always help you, whether you know them or not. Even strong warriors sometimes lose battles and need help from their friends.  The Pandavas live in your kingdom, so they helped you. That's what they should do."

Karna continued, "It's true the Pandavas didn't fight *with* you in the battle. That wasn't very nice.  They were your prisoners before, so they should have fought for you.  But they are still alive! You have all their land and riches!  Don't be so sad! Get up!  People in your kingdom should always do what you want. There's nothing to be upset about!"

Karna said, "If you don't listen to me, I'll stay here and serve you forever.  I don't want to leave you. Don't starve yourself! Other kings will laugh at you!"

But Duryodhana was too upset. He wouldn't get up. He still wanted to die.
