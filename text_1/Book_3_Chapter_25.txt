Once upon a time, the Pandava brothers lost everything.  They were very sad.  But they found a nice forest home by the Saraswati River, full of Sala trees.  They were like kings playing in the woods!

Their wise king, Yudhishthira, was kind to everyone. He gave good food to the holy men who lived there.  Their priest, Dhaumya, helped them with their prayers.

One day, a very old and wise holy man, Markandeya, came to visit.  He smiled when he saw the Pandavas.  Yudhishthira was confused.  "Everyone else is sad," he said, "Why are you smiling?"

Markandeya said, "I'm not happy! I'm remembering Rama.  He was a great king, like you, but he had to live in the forest, too, because his father asked him to.  Rama was very strong and brave, but he obeyed."

Markandeya explained, "Being strong doesn't mean doing wrong.  Many great kings were humble. They followed the rules, even when it was hard.  Look at the elephants – even they follow the rules of nature!  Look at all the animals – they all live by the rules!"

He told Yudhishthira, "You are a good and strong king.  Even though you're in the forest now, you will get back everything you lost. You will be a great king again!"

After talking to Yudhishthira and his brothers and their priest, the wise old man went away. He walked towards the north.
