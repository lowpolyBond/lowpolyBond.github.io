Once upon a time, after a big, scary war, Yudhishthira, the brave prince, felt much better. He sat on a shiny golden throne, facing east.  His friends, Satyaki and Krishna, sat on golden thrones facing him.  Strong Bhima and brave Arjuna sat beside him on jeweled thrones.  His mother, Kunti, sat on a beautiful white ivory throne with his younger brothers, Nakula and Sahadeva.  King Dhritarashtra, Vidura, and many others also had special seats.

Everyone was so happy!  They brought Yudhishthira beautiful white flowers, gold, silver, and precious jewels.  People came with all sorts of gifts for the coronation.  There were golden jars filled with water, and others made of copper and silver. There were flowers, rice, special grass, cow's milk, and wood for a special fire.  There was honey and butter, and even special ladles.

The wise priest, Dhaumya, helped by Krishna, built a special altar.  Then, Yudhishthira and Draupadi (Krishna's daughter!) sat on a magnificent throne.  Dhaumya poured special butter into the fire and chanted prayers.  Then, King Dhritarashtra and others poured water from a special shell onto Yudhishthiraâ€™s head.  

Drums and horns sounded! Yudhishthira looked so handsome!  He happily accepted gifts from everyone. He gave lots of presents back, especially to wise priests who had studied the holy books.  The priests blessed Yudhishthira, praising him for his bravery and good luck. They were happy that he, his brothers, and his friends had won the war and were safe.  They told him to start ruling his kingdom.

And so, Yudhishthira, the just king, sat on his throne and ruled his big, happy kingdom!
