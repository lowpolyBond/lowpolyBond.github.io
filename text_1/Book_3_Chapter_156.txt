Once upon a time, the Pandava brothers – Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva – lived happily in the mountains with their wife, Draupadi.  They waited for Arjuna to come home.  A sneaky Rakshasa (a kind of demon) pretended to be a nice Brahmin (a holy man). He tricked everyone!

While Bhima went hunting, the Rakshasa, whose name was Jatasura, grabbed Yudhishthira, Nakula, Sahadeva, and Draupadi. He also took all their cool weapons!  Clever Sahadeva quickly grabbed a sword and shouted for Bhima.

Yudhishthira bravely talked to Jatasura.  He explained how important it was to be kind and good.  He said even Rakshasas should be good! He reminded Jatasura that everyone depends on each other. Jatasura, taking all their weapons, needed people to live, too! Yudhishthira even made himself heavy so Jatasura couldn't run away easily.

Sahadeva, a brave warrior, was ready to fight Jatasura. He said, "It's better to die fighting than to be captured!"

Just then, Bhima arrived! He was furious to see his brothers and Draupadi in danger.  He was angry but said, "I didn't kill you before because you were disguised as a Brahmin and our guest.  But now, your time is up!"

Jatasura, scared, tried to fight Bhima.  It was a HUGE fight! They wrestled, threw trees, and even threw rocks at each other.  It was like a super-strong superhero battle!  Bhima, super strong, finally defeated the evil Jatasura.  He hit Jatasura so hard that the Rakshasa's head flew off!

Bhima saved everyone! The Brahmins were very happy and praised Bhima for his bravery.  Everyone was safe again, thanks to Bhima's strength and bravery!
