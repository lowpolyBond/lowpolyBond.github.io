Once upon a time, there was a holy man named Matanga.  He wanted very badly to become a Brahmin, which is like a super-special priest.  Indra, the king of the gods, told him to do really hard yoga.

Matanga stood on one leg for a whole thousand years! He meditated the whole time.  After a thousand years, Indra came back. Matanga was sad.  He asked, "Why can't I be a Brahmin?"

Indra said, "You were born a Chandala. That means you can't be a Brahmin."  He was very kind but firm. He said, "You've worked so hard, ask for a different wish!"

Matanga was so upset! He went to a special place called Prayaga and stood on his toes for one hundred more years! He got so skinny and weak! He almost fell down from exhaustion!  Indra saw him and caught him.

Indra said, "Being a Brahmin isn't for everyone, Matanga.  It's very, very special.  Brahmins are helpers and protectors.  People worship them, and the gods are happy when Brahmins are respected."

Matanga explained how sad he was. He said, "Even Brahmins sometimes do bad things! Why can't I be a Brahmin even though I'm good?"

Indra said, "It's very hard to become a Brahmin, and even harder to stay one. It's only possible through birth. Ask for a different boon."

Matanga thought and said, "Let me be able to change into anything I want! Let me fly in the sky and have anything I desire! Let everyone, even kings and priests, worship me!"

Indra smiled and said, "You will be famous! Everyone will know your name!  You'll be worshipped by many women!"

And so it was! Matanga became very famous. He died happily and went to a wonderful place.

Bhishma finished the story, saying, "See how special being a Brahmin is! It can't be earned, only born into."
