Once upon a time, a king named Nahusha ruled the gods!  He was a good king at first. He did everything right. He gave gifts to the gods, just like we give gifts to our friends. He lit lamps and offered yummy food, sharing it with everyone.  He was very happy.

But then, Nahusha got a bit bossy. He stopped being kind.  He even made a wise man named Agastya pull his chariot!  This wise man was very strong, but Nahusha was being mean.  Hidden in Agastya's hair was another wise man, Bhrigu.

Bhrigu was angry that Nahusha was so unkind.  Nahusha even kicked Agastya!  Bhrigu was so mad, he shouted, "Because you were so mean, you will turn into a snake and fall to Earth!"  POOF! Nahusha turned into a snake.

Nahusha was sad, but he remembered all the good things he’d done. He asked Bhrigu to forgive him.  Agastya, the wise man he’d been unkind to, also helped him.  Bhrigu was finally sorry for Nahusha and said, “A great king named Yudhishthira will help you.”

A long time later, you, Yudhishthira, helped Nahusha!  Nahusha went back to the gods.  The other gods were happy to have their king, Indra, back.  Indra had been in charge while Nahusha was gone.

That's why it's important to be kind and give gifts, especially little lights!  If you give lights, you'll shine bright, just like the moon!  And remember, being kind is always better than being mean.
