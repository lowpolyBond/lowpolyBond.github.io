After a big battle, everyone was sad. But then, a wise saint helped everyone to forgive each other.  The Pandavas and Kauravas, even Karna, met again!  It was like a big family reunion. Brothers hugged brothers, sons hugged fathers, and wives hugged husbands.  Everyone was so happy! They felt like they were in heaven.  There was no anger, no fear, just joy.

They all spent the night together, laughing and talking. Then, the saint made everyone disappear!  Whoosh! They went to different magical places – some went to live with the gods, some with other magical beings.

The saint then spoke to the women whose husbands had died. He said, "If you want to be with your husbands again, jump into the river."  The women trusted him. They asked their father-in-law for permission, and then jumped into the river.  Poof! They became beautiful and joined their husbands in heaven!

Everyone was happy about this amazing reunion.  The saint even made everyone’s wishes come true!  The story says that if you listen to this story, good things will happen to you, too. You'll be happy and have many friends.  It’s a magical story, and listening to it makes you a good person.
