Once upon a time, there was a very strong and handsome king named Sasavindu.  He had 100,000 wives!  Each wife had 1,000 sons, and every single son was a brave warrior.

These princes were amazing! They were super good at archery and wore shiny golden armor. They did many, many important ceremonies called sacrifices, giving away lots of gifts.  When they did their special Horse-sacrifice, they gave away everything!

Imagine this: behind each prince marched hundreds of chariots (like fancy cars!), elephants, and beautiful women wearing golden jewelry. Each woman had 100 elephants, each elephant had 100 chariots, and each chariot had 100 horses all decorated with golden flowers!  Each horse had 1,000 cows, and each cow had 50 goats!  King Sasavindu gave all this away!

He even used golden sticks for his sacrifice, double the number used in other sacrifices.  He had giant mountains of food, so much that even after the huge party, thirteen mountains of food were left over! Everyone in his kingdom was happy and well-fed.

After a long, long time, King Sasavindu died and went to heaven.  He was a really good king,  very different from someone who doesn't give anything away.  So don't be sad, because he lived a wonderful life!
