Once upon a time, the mighty warrior Karna, a super strong archer, went to war!  He attacked King Drupada's beautiful city. After a big battle, Karna won! King Drupada had to give Karna lots of gold, silver, and jewels.  He even had to pay taxes!

Karna didn't stop there. He went north, fought and beat many kings, even a powerful king named Bhagadatta! He climbed a huge mountain, the Himavat, fighting all the way! He conquered all the kings who lived on that mountain, too!

Then Karna went east. He won battles against many kingdoms – the Angas, the Bangas, the Kalingas, and many more! He also fought and won in the south, even against a strong warrior named Rukmi.  Rukmi was so impressed by Karna’s strength that he gave him lots of gold!

Karna also conquered kingdoms in the south and west. He fought many battles and won!  He beat kings all across the land! He even made kings from faraway lands pay him taxes. He was so strong, he conquered the whole world!

After his amazing victories, Karna went back home.  King Dhritarashtra, Karna’s father and brothers were very proud.  Dhritarashtra even said, "Karna, you're the strongest!  You're better than Bhishma, Drona, Kripa, and Vahlika all put together!"

Everyone in the city talked about Karna’s amazing wins. Some people cheered, some were sad, and some were quiet.  Karna, rich and famous, visited his father.  Dhritarashtra and his wife, Gandhari, were overjoyed to see him.

After that, King Duryodhana and his sneaky uncle Shakuni thought Karna’s victories meant the Pandavas (Karna’s cousins) were already defeated and would lose their upcoming battle!  They thought Karna was unbeatable!
