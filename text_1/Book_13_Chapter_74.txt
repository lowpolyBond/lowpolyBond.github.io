Once upon a time, the powerful god Indra asked a wise old man, "What happens to someone who steals or sells a cow?"

The wise old man answered, "It's very bad!  If someone steals a cow to eat it, sell it, or even give it away, they will suffer. They'll go to a place called hell for a very, very long time – as long as there are hairs on the cow's body! This is also true for anyone who lets someone else kill a cow.  It's like blocking a special prayer, a really bad thing to do."

He continued, "If someone steals a cow and then gives it away as a gift, they'll go to heaven for the good deed, but they'll still go to hell for the bad deed of stealing.  Giving gold with the cow makes the gift even better!  It cleanses the giver and helps their family for many generations. It's the best gift you can give!"

The wise old man told Indra all this.  Indra then told King Dasaratha, who told his son Rama. Rama told his brother Lakshmana, who told wise people, and then the story passed down through many generations.

Bhishma, a very wise and old man, learned this story from his teacher and shared it with Yudhishthira. Bhishma said that anyone who shares this story helps themselves and others.  If someone tells this story often, they'll go to a wonderful place in heaven and live happily with the gods forever!  That’s what the Great God said.
