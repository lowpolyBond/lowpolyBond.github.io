Arjuna, a mighty warrior, was very angry.  He wanted to kill Jayadratha, a bad guy.  He told Krishna, his friend and charioteer, "I can defeat six of the enemy's strongest warriors all by myself!  They're no match for me! I will kill Jayadratha right in front of everyone, even Drona, their leader!

"Even if all the gods and creatures in the world protected Jayadratha, I would still kill him! I swear it!  I'll fight my way through Drona's army to get to him. Suyodhana, the enemy king, thinks Drona is their strongest warrior, but I'll show him I'm stronger!

"My arrows will fly like lightning, cutting down soldiers, elephants, and horses! I have powerful weapons from the gods, and I'll use them to defeat everyone who tries to help Jayadratha.  The battlefield will be covered with fallen enemies! I will win this battle, and Jayadratha will be dead by tomorrow!"

Arjuna was very confident. He said his bow, Gandiva, was magical, and with Krishna driving his chariot, he could defeat anyone.  He begged Krishna to get his chariot ready for battle.  "This is a very important battle, Krishna," Arjuna said, "and I must be ready at dawn!"
