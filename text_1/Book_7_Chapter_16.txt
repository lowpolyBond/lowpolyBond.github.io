Once upon a time, in a great battle, the Kaurava army was losing badly.  A brave warrior named Vrishasena fought all by himself! He shot so many arrows, they flew everywhere like the sun's rays in summer.  Many soldiers and elephants fell down, just like trees in a strong wind.

The Pandavas saw Vrishasena and surrounded him. Satanika, Nakula's son, shot ten arrows and hurt him. Then, Karna's son's bow broke, and he was hidden by more arrows!  More Kaurava warriors rushed to help, and soon the Pandavas and Kauravas were fighting fiercely, like gods and giants!  It was a huge, noisy battle with Bhima, Karna, Drona, and many others fighting bravely.

The Pandavas started winning.  They were shouting loudly, and the Kaurava army was losing. Drona, a wise teacher, told his soldiers, "Don't run away!" He fought bravely, charging into the Pandava army.  Yudhishthira fought Drona, but Drona broke his bow!

Then, Kumara, a brave prince, fought Drona. They fought hard! Kumara shot many arrows, but Drona also fought strongly and killed Kumara.  Drona then fought many more Pandava warriors, hurting them with his arrows. He even tried to capture Yudhishthira!  But another warrior, Yugandhara, stopped him. Drona killed Yugandhara, but many other warriors rushed to help Yudhishthira. Vyaghradatta and Singhasena fought bravely against Drona, but Drona was very strong. He killed them both! He was about to capture Yudhishthira whenâ€¦

Arjuna arrived! His chariot made a loud noise, and he fought so fiercely that the battlefield was covered in blood and arrows. It was so dark from all the arrows, nobody could see. Even the sun went down, hidden behind a cloud of dust.  The fighting stopped.  Everyone was tired.

Arjuna had won the battle! He returned to his camp, happy and proud. He looked as bright as the moon in the night sky, sitting in his beautiful chariot. And that's how Arjuna saved Yudhishthira!
