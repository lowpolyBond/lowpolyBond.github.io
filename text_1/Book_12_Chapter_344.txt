Once upon a time, after a storyteller named Sauti finished telling a wonderful story about Narayana (a powerful god), everyone was amazed.  They said hearing stories about Narayana was even better than visiting holy places!

Then, King Janamejaya, who was doing a special snake sacrifice, asked his wise grandfather, Vyasa, another question.  He wanted to know what happened after Narada, a holy man, visited a magical White Island and met Narayana.

Vyasa said, "Let me tell you."  Narada had seen Narayana, but then he hurried to the Vadari mountains. There, he found Nara and Narayana, two other holy men, doing very hard prayers.

Narada was very happy to see them.  Nara and Narayana looked just like Narayana, only they were still alive and living on earth! Narada asked them lots of questions. He told them all about his amazing trip to White Island.

Narada explained that everyone on White Island was very good, and they all loved Narayana. He said Narayana is everywhere, and he is the reason for everything. He even told them how Narayana helps everyone and loves those who are kind.

He said Narayana had told him that He would come to Earth again and again to help people.  He had also shown Narada that He was doing very important prayers, too, so very, very powerful in fact!

Narada was so impressed by Narayana's power and kindness. He decided to stay with Nara and Narayana to learn more from them about their powerful and good God.  And thatâ€™s the story!
