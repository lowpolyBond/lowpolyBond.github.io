Once upon a time, long, long ago, there was a very holy man named Tandi.  He was so good and kind, he spent ten thousand years praying to a great god!  He prayed so hard and focused his mind so deeply, he could finally see the god!

Tandi was amazed! He praised the god with beautiful words. He said things like, "You are the greatest of all! You created everything, and you are everything! You are before time itself, and you will always be!"  He talked about how amazing and powerful the god was.

The god was very happy with Tandi's prayers.  Tandi saw the god as a huge, bright light – a being that was everywhere at once, and was beyond understanding.  

Then Tandi said to the god, "You are the most holy! You are stronger than anything!  You give everyone blessings! You are the absolute truth!" He went on and on, praising the god for being everything good and powerful in the world – even the sun and the rain! He said, "Even the greatest gods can't fully understand you!"

The god was pleased.  He told Tandi, "You will be strong and live forever!  Everyone will know your name!  You'll be wise and full of energy.  Other holy people will come to learn from you." He asked Tandi what he wished for, and Tandi simply asked for his devotion to the god to always be strong.

The god disappeared, and Tandi, so happy and amazed, told another holy man named Upamanyu everything that happened. Upamanyu then told a king the whole wonderful story, and all about how Tandi had learned a thousand special names for the great god, names so sacred, not everyone knows them!  And that's how the story was passed down.
