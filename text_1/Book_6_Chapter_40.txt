Long ago, a wise teacher told a brave warrior named Arjuna about two kinds of people.  There were the good guys and the bad guys!

The good guys were brave, kind, and always tried to learn. They were honest and peaceful. They helped others and didn't get angry easily.  They were humble and didn't brag.  They cared about everyone and everything.  They were like shining stars!

The bad guys were different. They were mean and selfish. They lied and cheated. They only cared about themselves. They were greedy and always wanted more. They were angry and bossy. They thought they were the best and looked down on others. They were like dark clouds.

The wise teacher said the good guys were on the path to happiness. The bad guys were making themselves unhappy. He told Arjuna not to worry because he was a good guy, a shining star!

The bad guys didn't believe in being good. They thought the world was just a big mess, and only looked out for number one. They wanted everything, now! They were always jealous and angry. They only cared about themselves and getting richer and more powerful.  They boasted, "I'm the best! I'm so strong! I'll defeat anyone!"  They didn't share or help anyone. They were stuck in a circle of being mean and unhappy.

The wise teacher said there are three things that lead to unhappiness: wanting too much, being too angry, and being too greedy.  Arjuna needed to avoid these three bad things.  He should always follow the rules and do what is right, even if it's hard.  Then he would be happy and successful!  He should always listen to the wise teachers and follow their advice.
