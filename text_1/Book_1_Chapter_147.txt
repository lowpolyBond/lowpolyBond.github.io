Once upon a time, the Pandava brothers – Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva – had to leave their home.  They were sad.  Before they went, they hugged their family and friends. They bowed to their grandfather Bhishma, King Dhritarashtra, their teacher Drona, and other important people.  Even the little children said goodbye.

Many people were very upset. They cried and followed the Pandavas for a while.  They whispered, "King Dhritarashtra is unfair! He shouldn't make the Pandavas leave!"

Yudhishthira, even though he was sad, told everyone, "The King is our father. We must listen to him. Please go home now.  If you need us, you know where to find us.”

Then, a wise man named Vidura spoke secretly to Yudhishthira. He whispered a warning:  "Your new house is made of things that can catch fire easily!  Be careful!  And remember, if you stay calm and clever, you can overcome any problem."

Yudhishthira said he understood.  Vidura said goodbye.  Later, Kunti, their mother, asked Yudhishthira what Vidura had said. Yudhishthira explained the secret warning about the house.  He said Vidura also told him that being brave and sensible would help them.

The Pandavas set off on their journey. They traveled for many days until they arrived at their new home in Varanavata.  They looked at their new town and wondered what would happen next.
