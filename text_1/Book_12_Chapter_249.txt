Once upon a time, a wise teacher named Vyasa told a story about our minds and souls. He said our minds are like a spider spinning a web.  The web is made of thoughts and ideas, and it's all around us. But our soul is different. Itâ€™s like the spider itself, watching the web but not part of it.

The web is made of three things: happiness, sadness, and anger.  These things change all the time, making new parts of the web. Our soul, strong and powerful, watches over all these things without getting caught in them.

Some people think that when we get rid of sadness and anger through learning and being good, these feelings just disappear forever.  Others think these feelings might come back someday. It doesn't really matter which you believe, the important thing is to learn and be good.

Our soul is always there, it never begins and never ends. If we understand our soul, we can be happy even when things are hard. We won't get angry or sad easily. We'll cut the knots of worry in our hearts with our learning and kindness.

Think of people who only care about things in the world. They are like people who don't know how to swim and fall into a deep river. They are scared and struggle. But wise people are like those who can walk on solid ground. They know the truth, and they aren't afraid. They are peaceful and happy.  They understand that everything around them is changing all the time.

If we understand that everything, good and bad, has a beginning and an end, we will be happy.  This wisdom is very special.  People who have this wisdom don't worry about bad things happening. They aren't afraid of anything. They know that true happiness comes from understanding our souls.

When we do good things without wanting anything in return, it helps us get rid of past mistakes. But just doing good things isn't enough to make us completely happy.  It's understanding our soul that truly brings peace and happiness, and keeps us from suffering.  This is the best ending of all.
