Once upon a time, in a great arena, a strong warrior named Karna arrived.  He looked amazing! He was tall and handsome, like a shining sun.  Everyone gasped.  They didn't know who he was.

Karna was actually Arjuna's brother, but they didn't know each other yet. Karna was incredibly strong, like a lion or an elephant.  He spoke in a booming voice, like thunder, to Arjuna: "Brother! Watch me! I'll do even better than you!"

Arjuna was surprised and a little angry. Duryodhana, a prince who wanted Karna on his side, was thrilled! Karna showed off his amazing skills, doing everything Arjuna could do, and even better! Duryodhana was overjoyed.  He hugged Karna and made him a king! He gave him a whole kingdom and said, "Be my friend, and command me!" Karna was happy to be his friend. He just wanted to fight Arjuna.

Arjuna felt embarrassed. He told Karna, "You're not welcome here! I will defeat you!" Karna replied, "This arena is for everyone!  Let's fight!"

Before they fought, everyone wondered about Karna's family. Kripa, a wise man, asked Karna to tell everyone who his parents were. Karna looked sad.  Duryodhana quickly said, "If Arjuna only fights kings, we'll make Karna a king right now!"

And so, with trumpets and cheers, they made Karna a king! He was given a golden throne, flowers, and a big royal umbrella.  He was very grateful to Duryodhana.  He promised to be his friend forever. Now, the great battle between the brothers could begin!
