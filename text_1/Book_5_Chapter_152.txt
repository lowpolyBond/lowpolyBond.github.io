Krishna spoke, and everyone was happy!  The kings cheered loudly.  The Pandava army started to move.  It was a huge army!

Horses neighed, elephants trumpeted, and chariot wheels clattered.  Conches blew and drums beat.  It was very, very noisy!

The army was like a rushing river, full of soldiers, chariots, horses, and elephants.  Bhima led the way, followed by his brothers, Draupadi's sons, and many brave warriors.  The army was so big and strong!

King Yudhishthira followed, making sure everyone had what they needed: food, water, tents, even doctors for the sick soldiers.  Draupadi and the other women stayed safe in a special place.

The Pandavas gave gifts to the priests who blessed them.  Many other kings and heroes marched with them, all strong and ready to fight.  They had lots of chariots, horses, soldiers, and elephants.  

Behind Yudhishthira,  there were even more soldiers!  Arjuna and Krishna were surrounded by their best warriors.

When the army reached Kurukshetra, the battlefield, it was amazing! The Pandavas blew their horns.  Arjunaâ€™s conch shell, Panchajanya, sounded like thunder! The warriors roared, and the whole world seemed to shake with the noise. They were ready for battle!
