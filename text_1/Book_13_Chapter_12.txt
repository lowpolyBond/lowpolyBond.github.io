King Yudhishthira had a question.  He wanted to know: who enjoys being together more, a man or a woman?

King Bhishma told a story to answer.  Long ago, there was a very good king named Bhangaswana. He was a wise king, but he had no children. He did a special prayer to the fire god to ask for a child.

The god Indra didn't like this prayer.  Indra wanted to trick the king. He tried to find something wrong the king had done, but he couldn't!

One day, the king went hunting. Indra used magic to confuse him. The king got lost and very thirsty. He found a beautiful lake and went for a swim.  Splash! When he came out, he was a woman!

He was so surprised! He thought, "How will I ride my horse? How will I see my sons, my wives, my people?"  He was very sad.

With great effort, the queen who was now a woman, rode her horse back to the city. Everyone was shocked to see her!

She told them what happened.  She gave the kingdom to her sons and went to live in the forest.  There, she met a kind holy man, and they had one hundred more sons!

She brought all her sons – the first hundred and the new hundred – to the city.  They all lived together happily, sharing the kingdom.

But Indra was still angry! He tricked the brothers into fighting each other. They fought and sadly, many died.

The queen, now living as a woman in the forest, was heartbroken. Indra, disguised as a holy man, found her and asked why she was so sad.

She told him everything. Indra revealed himself. He said he was angry because the king hadn't honored him in his prayer.

The queen was sorry.  Indra offered to bring her sons back to life. He asked her which sons she wanted to save: the sons she had as a man, or the sons she had as a woman?

The queen chose the sons she had as a woman. Indra was curious. Why?

She said, "Women feel much more joy when they are together with someone they love."

Indra was impressed. He brought all her sons back to life, and asked if she wanted to be a man again.  She said no. She was happy being a woman.

So, King Bhishma finished the story.  He told Yudhishthira that the story showed: women usually feel more joy when they are with someone they love than men do.
