Long ago, there was a wise man named Chyavana.  Chyavana had a son named Pramati, who had a son named Ruru. Ruru was a very strong and kind young man. He fell in love with a beautiful girl named Pramadvara.

Pramadvara wasn't born in a palace. She was found as a baby near a river by a kind old wise man named Sthulakesa.  He found her all alone, and because she was so beautiful, he took care of her and raised her as his own daughter.  She grew up to be very good and beautiful.

Ruru wanted to marry Pramadvara.  His father helped him ask Pramadvara's father, Sthulakesa, for her hand in marriage.  They set a wedding date.

But sadly, just before the wedding, Pramadvara was playing with her friends when she stepped on a snake! The snake bit her, and Pramadvara fell down, lifeless.  She was so beautiful, but now she looked very sick.

Ruru was heartbroken. He loved Pramadvara very much.  Many wise men and women came to see Pramadvara, and they were all very sad.  Ruru was so sad, he couldn't even stay near her.

That's the story of Ruru and Pramadvara so far.  What will happen next?
