Long ago, a king named Kusika wanted a very special son. He prayed and prayed, and a powerful god answered his prayers! The god became the king's son, and his name was Gadhi.

Gadhi had a daughter named Satyavati.  Satyavati married a wise man named Richika. Richika made special magic food. One part was for Satyavati, and one for her mother.  But by mistake, Satyavati’s mother ate Satyavati’s portion!

Because of this mistake, Satyavati had a baby boy who was very, very strong and a great warrior, but also very angry.  His name was Rama.  He was so strong that he could defeat many, many other warriors.

A powerful king, Arjuna, who had a thousand arms, was very kind. But his sons were not. Rama, angry about something, cut off Arjuna's arms!  Then,  Arjuna's sons killed Rama's father!

Rama was furious! He fought and defeated so many warriors, killing thousands! He was so powerful that he almost wiped out all the warriors in the land.  He was so angry, he even killed babies!

After a long time, other warriors started to grow up. Rama fought them too!  Finally, a wise man named Kasyapa told Rama to move away. The earth was tired of all the fighting.

Kasyapa helped find new warrior kings to rule the land. These new kings were the ancestors of many kings who came after them.  So, that’s the story of Rama and the many warriors who fought long ago!  It shows that even great strength can’t solve all problems.
