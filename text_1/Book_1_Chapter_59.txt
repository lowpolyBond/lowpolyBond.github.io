Once upon a time, a wise old man named Saunaka asked Sauti, a storyteller, to tell him a really long and amazing story.  Saunaka had already heard a lot, but he wanted to hear more!

Saunaka said, "Sauti, you've told me so many stories about the family of Bhrigu.  I loved it! Now, tell me the story Vyasa wrote. Tell me all the fun stories the wise Brahmins told each other during a very, very long ceremony."

Sauti said, "The Brahmins talked about many things from the holy Vedas. But the best story was the amazing Bharata story that Vyasa told."

Saunaka said, "I really want to hear the Mahabharata! It's the story about the Pandavas, the great heroes.  King Janamejaya asked Vyasa to tell it, and it's so amazing! It's like it came from the biggest, wisest ocean of a mind! Please, tell me the whole story!"

Sauti smiled. "I will! I'll tell you the whole, wonderful Mahabharata story from the very beginning. It's a great story, and I love telling it!"
