King Yudhishthira asked his grandfather Bhishma, "Grandfather, I'm curious! What good things happen to people who do good things? What happens if you keep your promises? What if you study hard? What if you give things away?  What if you're kind and don't get angry?"

Bhishma smiled.  "Yudhishthira, keeping your promises brings you happiness, both now and later. Studying the holy books brings joy here and in the afterlife. Giving things away helps you too.  But the best thing is to be self-controlled – to control your anger and desires."

"Self-control is even better than giving gifts!" Bhishma explained. "Someone who gives gifts might still get angry. But a person who controls themselves never does.  Self-controlled people are happy, they can do anything they set their minds to, and they can beat any enemy!  They get everything they want!"

"Being self-controlled is like a magic key," Bhishma continued. "It opens the door to many wonderful places in heaven, places where wise people live.  Being a teacher who shares wisdom is also amazing. It brings endless happiness."

"For everyone," Bhishma said, "doing their job well is important.  A soldier who fights bravely, a farmer who works hard, a servant who serves well – they all get rewarded.  There are many kinds of heroes, Yudhishthira.  Heroes of kindness, heroes of truth, heroes of bravery – all reach happy places."

Bhishma said, "Truth is the most important thing of all! It's more important than even a thousand great sacrifices.  The sun, the fire, the wind – everything works because of truth.  Truth makes the gods happy.  Tell the truth always, Yudhishthira."

"Being self-controlled and truthful is wonderful, but living a life of service is also great," Bhishma added.  "Serving your parents and teachers brings you to heaven.  If you're kind and good, you'll never have to go to a bad place."

Bhishma concluded, "So, Yudhishthira, do good things, be truthful, be self-controlled, and be kind. These are the best ways to be happy now and in the afterlife."
