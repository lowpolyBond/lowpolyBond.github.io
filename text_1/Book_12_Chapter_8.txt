Arjuna was angry!  He looked fierce, like a grumpy lion.  He frowned and said, "King, you just won a huge battle! You're the king of the whole land! Why are you giving it all up?  It's silly!"

Arjuna explained, "Kings don't become beggars!  Beggars don't have power or friends or anything nice. They can't even feed their families! What will people say? You're a king! You fought hard to win all this land! Why go live in the forest and become poor?"

He continued, "If you leave, bad people will do bad things.  They'll ruin everything!  Even Nahusha, a powerful king, learned that being poor is terrible.  Kings need money to be good kings!  Money helps them take care of everyone and perform important ceremonies."

"Poor people are often blamed for things they didn't do," Arjuna said. "Money brings happiness, friends, and respect. It helps you do good things!  Without money, you can't even eat!  It's like a river; if there's no water, the river dries up. Even the gods fight to get things, to get rich and powerful. They know that wealth is important."

"Kings use the wealth they get to help everyone," Arjuna reminded him. "They perform big, important ceremonies to keep everyone happy and safe.  Great kings in the past, like Dilipa and Nahusha, were rich and powerful.  Now itâ€™s your turn! You should have a giant ceremony with lots of food and gifts.  This will make everyone happy and blessed. Don't throw it all away!"
