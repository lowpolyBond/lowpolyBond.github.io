Once upon a time, during a great battle, a brave young warrior named Abhimanyu fought like a hero.  He was strong and handsome, like a god!  He held a powerful weapon, and his enemies were scared.

Abhimanyu was so brave that even the gods couldn't look at him without being amazed!  But the enemy warriors were many. They broke his chariot, took away his weapons, one by one.  Abhimanyu wasn't defeated!  He grabbed a big club and fought on!

He bravely faced Aswatthaman, a powerful enemy, and even knocked him off his chariot!  He defeated many, many soldiers.  He smashed chariots and elephants. He was covered in arrows but he fought on, like a brave porcupine!


Then, Abhimanyu fought Duhsasana's son. They fought hard, hitting each other with their clubs until they both fell. Duhsasana's son got up first and hit Abhimanyu hard on the head.  The brave young warrior fell, tired and hurt.  Many enemies attacked him and Abhimanyu died bravely.


When Abhimanyu fell, the enemy warriors cheered. But the Pandavas, Abhimanyu's family and friends, were very sad.  Abhimanyu looked like a tired lion, or a great tree that had fallen.  The battlefield was covered in broken weapons, dead soldiers and elephants. It was a terrible sight.

Even the birds in the sky cried out sadly because Abhimanyu had fought so bravely all alone against many enemies.  King Yudhishthira, Abhimanyu's uncle, tried to comfort his sad soldiers. He reminded them how brave Abhimanyu was, and how many enemies he defeated. He told them that Abhimanyu was a true hero, and he was now in heaven, a wonderful place for brave warriors.  Even though they were sad, they remembered Abhimanyu's bravery and fought on.
