The Pandava brothers – Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva – were hunting in the forest.  They saw lots of deer and birds, but the animals seemed very scared and noisy.

Yudhishthira said, "Something is wrong!  It feels like danger is near. Let's go home."

They started back.  They saw a jackal howling. Yudhishthira thought, "That sounds like the Kauravas are causing trouble!"

When they reached their home, their servant girl, Dhatreyika, was crying.  Arjuna, very worried, asked, "What's wrong? Is Draupadi okay?"

Dhatreyika sobbed, "Jayadratha, a bad man, has taken Draupadi away!  Follow the marks he left behind!"

She was very upset.  She said, "Don't let anyone hurt Draupadi! She is precious to us!"  Yudhishthira told Dhatreyika to calm down.

The brothers followed the trail. They saw a big cloud of dust – Jayadratha's army!  They even saw their wise teacher, Dhaumya.  He told them to hurry.

The Pandavas were furious! They saw Jayadratha's chariot with Draupadi on it.  They shouted and charged, ready to fight!  Jayadratha and his army were so scared, they didn't know what to do.
