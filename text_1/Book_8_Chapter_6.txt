King Dhritarashtra asked Sanjaya, "Sanjaya, you told me who from my army died fighting the Pandavas. Now, tell me who from the Pandavas' army died fighting my men!"

Sanjaya answered, "Many brave Pandava warriors died.  Bhishma, a great warrior, killed many of Kunti's sons and their friends. He also killed many other brave Pandava heroes.  

Drona, another strong warrior, killed Satyajit, who was as strong as Arjuna.  He also killed many strong Pancala warriors and even King Virata and King Drupada, along with their sons.

Abhimanyu was very young, but he was a brave warrior like Arjuna.  He fought many enemies before six strong warriors surrounded him and killed him.  They were afraid to fight Arjuna, so they killed his son instead. Abhimanyu fought bravely even after his chariot was broken. Then, Duhshasana's son killed him.

Another brave Pandava warrior, the son of Amvashtha, fought hard and killed many enemies.  But Lakshmana, Duryodhana's son, killed him.

Duhshasana also killed Vrihanta, another strong warrior.  Drona killed the strong kings Manimat and Dandadhara. He also killed Ansumat, the king of the Bhojas, and Citrasena, a king who lived by the sea, along with his son.

Ashwatthama killed Nila and Vyaghradatta, two more brave kings. Vikarna killed Citrayudha and Citrayodhin.  A Kaikeya warrior killed his own brother, the Kaikeya chief.  Durmukha, your son, killed Janamejaya. Drona killed the Rochamana brothers. Many other brave kings fighting for the Pandavas also died.

Drona killed Purujit and Kuntibhoja, who were Savyasaci's uncles. Vasudana's son killed Abhibhu, the Kasi king.  Our warriors killed Yudhamanyu and Uttamauja, even though they killed many of our men first.  Drona also killed Mitravarman and Kshatradeva, Shikhandi's son.  He also killed Sucitra and Citravarman.  Vardhakshemi fought bravely until he was very tired and died. Senavindu, a great warrior, was killed by Bahlika. Dhrishtaketu died, and so did Satyadhriti.  Drona killed Suketu, Shishupala's son.  Virata's son Sankha and Uttara also died, as did Satyadhriti, Madiraswa, and Suryadatta. Srenimat died bravely, too.  Bhishma killed the Magadha king.  Bharadwajaâ€™s son killed Vasudana.

Many other strong Pandava warriors died in battle. I have told you about all the warriors you asked me about, my King."
