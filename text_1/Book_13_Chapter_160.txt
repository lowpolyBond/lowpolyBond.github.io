King Yudhishthira asked Krishna, "Krishna, tell me about the great and powerful god Shiva!  Tell me all his names and how wonderful he is!"

Krishna said, "I will tell you about the amazing things I learned about Shiva.  He is the most powerful god in the whole universe!  Brahma, the creator god, himself, created special prayers to honor Shiva.  Shiva created everything, all the animals and plants. No one is more powerful than him.

When Shiva gets angry, it's scary!  Even the gods are afraid.  His roar is like thunder.  Just looking at him when he's angry makes people faint!  Once, a god named Daksha didn't treat Shiva with respect. Shiva was so angry, he destroyed Daksha's big party!  The whole world shook!  The sky cracked!  It was very dark and frightening.  The other gods were terrified and they prayed to Shiva to calm down.

Another time, powerful giants had three magical cities—one made of iron, one of silver, and one of gold.  The gods couldn't defeat them. They asked Shiva for help.  Shiva made a super-powerful arrow!  He used the sun, fire, and even the wind to make it.  He shot the arrow, and *whoosh!*  He destroyed the giant's cities!

Once, Shiva appeared as a little baby with five tufts of hair.  Even the mighty Indra, king of the gods, tried to hurt the baby, but the baby was too powerful! Indra’s arm froze!  Everyone was amazed.  Only then did they realize the baby was Shiva!  Brahma, the creator god, praised the baby Shiva.  Then Indra’s arm became normal again.

Shiva is many gods in one! He is Rudra, Shiva, Agni, Sarva, Indra, the wind god, and so many more!  He's even the sun, moon, and time itself! He is everywhere and in everything. He is amazing! It would take a hundred years to tell you all about him."
