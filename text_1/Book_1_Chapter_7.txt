Once upon a time, a wise man named Bhrigu got angry at Agni, the god of fire.  Bhrigu cursed Agni!

Agni was sad. He said, "Why are you so angry? I only told the truth!  If someone knows something and lies, it's bad for their whole family. If someone knows something and doesn't tell the truth when asked, it's also bad!"

Agni was very important. He was in every home, every big ceremony, every wedding.  He helped people make offerings to the gods and their ancestors.  He explained that he was the mouth of the gods and ancestors. They all ate the food offered through Agni's flames.  But Bhrigu's curse made Agni worry that he would have to eat anything, even bad things!

Agni felt so bad, he left!  No one could perform any ceremonies without him.  The whole world was upset.  The wise men went to the gods, and they all went to Brahma, the creator of the world.

Brahma told Agni, "You are very important! You create and destroy! You are pure! But the curse will happen, just a little part of you will eat anything. Your flames will purify everything they touch.  Your main job, eating the offerings, will continue."

Agni agreed.  He was happy because his main job would still be good and pure. The wise men could perform their ceremonies again, and everyone was joyful!

And that's how Agni was cursed and then helped to solve the problem!  This is a story from a long time ago, connected to another story about a powerful demon.
