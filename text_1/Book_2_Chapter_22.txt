Rama looked at his brother Lakshmana. Lakshmana was very angry with Kaikeyi! He was breathing hard, like a big elephant.  Rama spoke softly to Lakshmana.  "Brother," he said, "don't be angry. Be patient. Forget about my coronation. Let's get ready to go to the forest."

"Prepare for our journey, just like you prepared for my coronation," Rama explained. "Mother Kaikeyi is worried I'll take the throne by force.  She thinks you'll help me. I don't want her to worry. I've never done anything wrong to my parents."

"Let's also make sure our father isn't worried," Rama continued. "He's a good king, but he's scared now. If I don't leave, he'll be very sad.  I don't want that. I'd rather go to the forest."

"If I leave, Kaikeyi will be happy. She'll give the kingdom to Bharata, her son.  She wants me to go to the forest.  That's why I'll go, immediately.  Being king isn't my destiny. If it were, this wouldn't be happening."

"I treated all my mothers the same," Rama said. "Kaikeyi never treated me differently from Bharata.  But today, she was very mean. This is fate.  Even powerful people can't escape what is meant to be.  This is all because of what happened before."

"Good things and bad things, happy times and sad times – it's all because of what we've done before," Rama explained. "Even wise people can make mistakes.  This is happening because of fate, so I'm not sad. Don't be sad either, Lakshmana."

"Let's use this water, brought for my coronation, to start our forest life," Rama said.  "I won't need these special ceremonies anymore.  I'll get my own water."

"Don't be upset about the coronation," Rama told Lakshmana. "Being a king and living in the forest – it's not so different. Don't blame Kaikeyi.  She couldn't help it.  It was fate."
