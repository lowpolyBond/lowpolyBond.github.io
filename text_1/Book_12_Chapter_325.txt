Once upon a time, there was a wise Rishi named Vyasa.  He had a magical power.  One day, he was making fire by rubbing sticks together.  Suddenly, he saw a beautiful Apsara (a heavenly nymph) named Ghritachi.

Vyasa was very attracted to her.  Ghritachi, seeing this, cleverly changed into a parrot!  But Vyasa still felt the same way. He tried very hard to stop thinking about her. He kept rubbing the sticks, trying to focus on making a fire.  

But even though he tried really hard, some of his special life energy fell to the ground.  From that energy, a baby boy was born!  Because he was born near the fire-sticks, they named him Suka.

Everyone was amazed!  The sky rained flowers, and beautiful music filled the air.  Gods and goddesses came to celebrate!  They gave Suka gifts, like magical clothes and a special water pot.

Suka was a very special boy.  Even as a baby, he knew all the sacred books and stories (the Vedas!).  He learned even more from a great teacher named Vrihaspati.

When Suka grew up, he was a very holy man. He spent his life learning and praying. He wasn't interested in normal life; he only wanted to be close to God.  He was a very wise and respected person, loved by everyone.
