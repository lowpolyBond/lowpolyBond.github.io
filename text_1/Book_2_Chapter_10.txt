Once upon a time, there was a wicked woman named Manthara. She tricked Queen Kaikeyi into being very upset.  Kaikeyi cried and rolled on the ground like a hurt bird.  Manthara secretly helped her plan something bad.

Kaikeyi was jealous. She pulled out her eyebrows and threw her pretty jewelry on the floor. She looked sad and messy.  She looked like a beautiful fairy who had fallen from the sky.

King Dasaratha was very happy. He was getting ready to make his son, Rama, a prince.  He went to tell his wives the good news.  First, he went to see Queen Kaikeyi.

The king walked through a beautiful garden.  Pretty birds sang, and little maids worked in the palace.  The palace was full of flowers, delicious food, and shiny things.  It was like a magical place.

But the king couldn't find Kaikeyi! He called out, but she didn't answer.  A scared servant told him, "She's in the 'anger room'."

The king was worried. He found Kaikeyi lying on the floor.  He loved her very much, even though she was much younger. He felt so sad to see her like that.  He asked her, "What's wrong? Are you sick?  Tell me what I can do to help you.  I will do anything for you! I'm king of many lands, and I will give you anything you want!"

The king was so kind. He promised to do whatever she wanted.  But Kaikeyi was still angry. She used this chance to be mean and make a terrible request.
