King Dhritarashtra asked his friend Sanjaya, "Sanjaya, tell me about all the rivers, mountains, countries, and everything else on Earth! Tell me how big they all are!"

Sanjaya said, "Great King, wise people say everything is made of five things: space, air, fire, water, and earth.  Space makes sound. Air you can feel. Fire you can see. Water you can taste. Earth you can smell.  Each thing has the qualities of the ones before it, too! Earth has all the qualities! Water has four, but not smell. Fire has three. Air has two, and space only has sound.  All living things are made from these five things.  Sometimes these things are all separate.  But when they mix together, living things are born. They disappear and reappear, one changing into the other, over and over.  It's all very big and mysterious – even bigger than we can imagine!"

Then Sanjaya told the King about a magical island called Sudarsana. "This island, Your Majesty, is round like a wheel! It's covered with rivers, mountains that look like clouds, beautiful cities, and lots of yummy fruits and vegetables! It’s surrounded by the salty ocean.  Look closely at the moon – sometimes you can see Sudarsana Island there, like a reflection in a mirror! It looks like a peepul tree in some places, and like a big rabbit in others! It's surrounded by lots and lots of trees, and the rest is mostly water. There's so much more to tell you about it, but I'll save that for later."
