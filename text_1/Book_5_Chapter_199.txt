King Yudhishthira, Kunti's brave son, got ready for a big battle!  He gathered his amazing army.  First, he called his best fighters: Dhrishtadyumna, Virata, Drupada, Yuyudhana, and Sikhandin.  There were also the twin princes of Panchala, Yudhamanyu and Uttamaujas. They were strong and shiny, like stars in the sky, all dressed in shining armor.

Then, Yudhishthira sent Abhimanyu, the five sons of Draupadi, and other brave warriors with Dhrishtadyumna to lead the way.  Next came Bhima and Arjuna in another group.  The whole army was noisy! Elephants trumpeted, horses neighed, and soldiers shouted happily.  It was so loud it sounded like it reached the sky!

King Yudhishthira marched last, with Virata and Drupada beside him. His army was huge, like a giant river flowing!  He put his army into clever groups, so the Kauravas wouldn't know what to expect.  He even put Abhimanyu, the five sons of Draupadi, Nakula, and Sahadeva into Bhima's group!  

In the middle, there was Virata, Jayatsena, the two Panchala princes, Krishna, and Arjuna.  Many soldiers marched around them; they had horses, elephants, and chariots.  Behind them came more soldiers, and even more behind them, all ready to fight!

Yudhishthira himself was surrounded by lots of kings and soldiers.  Even more elephants, horses, and chariots were behind them.  Satyaki, a super strong warrior, marched with his own large group of soldiers and chariots.

At the very back were the wagons, supplies, and all the people who weren't fighting:  women, children, and the sick.  They moved slowly, with many elephants carrying all their things.  Many other brave kings and warriors followed behind, including a huge number of elephants, horses, and chariots!

Yudhishthiraâ€™s army was so big and powerful!  It was ready to fight Duryodhana and the Kauravas. The soldiers were happy and excited.  They beat their drums and blew their horns, making a huge noise!  And so the great battle was about to begin!
