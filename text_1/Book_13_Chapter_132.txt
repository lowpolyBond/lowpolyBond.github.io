Long ago, a wise god named Brahman lived.  He saw a giant snake named Renuka living underground. Brahman said, "Renuka is very strong!  He should ask the giant elephants who hold up the world a question."

Brahman told the other gods to ask Renuka to talk to the elephants.  The gods agreed.

Renuka went to the elephants. He said, "The gods want to know the secret to being good and doing the right thing.  Tell me your wisdom!"

The eight elephants, one in each direction, answered, "There's a special day to show respect. It's the eighth day of the dark part of the month of Karttika, when the Aslesha star shines. On that day, give gifts of sweet food and rice.  Be kind, eat healthy food, and say these special words:"

The elephants told Renuka some special words to say.  These words were a prayer to ask powerful snakes for strength. They said to make the offerings on an anthill, with flowers and sweet things, and blue cloth.

The elephants explained, "If people do this, we'll feel less tired from holding up the world! It's good for everyone, no matter who they are."  They said that doing this for a whole year would make people very good.

All the gods and wise people were happy to hear the elephants' answer. They all praised Renuka for being so brave and clever.
