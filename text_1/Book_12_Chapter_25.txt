Once upon a time, after a big battle, King Yudhisthira was very sad.  He had lost many family members.  He felt terrible hearing the women cry because their husbands and sons were gone.  He told the wise man Vyasa that being king didn't make him happy anymore.  His sadness was too big.

Vyasa, who was super smart, told Yudhisthira something important. He said, "Yudhisthira, nothing happens just because we want it to.  Everything is decided by Time.  Sometimes a lucky person gets rich, and sometimes a smart person doesn't.  Time decides it all!"

Vyasa explained how Time makes everything happen.  Time makes the wind blow, the rain fall, flowers bloom, and the moon grow big and small.  Time makes babies born and people grow old.  Even things like winning a battle or losing a loved one – Time decides when these things happen.

Vyasa told a story about a king who was sad. This king learned that  we can't stop things like birth, death, and sadness.  We should not be controlled by sadness because it only gets worse when we think about it.  Nothing truly belongs to us.

Vyasa said that being sad all the time is silly.  There are happy times and sad times, and that's just how life is.  Instead of being upset, we should accept both happiness and sadness.  We can't control them, but we can control how we feel about them.  Try not to let your sadness take over.

Vyasa then told Yudhisthira how a good king should rule.  A king should be fair to everyone, be brave in battle, be generous, and be wise.  By doing good things and ruling well, even after they die, they’ll live on happily in heaven.
