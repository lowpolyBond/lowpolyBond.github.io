Yudhishthira felt very sad.  He said, "Grandfather, so many people died in the war! My brothers, cousins, friends, even my teachers – so many brave warriors are gone.  I wanted to be king, and because of that, so many good people died. I feel terrible. All those wonderful kings, who were always kind and fair, are gone.  The queens and princesses are heartbroken.  They lost their husbands, sons, and brothers. They will be so sad, they might even die of grief. I feel guilty.  I did this, and now we’ll all go to a bad place."

His grandfather, Vyasa, a very wise man, listened. He said, “Yudhishthira, don’t be so upset.  All those warriors died doing what they should. They were brave and fought hard.  It wasn’t just you, or Bhima, or Arjuna who made them die. It was Time.  Time takes everyone eventually, just like the sun sets every day. Time is like a big clock, counting down for everyone.  The war was just a moment in Time.  Time makes people die, using other people to do it, like a gardener using a tool to cut flowers.  Think about what those warriors did in their lives – their good actions and bad ones.  Those actions helped bring them to this day.  You fought because you had to, just like a soldier follows orders. The world keeps going, even though people are born and die. Happiness and sadness are part of life, but don’t let sadness take over you. If you feel guilty, do some good deeds to make things right.”

Vyasa told Yudhishthira a story about the gods and demons who fought a huge war.  The gods won, and many demons died.  Sometimes, even when we do something that seems bad, it’s to protect others or our kingdom.  Vyasa said, "You did what a king had to do. You are a good person, Yudhishthira. You did your duty.  Don't worry about what happened.  You are not a bad person because you fought.  Celebrate your win, but do it in a kind way.  Help the people who are sad, give their families a home, and make sure the kingdom is safe.  Then, offer a big prayer to thank the gods and to help you feel better. You fought a big war, but you aren't a bad person.  You did your best, that's what matters."
