Duryodhana asked Bhishma, "Why won't you kill Sikhandin in battle?  You promised to kill all the Panchalas!"

Bhishma said, "Let me tell you a story. My father, King Santanu, died. I put my brother Chitrangada on the throne.  After he died, I put my other brother, Vichitravirya, on the throne.  He was young, and looked up to me.  I wanted to find him good wives."

"I heard about three beautiful sisters â€“ Amva, Amvika, and Amvalika.  They were princesses!  All the kings wanted to marry them. So, I went to get them for my brother."

"I went to their city in my chariot. I saw the princesses and all the other kings.  I challenged them all to a fight! I said, 'I'm taking these princesses! Try to stop me!'"

"All the kings attacked!  They had chariots, elephants, and horses! It was a huge battle! But I was very strong. I fought bravely and defeated all the kings with my arrows.  I easily broke their flags and knocked down their soldiers and animals.  The kings gave up."

"Then I took the princesses back home and gave them to Satyavati to marry my brother."  "That's why I can't kill Sikhandin," Bhishma explained. "It's because of what happened that day long ago.  This is a very long story. So it's a matter of honor and it shows why I do what I do."
