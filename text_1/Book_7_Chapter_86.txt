Sanjaya said, "King Dhritarashtra, I saw everything!  Listen carefully. You made a big mistake.  Your sadness is like a broken dam after the flood â€“ it can't stop the water! Don't worry.  Even the strongest people can't change what's already happened. This is not new; bad things have happened before.

If you had stopped your son Duryodhana from gambling and fighting, this wouldn't have happened. If you had stopped the war, this wouldn't have happened. If you had told Duryodhana to be good, this wouldn't have happened!  Then the Pandavas and their friends wouldn't be angry with you.  You're a wise king, but you listened to Duryodhana, Karna, and Sakuni instead of doing what's right. Your sadness is like honey with poison.

Krishna used to respect you very much, more than anyone else. But when you didn't do what was right, he stopped respecting you.  Your sons were mean to the Pandavas, and you didn't stop them. Now, you're paying the price.  Your family's kingdom is in danger!  The Pandavas earned that kingdom. You took it away from them.

Now the war has started, and you're blaming your sons. That's not fair!  Warriors don't worry about dying in battle.  Only the Kauravas are brave enough to fight the Pandavas.  They have strong warriors like Arjuna, Krishna, Satyaki, and Bhima! Who else would fight such strong heroes?  The Kauravas are doing their best.  Now, I will tell you everything that happened in that terrible battle between the Kauravas and the Pandavas."
