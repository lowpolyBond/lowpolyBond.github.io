Sanjaya told the story:  Satyaki, a super strong warrior, had already defeated many Kaurava soldiers.  He laughed and told his driver, "We just finished what Krishna and Arjuna already started!  We're just helping clean up!"

Satyaki was so brave!  He fought like a hawk hunting for its prey.  Lots of Kaurava soldiers attacked him, but they couldn't stop him. He was like a bright sun, shining through their army on his shiny white horses. No one could defeat him!

Then, Sudarsana, another strong king, attacked Satyaki.  They fought a HUGE battle! It was so amazing, everyone watched and cheered, saying it was like the great god Indra fighting the demon Vritra!

Sudarsana shot many arrows at Satyaki, but Satyaki was too fast!  Satyaki’s arrows broke Sudarsana’s arrows in half.  Sudarsana got angry and shot more arrows. This time, some arrows hit Satyaki.

But Satyaki was even stronger! He quickly shot arrows and killed all of Sudarsana’s horses.  Then, with one powerful arrow, he cut off Sudarsana’s driver’s head!  With another arrow, he cut off Sudarsana's head!

Satyaki was so happy he'd won!  He was as bright and strong as the god Indra.  He followed the same path Arjuna had taken, shooting arrows and defeating all the Kaurava soldiers in his way. Everyone was amazed by his power! He was like a big fire, burning up all his enemies!
