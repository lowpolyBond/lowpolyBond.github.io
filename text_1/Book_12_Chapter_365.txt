Once upon a time, a wise man, a Brahmin, went to see a great snake king.  The Brahmin was very happy to talk to the snake king. He learned a lot from him.  The Brahmin said, “Thank you, great snake. I’ve learned so much.  I must go now, but please remember me.”

The snake king said, “You haven’t told me why you came! Where are you going?  Stay a while! Everyone in my city is your friend.  You’re welcome to stay in my home.”

The Brahmin explained, "I was confused about what is the best way to live a good life.  Your words helped me understand. I've decided to follow a special way of life called 'Unccha'.  I’ve learned what I needed to learn. Thank you!”

The Brahmin left the snake king. He was excited to follow this new path. He went to see another wise man, Chyavana, to learn more about the Unccha way of life.  Chyavana taught him everything he needed to know.

The story of the Brahmin and the snake king was told again and again! Chyavana told King Janaka. King Janaka told Narada, a very holy man. Narada told Indra, the king of the gods! Indra told many other wise people.  Even Bhishma, a great warrior, heard this story many times.

Bhishma told the story to a king who wanted to know what is the best way to live. The Brahmin, having learned the Unccha way, lived a very good life, eating only the right things and always doing what was right.

The End.
