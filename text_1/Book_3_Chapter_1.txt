Once upon a time, the Pandava brothers – Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva – were tricked in a game by their cousins, the Kauravas.  The Kauravas were mean and wanted all the power.  The Pandavas lost everything!  Even their beautiful wife, Draupadi, was treated very badly.

Yudhishthira, the eldest brother, was very sad.  He, his brothers, and Draupadi had to leave their home. They walked out of the city, with their friends and servants following behind in sadness.  Many people were upset with the Kauravas for being so unfair. They felt sorry for the Pandavas.  The people cried, "This is not right! The Kauravas are mean!"

The people wanted to follow the Pandavas into the forest, but Yudhishthira asked them to stay behind.  He said, "Please take care of our family who are still in the city.  They need your help."  The people were very sad but they obeyed the kind Yudhishthira.

The Pandavas travelled north.  They reached a big banyan tree by the Ganges River. They were very tired and hungry. That night, they only drank water. Some kind priests and their students came and spent the night with them.  The priests chanted beautiful prayers, and everyone felt a little better.  This was the start of their 12 years in the forest.  It was a long and hard time, but the Pandavas were brave and good.
