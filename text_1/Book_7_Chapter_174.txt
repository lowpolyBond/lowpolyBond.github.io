Once upon a time, in a great battle, a powerful giant named Ghatotkacha was heading towards Karna, a warrior on a chariot.  Duryodhana, a king, was worried.  He told his brother, "Ghatotkacha is very strong!  Help Karna!"  Many soldiers rushed to protect Karna.

Then, another giant, Alamvusha, came to Duryodhana. He said, "I want to fight for you! I want to avenge my father, who was killed by the Pandavas (the good guys)." Duryodhana was happy and said, "Go and fight Ghatotkacha!"

Alamvusha fought bravely. But Ghatotkacha was even stronger! He easily defeated many soldiers.  Alamvusha threw many arrows, but Ghatotkacha was like a storm,  defeating everyone.  Both sides ran away!

Alamvusha got very angry. He fought Ghatotkacha hard. They hit each other with everything they had: swords, clubs, and even their fists!  They even changed shapes—like magic!—into lions, mountains, and even the sun and moon!  It was a super wild fight!

Finally, Ghatotkacha grabbed Alamvusha and chopped off his head!  He took the head and threw it onto Duryodhana's chariot. He roared, "Your friend is dead! Now I'm coming for Karna!"  Then, Ghatotkacha attacked Karna, shooting many, many arrows.  The battle was fierce and amazing!
