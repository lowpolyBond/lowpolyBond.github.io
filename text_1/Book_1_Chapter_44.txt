Once upon a time, King Parikshit was bitten by a giant snake named Takshaka!  The snake was HUGE and bright red, like a streak of paint across the sky.

The king's helpers were scared. They screamed and ran away! The palace even caught on fire from Takshakaâ€™s poisonous bite.  Poor King Parikshit fell down, just like he'd been hit by lightning.

Sadly, the king died. His helpers and a wise priest gave him a proper goodbye.  Then, everyone chose Parikshit's little son to be the new king.  His name was Janamejaya. Even though he was a child, he was very smart and brave.

Janamejaya, with his helpers, ruled the kingdom just like his great-great-grandfather, Yudhishthira, had.  They wanted to find him a wife. They asked a nearby king for his daughter, Vapushtama, to marry Janamejaya.  The king said yes!

Janamejaya was very happy with his new wife. She was beautiful and loved him very much.  They had lots of fun, exploring lakes, forests, and fields of flowers.  Janamejaya was a happy king, just like a king from a long, long time ago who married a magical fairy!
