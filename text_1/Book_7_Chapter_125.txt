The battle was HUGE!  The Pandava army was losing badly.  Lots of soldiers were running away.  Drona, a super strong warrior, was shouting really loud.  Yudhishthira, the Pandava king, was worried. He looked around but couldn't see his brothers, Arjuna and Bhima, or his friend Satyaki.  He was very scared.

Yudhishthira thought, "Where are Arjuna and Satyaki?  People will say bad things if I don't look for them!" He worried about both equally. He had already sent Satyaki to help Arjuna, who was fighting deep inside the enemy army.  "Who can I send to find them?" he wondered.

Then he had a great idea!  "Bhima is the strongest! He can help them both!" he said.  Yudhishthira asked his driver to take him to Bhima.  He was so upset, he was crying!

"Bhima," Yudhishthira said sadly, "I can't see Arjuna's flag!  I think he's been hurt or worse!"

Bhima was shocked. He'd never seen his brother so sad. "Don't worry," Bhima said. "Tell me what to do! I'll do anything!"

Yudhishthira explained that he heard Krishna's conch shell blowing angrily. That meant Arjuna was probably in trouble.  Arjuna had gone after a bad guy, and Satyaki had followed Arjuna to help him.  "I can't see Arjuna's flag or Satyaki! I'm so scared they are hurt or dead!" cried Yudhishthira.

"Bhima," Yudhishthira said, "Please, go find Arjuna and Satyaki.  They are both brave and strong, but they need help. Remember, Satyaki is just as important to me as Arjuna.  He's a really good friend and went to help Arjuna because he cares about us. Please, go find them and bring back good news!"

Bhima, brave and strong, promised to go and find his brother and Satyaki. Yudhishthira felt a little better knowing his strongest brother was going to help.
