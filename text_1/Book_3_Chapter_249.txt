Once upon a time, after the Pandavas won back their kingdom, Duryodhana, the Kaurava prince, was very sad. He refused to eat, wanting to die.  His uncle, Shakuni, tried to cheer him up.

"Duryodhana," Shakuni said, "Don't be silly!  The Pandavas gave you back your kingdom.  Why be sad and die?  Being happy is better than being sad.  You should be happy, not angry!" Shakuni explained that a king who lets his feelings control him isn't a good king.  He told Duryodhana to be friends with the Pandavas and be a happy king.

Duryodhana's brother, Dussasana, was also upset. Duryodhana hugged him and felt even sadder.  He listened to Shakuni and Karna, but he still felt terrible and decided to die anyway.  He said, "Leave me alone.  I want to die."  His friends were very sad and said they wouldn't leave him.


Duryodhana made a bed of grass, sat down, and decided to stop eating. He wanted to go to heaven.  

Meanwhile, some powerful demons heard what Duryodhana was doing.  They didn't want him to die, because he was their friend.  They performed a magic ritual, using special words and prayers, to bring Duryodhana to them!  A scary goddess appeared from the fire and quickly took Duryodhana away to the land of the demons!  The demons were very happy to see him.  They welcomed him warmly.
