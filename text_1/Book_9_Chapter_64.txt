King Dhritarashtra was worried.  He asked his advisor, Sanjaya, "My son, Duryodhana, is hurt very badly! What did he say?"

Sanjaya said, "King Dhritarashtra, I'll tell you. Duryodhana's legs were broken, and he was covered in dirt. He was very angry.  He looked around, sighing like a snake.  Tears streamed down his face, and he pounded the ground with his fists like a mad elephant! He shouted, 'I had such strong friends to help me: Bhishma, Karna, Shakuni, Drona, Ashwatthama, Shalya, and Kritavarma! Yet, I still lost! Even with my huge army, time beat me!  Bhima cheated! He hit me on the head with his foot while my legs were broken! That's not fair!  They also treated Bhishma and Drona badly!  How can anyone celebrate a victory like that?'"

Duryodhana kept talking. He said, "I was a great king! I gave lots of gifts, ruled the whole land, and fought bravely! I was the luckiest!  But now… now I am defeated unfairly! Tell my family: I lived a good life. I did everything a king should.  I’m dying like a soldier, but it wasn't a fair fight!"

He told Sanjaya to tell his friends Ashwatthama, Kritavarma, and Kripa, "Never trust the Pandavas! They cheat!"

Then, Duryodhana said, "Bhima killed me unfairly.  I’m joining Drona, Karna, Shalya, and all my other friends who died in battle. My poor family! My sister will be so sad. My father and mother will be heartbroken. My wife will be all alone.  But a wise man named Charvaka will avenge my death!"

Duryodhana said he died on a very special battlefield, and that meant he’d go to a good place.  Then, many soldiers cried and ran away.  The ground shook, and the sky turned dark.  Sanjaya's messengers told Ashwatthama what happened. They were all very sad.
