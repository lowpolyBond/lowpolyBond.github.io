King Nala loved to play dice.  He played and played, and he lost everything!  His wife, Damayanti, was very worried. She was brave and clever.

Damayanti saw her husband getting crazier and crazier with each lost game.  She was scared.  She told her friend, Vrihatsena, "Go get the king's advisors! Tell them everything Nala has lost!"

The advisors came, but Nala was too busy playing to listen!  Damayanti felt ashamed.  She went back to her room, still worried.

She told Vrihatsena, "Go get Nala's best friend, the charioteer Varshneya! This is very serious!"

Vrihatsena found Varshneya. Damayanti said, "Nala is in trouble.  He keeps losing, and he won't listen to anyone, not even me! Please help us."

She whispered a plan. "Take my children," she said. "Take Nala's best horses and carriage.  Take them to Kundina, to my family. Then you can decide what to do next."

Varshneya agreed. He talked to the other advisors.  They agreed to help Damayanti.  He took the children and the carriage to Kundina.  Then, with a sad heart, he went to find a new job.  He went to King Rituparna in Ayodhya and became his charioteer.
