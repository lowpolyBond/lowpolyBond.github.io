Once upon a time, in the land of Hastinapura, lived five brothers named Pandavas.  Their cousin, Duryodhana, was very jealous of them.

When Vidura, a wise and good man, returned to the palace after visiting the Pandavas, Duryodhana was furious! He felt sick with worry.  He called his friends, Karna, Dussasana, and Sakuni, for help.

"Vidura is helping the Pandavas!" Duryodhana cried.  "If they come back, I will be so sad I might even die!"

Sakuni, a clever but sneaky man, said, "Don't worry, Duryodhana! The Pandavas promised to live in the forest. They're honest, they won't break their promise."

Dussasana agreed with Sakuni. "You're right, uncle! We'll pretend to be happy about it, and we'll watch them closely."

Karna, a strong warrior, said, "If the Pandavas *do* return, we'll beat them at dice again!"

But then, Karna had a different idea!  He shouted, "Let's attack them now, while they're in the forest! Let's kill them!"

Duryodhana, Dussasana, and Sakuni loved this plan.  They all jumped into their chariots and sped off to attack the Pandavas.

But wait! A wise, holy man named Vyasa knew what was happening. He stopped Duryodhana and his friends.  He told them to go back.  He then went to talk to the king.
