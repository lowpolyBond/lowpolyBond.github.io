Once upon a time, a princess named Amva was very sad.  A powerful warrior named Bhishma had hurt her.  She went to a great hero, Rama, for help.

Amva cried, "Rama, please kill Bhishma!"

Rama was kind but strong. He said, "I only fight to protect people who study holy books.  But I will help you. Bhishma listens to me. Don't worry!"

Amva begged, "Please, Rama! Kill Bhishma! He's like a scary monster!"

Rama said, "Tell me what to do, and Bhishma will bow down to you!"

Amva insisted, "Rama, fight Bhishma!  Keep your promise!"

A wise man, a Rishi, told Rama, "You promised to protect people and fight anyone who hurts those who study holy books. Bhishma is very strong, but you must help Amva!"  He reminded Rama of a promise he'd made to always fight for those who are threatened and protect them.  Bhishma had defeated many warriors.

Rama remembered his promise. He said, "I'll try talking to Bhishma first. If he doesn't listen, I'll fight him. My arrows are magic; they always hit their target."

Rama, Amva, and the wise Rishi and his followers traveled to where Bhishma was.  They went to the Saraswati river and stayed there to rest.  The next morning, they went to face Bhishma, ready to help Amva.
