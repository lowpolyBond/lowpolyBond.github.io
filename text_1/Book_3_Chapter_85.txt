Once upon a time, a wise man named Pulastya told King Bhishma about many special places called tirthas.  These places were like magic spots!

"If you go to Samvedya in the evening and touch the water," Pulastya said, "you'll become very smart!"  He explained that Rama, a powerful hero, made a tirtha long ago.  Visiting another place called Lauhitya was like giving away lots and lots of gold!

Going to the Karatoya river and staying there for three nights without eating anything was as good as doing a big, important ceremony called a horse sacrifice.  Pulastya said this was a rule from the Creator himself!  Visiting where the Ganga river meets the ocean was even better â€“ ten times better than the horse sacrifice!

He then described many more tirthas. Bathing in Viraja made you shine like the moon and helped your whole family.  At the place where the Sona and Jyotirathi rivers met, you could offer water to the gods and it would be like doing another special ceremony.

Visiting many other places, like Rishabha, Kala, Pushpavati, and Vadarika, each brought special blessings, like long life, good fortune, and even helped your family!  Bathing at Champa and seeing Danda was like giving away a thousand cows!

Pulastya also talked about tirthas on mountains like Mahendra and Sree.  Bathing in the lakes and rivers there also brought amazing good luck and blessings. He even told Bhishma about a magical tirtha called Gokarna, where lots of amazing beings, like gods and magical creatures, worshipped the great god Isana.  Staying there for twelve nights cleaned your soul!


Pulastya described many more amazing places, each with its own special magic. Visiting the Gayatri tirtha, even the sound of people saying prayers there was beautiful.  Some other places gave people beauty, wonderful vehicles, and even memories of past lives!


Finally, Pulastya told Bhishma about the most special place of all: Prayaga, where the Ganga and Yamuna rivers meet. It was said to be the holiest place in the whole world!  Bathing there was better than doing any other ceremony, and even giving a tiny gift there grew a thousand times bigger.  Pulastya said it was best to die at Prayaga!

Another wise man, Narada, then talked to Bhishma. He said that Bhishma should visit all these special places.  Narada told Bhishma that other wise and holy people were waiting for him.

King Yudhishthira listened carefully and promised to share all this information with others, so everyone could learn about the magic of these amazing places.
