Once upon a time, there was a very good king named Sivi.  The gods wanted to see how kind he was.  So, Agni (the god of fire) turned into a pigeon, and Indra (the king of the gods) became a hawk.

The hawk chased the pigeon, and the scared pigeon flew to King Sivi for help. The pigeon landed on the king's lap!  A wise man told the king that this meant he was in danger, and he should give away something valuable to be safe.

The pigeon, who was really Agni in disguise, pleaded with the king. "Please don't let the hawk get me! I'm a holy man, not just a bird!"  The hawk then spoke, saying, "This is my food.  It's my turn to eat him."

King Sivi was very kind.  He didn't want to give up the pigeon.  He offered the hawk a big, delicious bull instead. But the hawk refused.  He only wanted the pigeon.

King Sivi thought hard.  He said, "I won't give up this pigeon.  I'll give you something else! I'll give you as much meat as the pigeon weighs!"

So, King Sivi took his sword. He carefully cut off a piece of his own leg and put it on a scale.  But the pigeon was heavier!  He cut off more and more until he was almost bare, but the pigeon still weighed more!  Finally, he climbed onto the scale himself!

The hawk, who was really Indra, saw how good and selfless King Sivi was.  He disappeared!  The pigeon turned back into Agni.

Agni praised King Sivi.  He said, "You're a wonderful king!  Your wounds will heal and turn into beautiful golden marks. You will have a famous son, and you will rule your kingdom for a very long time."  King Sivi was a very brave and kind king, and everyone loved him.
