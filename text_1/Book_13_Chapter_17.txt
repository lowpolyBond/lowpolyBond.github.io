Once upon a time, in the land of the Mahabharata, a wise man named Vasudeva told King Yudhishthira a very special story.  He said, "A holy man named Upamanyu knew some amazing names of a powerful god, Mahadeva."

Upamanyu explained, "These aren't just any names.  Some came from the gods, some from other holy people, and some are even from ancient sacred books!  They're super powerful and can help anyone who says them with a good heart."

He continued, "Mahadeva is the greatest god. He's super old, and nobody can really understand how powerful he is, not even the other gods! But because of my love for him, I'll share a few of his names with you."

Upamanyu then began to list Mahadeva's names.  He said Mahadeva is:

* **Eternal:**  He's always been here.
* **The Creator:** He made everything!
* **The Destroyer:**  He brings things to an end.
* **The Protector:** He keeps everyone safe.
* **The Giver of Boons:** He grants wishes.
* **The One with Many Forms:** He can look like anything!

Upamanyu shared many more names, describing Mahadeva's amazing powers and beautiful forms. He explained that these names were like the purest part of something – like taking only the sweetest honey from the flowers or the best gold from a mountain.  Saying these names could wash away all bad things.

He warned, "Only share these names with someone who truly believes and has a good heart.  Anyone who is mean to Mahadeva will face bad things."

Upamanyu said these names were very special, like a magic spell, and could help even at the very end of someone's life.  He said Brahma, the greatest god of all, had given these names a very important place.

Then, Upamanyu explained how these names had traveled from Brahma to heaven, down to Earth, and finally to him.  They were so powerful, they could make your heart pure and clean.

Finally, he said, "These names are the best way to understand and connect with Mahadeva. They’re like the best prayer."

Krishna, another important person in the story, added, "Anyone who says these names with a good heart, and is good themselves, will be protected from bad things!"


This story shows how powerful and important these special names of Mahadeva are.  They are a gift that can bring good things to those who use them wisely.
