Once upon a time, a good king named Yudhishthira asked a wise old man, Bhishma, a very tricky question.  "Bhishma," he said, "how can someone always be good?  Is it always best to tell the truth, or are there times when it's okay to tell a little white lie?"

Bhishma smiled. "Telling the truth is always the best," he said, "but sometimes, it's tricky.  Imagine a situation where telling the truth would cause harm, and a little lie would help someone.  In that case, a small lie to help someone is better than hurting them with the truth."

Bhishma told Yudhishthira stories.  He told of a hunter who killed a dangerous blind beast to save others. He also told of an owl who did something not quite right but ended up saving many lives. These stories showed that being good isn't always easy.  It's about doing what's right, even if it's hard to know what is right.

"Being good," Bhishma explained, "means helping others and not hurting them. It means making the world a better place.  Sometimes, the rules aren't clear.  The holy books don't always have all the answers."

Bhishma gave more examples. "If someone asks you where someone is so they can steal their things, you don't have to answer. Keeping quiet is better than helping a bad person! If you need to protect yourself or your family, it’s ok to say something that isn’t completely true.  But you should *never* lie to hurt someone."

He also said that people who are always greedy and selfish are like crows and vultures. They only care about themselves, and they'll do anything for money.  It's okay to trick someone who is constantly trying to hurt others.  We should always be kind and honest, but sometimes, to protect ourselves and others, we need to be clever!  The most important thing is to be kind and to try to do the right thing.
