Sanjaya said, "Karna, the mighty warrior, spoke bravely.  But Krishna, a clever and kind warrior, smiled and said, 'Karna, I offer you the whole world!  Why fight?  The Pandavas will win.'

Krishna explained, "Look at Arjuna's amazing flag! It's so tall and bright, like a giant flame!  It has magical creatures showing that Arjuna will win!  It's so magnificent, nothing can stop it!

Imagine seeing Arjuna in battle!  He'll be on his chariot, pulled by white horses, with Krishna driving.  He'll use powerful weapons, and his bow will sound like thunder! It will be an amazing sight.

See Yudhishthira, the brave leader, shining like the sun, protecting his army and defeating his enemies!

Imagine Bhima, strong and fierce, like a powerful elephant, after defeating his enemies!

Arjuna will defeat all of Duryodhana's best warriors: Drona, Bhishma, Kripa, and Jayadratha!

And Nakula and Sahadeva, the twins, will fight like angry elephants, smashing the enemy army!

Karna, go tell Drona, Bhishma, and Kripa that now is a good time to fight. The weather is perfect, and the roads are good. Let's start the battle seven days from now, on the new moon. That's a lucky day!

Tell all the kings fighting for Duryodhana that they will be rewarded in the afterlife, even though they may die fighting.  The Pandavas' victory is certain."
