Once upon a time, after a long time, wise King Yudhishthira secretly talked to his brave brother Arjuna.  He said, "Arjuna,  Bhishma, Drona, Kripa, and Karna are the greatest warriors.  They know all the best fighting tricks.  Duryodhana, our enemy, is very nice to them.  He's given them lots of gifts. Because of this, they will fight for him.  Duryodhana controls everything â€“ the land, the towns, even the seas! We need your help, Arjuna. You are our only hope."

Yudhishthira then taught Arjuna a secret skill. "This skill will show you everything in the world," he said.  "You must be very strong and brave. Go north, and don't stop for anyone.  Indra, the king of the gods, has all the best weapons.  Go to him and he will give them to you."

Arjuna, strong and ready for anything, took his special bow, Gandiva, and left.  Before he went, everyone wished him good luck.  His best friend Krishna said, "Arjuna, I'm sad to see you go.  Duryodhana was mean to me, but I'm even sadder to lose you. We all depend on you!"  Krishna gave Arjuna many blessings.

Arjuna traveled far and fast. He climbed many mountains. Finally, he reached a magical place.  A voice said, "Stop!"  Arjuna looked around and saw a shining man.  It was Indra, disguised as a holy man.

Indra told Arjuna, "You don't need weapons here. This is a peaceful place."  But Arjuna still wanted the weapons.  He explained, "I need to fight for my family! I must defeat Duryodhana!"

Indra smiled and said, "Okay, but first, you must see Lord Shiva, the greatest god. After that, I will give you all the weapons."  Then, Indra disappeared.  Arjuna stayed there and practiced his skills to get ready to meet Lord Shiva.
