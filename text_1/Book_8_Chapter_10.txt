After the great warrior Drona died, the Kaurava army ran away.  Arjuna and his brothers stayed.  Duryodhana, the Kaurava prince, saw his army fleeing and bravely rallied them.  He fought the Pandavas for a long time, but as evening came, he called his soldiers back to camp.

That night, the Kaurava leaders met.  Duryodhana asked, "What should we do now?"

Everyone wanted to fight again.  Ashwatthama, Drona's son, spoke.  "We lost great warriors," he said, "but we can still win! We need a new leader â€“ Karna! He is strong and brave. He can defeat the Pandavas!"

Duryodhana was excited. He remembered how Bhishma and Drona had been kind to the Pandavas. He said to Karna, "Bhishma and Drona are gone. You are stronger than them! Be our leader!  Fight like a great hero and defeat the Pandavas!"

Karna agreed.  "I will be your General," he said, "and I will defeat the Pandavas."

Duryodhana and the other kings were happy. They gave Karna a grand ceremony to make him the new leader.  Brahmins blessed him, saying, "Defeat Arjuna and Krishna!  No one can stand against you!"

Karna, now the leader, was proud and powerful. He prepared his army, ready to fight again at sunrise.  He felt like a great hero, ready to win the war!
