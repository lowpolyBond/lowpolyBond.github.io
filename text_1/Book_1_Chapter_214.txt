Once upon a time, two giant brothers, super strong Asuras, ruled the whole world!  They were so powerful, nobody could beat them. They had all the treasure, and lived like kings, having parties all the time. They ate delicious food, wore fancy clothes, and danced with beautiful women.

One day, they went to a pretty meadow in the Vindhya mountains for a big party.  While they were enjoying themselves, a beautiful girl named Tilottama walked by. She was so stunning that the brothers forgot all about their party!  They both wanted to marry her.

This made them very angry! They argued and fought.  They were so angry that they forgot they were brothers. They fought with their big clubs and hurt each other really badly. They were so hurt that they fell down and died.

The other Asuras and the women ran away, scared.  Then, a very important god, Brahma, came to see what happened.  He was very happy with Tilottama and gave her a special gift â€“ a magical place to live!  Brahma fixed everything and made sure the world was safe again.

Narada, a wise man, told the Pandava brothers (five brothers from another story) about the Asuras.  He warned them, "Don't fight over one woman like the Asuras did!"

The Pandava brothers were smart.  They decided to share their wife, Draupadi, fairly. They made a rule: if one brother was with Draupadi, the other brothers had to go live in the forest for twelve years! This way, they never fought.  And that's how the wise Pandavas avoided a big fight!
