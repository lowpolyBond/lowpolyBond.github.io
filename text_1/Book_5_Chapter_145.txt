Once upon a time, a woman named Kunti met a brave warrior named Karna.  Karna said, "I'm Karna, son of Radha and Adhiratha. What can I do for you?"

Kunti had a secret. She told Karna, "You're not really Radha and Adhiratha's son!  I'm your mother, Kunti!  The sun god, Surya, is your real father. You were born in a palace, strong and shining!"

Kunti explained that Karna had brothers, the Pandavas.  He didn't know them, and was helping their enemies, the Kauravas. Kunti said, "It's important to honor your family. Your brothers, the Pandavas, lost their kingdom unfairly. Help them get it back!"

She told Karna, "Imagine you and your brothers, Arjuna especially, together!  You'd be as strong as the gods! Everyone would admire you.  Forget being called 'Suta's son.' You are a Partha, a member of our great family!"

Kunti wanted Karna to join his brothers.  Together, she said, they could do amazing things.  She wanted him to be proud of who he really was.
