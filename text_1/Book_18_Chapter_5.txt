Once upon a time, after a big battle, a prince named Janamejaya asked a wise storyteller, Sauti, about what happened to all the heroes.  He wanted to know where they went after they died.  He mentioned many important people: Bhishma, Drona, King Dhritarashtra, and many others.  He wanted to know if they went to heaven forever.

Sauti said he'd ask another wise man, Vaishampayana, who knew all the answers. Vaishampayana said it wasn't easy to say exactly what happened to everyone.  But he knew because he had heard from the wisest man of all, Vyasa.

Vaishampayana then told Janamejaya a magical story:

* Strong Bhishma became one of the Vasus, a group of powerful gods.
* Drona joined another god, Brihaspati.
* Many kings and heroes, like Virata and Drupada, became gods too!
* Karna, a brave warrior, went to the sun god, Surya.
* Shakuni went to a part of the earth called Dwapara.
* The sons of Dhritarashtra became fierce Rakshasas (powerful beings).
* The Pandava brothers, except for one, also became gods.
* The kind Balarama went to a special place under the earth.
* Even Krishna, who was a very special god, went back to being a part of the great god Narayana.
* Many women who were married to Krishna became beautiful Apsaras in heaven.
* Ghatotkaca and other heroes who fought bravely went to be with different gods or spirits.

Vaishampayana explained that some heroes went to the homes of different gods, like Indra or Kuvera.  He told Janamejaya about all the Kurus and Pandavas.

After hearing this amazing story, Janamejaya was very happy. The storytellers finished their work and everyone celebrated.

Vaishampayana then told Janamejaya that this whole story was called the Mahabharata. He said that listening to the Mahabharata washed away sins. Reading it helped people be good and get to heaven. He explained that this great story was told to different beings – gods, ancestors, and humans – by different storytellers.

Finally, Vaishampayana said that the Mahabharata taught many important lessons about being good, kind, and brave, and following the path of righteousness.  He said that even listening to a little bit of this story could help people be better.  It is a story of good vs. evil, bravery, and wisdom.  And by listening to it, everyone can learn something.
