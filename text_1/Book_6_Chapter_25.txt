Once upon a time, on a big battlefield called Kurukshetra, two armies stood ready to fight.  One army was led by the Pandavas, and the other by the Kauravas, who were brothers.  King Dhritarashtra, who was blind, asked his advisor Sanjaya to tell him what was happening.

Sanjaya described the Pandavas’ army.  It was HUGE!  There were many brave warriors like Bhima and Arjuna, and many other strong fighters.

Then, Duryodhana, the leader of the Kauravas, spoke to his teacher Drona.  He pointed out all the strong Pandava warriors.  Then he boasted about his own army.  He said that his army, led by the great Bhishma, was also very powerful, with many brave warriors like Karna and Kripa.  Everyone blew their horns and made a lot of noise!  It was a scary and exciting sound!

Arjuna, a great warrior of the Pandavas, asked his friend Krishna to stop the chariot between the two armies. Arjuna wanted to see the people he would be fighting.  He saw his family members – his uncles, cousins, grandfathers, and friends – on both sides!

Arjuna was very sad.  He didn't want to fight.  His body shook, his hands trembled, and he dropped his bow and arrow. He said, "Krishna, how can I fight my own family? I don't want to kill them, even for the whole world!  What good is winning if I have to kill my loved ones?  This will bring bad luck and sadness to our families, and our ancestors will be sad too."

Arjuna felt terrible. He was so upset that he refused to fight. He put down his bow and arrow, too heartbroken to continue.
