Once upon a time, during a big battle, a king named Jayadratha fought the Pandavas.  He was a super strong warrior!

He rode a fast chariot pulled by powerful horses.  His chariot was beautiful, like a shiny palace in the sky. His flag had a silver boar on it. He was very impressive, like the moon!

Jayadratha shot lots and lots of arrows. He hit many Pandava warriors: Satyaki, Bhima, Dhrishtadyumna, Drupada, and Sikhandin.  He even hit the five sons of Draupadi and Yudhishthira!  He was amazing, shooting arrows everywhere!

Yudhishthira was brave. He broke Jayadratha's bow with one arrow!  But Jayadratha quickly grabbed a new bow and kept shooting!

Bhima was angry. He smashed Jayadratha's bow, flag, and umbrella with three giant arrows!  But Jayadratha was still strong! He broke Bhima's bow, flag, and even killed his horses!

Bhima jumped off his broken chariot onto Satyaki's chariot. It was super impressive, like a lion leaping onto a mountain! The king's army cheered wildly.  They were so amazed by how well Jayadratha fought!

Jayadratha fought all the Pandava warriors at once, all by himself! He was so good, he stopped the Pandavas and their friends (the Matsyas, Panchalas, and Kaikeyas) from getting close to him.  He was so strong because he had a magic power!  He was like an amazing wall, stopping everyone!
