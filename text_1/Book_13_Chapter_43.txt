Once upon a time, a wise teacher named Devasarman sent his student, Vipula, on a journey through a big forest.  When Vipula came back, Devasarman asked, "What did you see, Vipula?"

Vipula was confused. He said, "Teacher, I saw two people first – who were they?  Then I saw six others playing a game – who were they too? They all seemed to know me!"

Devasarman smiled. "The first two were Day and Night," he explained. "They go round and round, never stopping. They saw what you did.  The six others playing were the six Seasons of the year – spring, summer, autumn, winter, and two more. They saw it too!"

Vipula gasped. He had kept a secret, and now he understood.  He had done something he hadn't told his teacher.

Devasarman continued, "When you do something wrong, even in secret, Day, Night, and the Seasons always see it. You thought nobody knew, but they did!  But, Vipula, what you did wasn't really bad. You protected my wife, Ruchi, even though she could be tricky.  That was a good thing! I'm very proud of you."

Devasarman, his wife, and Vipula then went to a happy place in the sky.

Later, a very old, wise man told this story to King Bhishma, who is telling it to you now.  The story teaches us that women need to be protected, but they can be tricky sometimes.  Being kind and doing what's right is always the best way.  Only one man, Vipula, learned how to do this!  It's a very hard thing to do.  Remember that even when nobody is watching, Day, Night, and the Seasons always see what you do!
