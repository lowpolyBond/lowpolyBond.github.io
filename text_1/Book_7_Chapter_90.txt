Sanjaya, the storyteller, said, "Arjuna, the great warrior, fought bravely.  He defeated many soldiers. He wanted to fight Jayadratha, the king of Sindhu.  Arjuna went to see Drona, his teacher, who was guarding the army.

Arjuna bowed to Drona.  He said, "My teacher, please bless me! I need your help to get through the army. You're like my father, or like King Yudhishthira, or even like Krishna!  Please help me fight Jayadratha."

Drona smiled. He said, "Arjuna, you can't defeat Jayadratha without defeating me first!"  Then Drona shot many arrows at Arjuna, his chariot, his horses, and his driver.

Arjuna fought back! He shot even more arrows.  He pierced Drona with nine arrows!  Drona fought back hard, shooting arrows at Arjuna and Krishna.  He even broke Arjuna's bowstring!

But Arjuna was strong! He got a new bow and shot hundreds and thousands of arrows!  Many soldiers, horses, and elephants fell.  It was a huge battle! Drona fought back, shooting many arrows at Arjuna. Arjuna even felt weak for a moment, but he fought on!

Krishna, Arjuna's friend, said, "Arjuna, we need to go now! We have a more important task."  Arjuna agreed.

They went past Drona, who shouted, "Where are you going, Arjuna? You always fight until you win!"

Arjuna answered, "Teacher, you're my teacher, not my enemy. I'm your student, like your son. Nobody can beat you!"

Arjuna went on to find Jayadratha. Many other soldiers tried to stop him â€“ Yudhamanyu, Uttamaujas, Jaya, Kritavarman, and many, many more.  They were led by Drona. It was a huge, scary battle!  Arjuna was very angry, and he was ready to fight them all!"
