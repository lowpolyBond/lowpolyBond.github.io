Abhimanyu, Arjuna's son, was a super-strong warrior!  He was fighting against a huge army.  Dhritarashtra, the king, asked Sanjaya, his advisor, "How did my best warriors do against Abhimanyu?"

Sanjaya said, "King, Abhimanyu was amazing! He was bravely fighting his way through the enemy's army, even with Arjuna's friend helping him!"

Abhimanyu was so fast!  He fought Salya's brother.  Zoom!  With his arrows, he sliced the brother's chariot to pieces – the wheels, the banner, everything! The brother fell to the ground like a giant tree in a storm.  His soldiers were scared and ran away. Everyone cheered, "Well done, Abhimanyu!"

Then, even more soldiers attacked Abhimanyu! They came on chariots, horses, elephants, and on foot.  They yelled and shouted, "You can't escape!"

Abhimanyu just smiled.  He used his special arrows, the ones he learned from his uncle Krishna and his father Arjuna.  He was so fast, you couldn't even see him move! His bow went *whizz*, *bang* – like a big storm! He fought bravely, but gently at first, then he got stronger and stronger, like the sun getting hotter.

He shot thousands of arrows, covering the enemy's army!  The enemy was so scared they ran away!  Everyone was amazed by how bravely Abhimanyu fought.
