King Dhritarashtra was worried.  He asked Sanjaya, his messenger, about the big battle.  "Sanjaya," he said, "our commander, Sweta, was killed! What happened then?  Did the Pandavas and their friends fight back?" Dhritarashtra wasn't happy about the war.  He knew it was wrong.  Even his son, Duryodhana, had been scared of the Pandavas and had asked for their help once!  But Duryodhana, with his bad friends Karna and Suvala's son, always wanted to fight.  Dhritarashtra, Gandhari (his wife), Vidura, and many others tried to stop Duryodhana, but he wouldn't listen. Dhritarashtra was especially worried about Arjuna, the Pandava warrior. Arjuna was so strong and brave!

Sanjaya told Dhritarashtra what happened after Sweta died.  Bhishma, a great warrior on Dhritarashtra's side, had killed Sweta.  Then, Sankha, another warrior, got very angry. He wanted to fight Bhishma! But Bhishma was too powerful.  Arjuna saw Sankha was in trouble, so he rushed to help.  A huge fight started between Arjuna and Bhishma! It was a terrible battle.  Bhishma was so strong that he made the Pandavas' army shake like a boat in a storm. He shot many arrows and defeated many soldiers. The Pandavas' army was scared and ran away.  When the sun went down, the Pandavas stopped fighting and went to rest.  Dhritarashtra was still very worried.
