Once upon a time, a very strong and handsome man came to King Virata's palace.  He walked like a playful lion! He carried a cooking spoon and ladle, but also a shiny black sword!  He looked so bright and strong, like the sun!  He was dressed in black, and was as strong as a mountain!

King Virata saw him and said, "Wow! Who is this amazing man? He's so strong and handsome!  Is he a king?  Or even a god?"  He asked his helpers to find out who the stranger was.

The helpers found out that the strong man was Bhima, a brother of the Pandava princes. Bhima went to King Virata and said, "Your Majesty, I'm a cook named Vallava. I'm a great cook, please hire me!"

King Virata said, "Vallava, you don't look like a cook! You look like a powerful king!"

Bhima smiled and said, "I am your cook, Your Majesty. I can cook delicious food, and I'm also a super strong wrestler! I can even fight lions and elephants! I'll protect you!"

King Virata was amazed. He said, "You can do whatever you like! I'll grant you any wish!  But this job seems too small for you, you deserve much more! However, be my head cook!"

So Bhima became the head cook. Nobody knew he was a powerful prince, and he secretly lived in the kitchen.
