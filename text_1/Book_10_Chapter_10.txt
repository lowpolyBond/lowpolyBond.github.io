One morning, Yudhishthira, the king, woke up to terrible news.  His chariot driver told him, "King, a terrible thing happened last night!  Kritavarma, Kripa, and Ashvatthama attacked our camp while everyone was asleep. They killed many soldiers, elephants, and horses.  They killed Draupadi's sons and all King Drupada's children! I'm the only one who escaped!"

Yudhishthira was heartbroken. He fell to the ground, very sad. His brothers, Bhima, Arjuna, and Nakula and Sahadeva, rushed to comfort him.  Yudhishthira cried, "We won the war, but now we've lost so much!  We killed many people, and now our own sons and friends are dead.  It feels like our victory is a defeat!"

He remembered how brave his sons were. They were like lions in battle, even facing fierce warriors like Karna! They fought so hard, but they were killed because they were not careful enough. Yudhishthira said, "Carelessness is the worst enemy!  It takes away everything â€“ happiness, friends, and even life." He thought of his sons, who fought so bravely through a terrible war, only to die when they were not careful enough.

He was especially worried about Draupadi.  She had lost her sons and brothers. He knew she would be very sad.  He sent Nakula to bring her to him.

Yudhishthira went to the battlefield.  He saw his sons and his friends, all dead and covered in blood. He cried even more. He was so, so sad.  The victory felt like a terrible loss.
