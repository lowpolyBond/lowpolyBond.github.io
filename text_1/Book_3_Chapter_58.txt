Once upon a time, after Damayanti, Bhima's daughter, chose a prince named Nala to be her husband, some important gods were going home.  They bumped into Kali, a naughty god, and Dwapara, another god.

Indra, the king of the gods, asked Kali, "Where are you going?"

Kali grumbled, "I'm going to Damayanti's wedding! I want to marry her!"

Indra chuckled, "Oh, but it's already over!  Damayanti already picked Nala."

Kali was furious!  He shouted, "She chose a regular person?  That's not fair!  She should be punished!"

But the other gods said, "No!  Nala is a wonderful king! He's kind, honest, and smart. He's a great person!  Anyone would want to marry him.  You're being silly, Kali!"

They told Kali that cursing Nala would be like cursing himself.  Then, the gods went back to heaven.

Kali was still angry.  He told Dwapara, "I can't help it! I'm going to make Nala lose everything!  I'll make him lose his kingdom and his wife! I'll use a pair of dice to do it!"  And so, with Dwapara's help, Kali's mean plan began.
