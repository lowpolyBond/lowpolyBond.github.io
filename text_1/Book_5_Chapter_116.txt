King Haryyaswa saw a beautiful girl named Madhavi.  She was so pretty, everyone agreed she was amazing!  A wise man named Narada told the king, "This girl is perfect! She'll have lots of children, maybe even a king!"

The king wanted to marry Madhavi.  Her teacher, Galava, said, "I'll let you marry her if you give me 800 special white horses, each with one black ear."

King Haryyaswa only had 200 of those horses.  He was sad, but he really wanted to marry Madhavi. He asked Galava if he could marry her with just the 200 horses.

Madhavi was clever! She said, "I have a magic power. After each baby, I become young again!  The king can marry me, and Galava can get the rest of the horses from other kings later."

Galava agreed.  King Haryyaswa married Madhavi.  They had a wonderful son named Vasumanas. He grew up to be a very rich and kind king.

After a while, Galava returned to King Haryyaswa.  He said, "You have a great son! It's time to go and ask another king for horses."

King Haryyaswa, who was a good and honest man, remembered he still owed Galava 600 horses. He gave Madhavi back to Galava.  Even though she was now a queen, she happily went with Galava to get the rest of the horses from another king.  She was happy to help her teacher.  And that's how Galava got his horses!
