King Dhritarashtra heard that Krishna, the powerful warrior, was coming.  He was very excited!  Everyone was talking about it.  Dhritarashtra told his son Duryodhana and his advisors, "Krishna is incredibly strong and wise. We need to honor him! He's like a god!  If we make him happy, he'll help us. We must welcome him properly."

Bhishma and the others agreed.  Duryodhana immediately started planning. He ordered beautiful pavilions to be built along the road. These pavilions were amazing! They were filled with sparkling jewels, comfy chairs, pretty girls, delicious food, sweet-smelling flowers, and all sorts of wonderful things.  Duryodhana even built a super special pavilion at Vrikasthala for Krishna.

Duryodhana told his father, "It's all ready, Father! We've done everything to please Krishna!"  But guess what? When Krishna arrived, he didn't even look at all the fancy pavilions and beautiful things! He just went straight to the city.
