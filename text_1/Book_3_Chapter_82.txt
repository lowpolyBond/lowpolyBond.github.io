Long ago, in the land of Bharat, a great warrior named Bhishma met a powerful sage named Pulastya.  Pulastya was very happy with Bhishma's kindness and good behavior.  "Bhishma," he said, "I'm pleased with you! Ask me anything, and I will grant it!"

Bhishma was already very happy to have met such a wise sage.  But he had questions.  He wanted to know about holy places called tirthas.  "Wise Pulastya," Bhishma asked, "what makes these tirthas special?  What good things happen to people who visit them?"

Pulastya smiled. "Bhishma," he said, "people who are kind, peaceful, and honest get the most blessings from tirthas.  They must control their thoughts and actions.  They shouldn't be greedy or boastful."

He explained that visiting a tirtha was like a special prayer.  It was better than giving expensive gifts.  He talked about a very special tirtha called Pushkara.  "Pushkara is a super special place!" Pulastya exclaimed. "Gods and goddesses visit Pushkara all the time.  Even thinking about Pushkara can make you a better person!"

Pulastya told Bhishma about many other important tirthas. He described Jamvu-marga, Tandulikasrama, and many others.  He explained that visiting each tirtha brought special blessings.  Some were as good as performing huge ceremonies, like giving away many cows or horses. Others brought happiness, good luck, and a better life.   He even talked about a place where coins with lotus flowers were found!  Visiting all of these holy places would be a grand adventure!

Pulastya told Bhishma that some places were hard to reach.  Sometimes, the journey was challenging. But the blessings received would be worth all the effort.  "Each place has its own special magic, Bhishma," Pulastya said, "and each one can help you become a better person and bring you closer to the gods."
