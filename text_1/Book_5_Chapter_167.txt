King Bhishma was talking to the king. He was telling him about all the strong warriors who would fight for him.

"Look," said Bhishma, "Sudhakshina from Kamvoja is super strong! He's like a powerful chariot all by himself. He really wants to help you win, so he'll fight hard.  He'll be as strong as the god Indra!"

"And the Kamvoja army?  They'll be everywhere, like a swarm of locusts!"

Then there's Nila from Mahishmati.  He wears shiny blue armor.  He's another great warrior, and his army will really hurt your enemies!  He had a little fight with Sahadeva once, but he'll fight hard for you now.

Vinda and Anuvinda from Avanti are awesome warriors too! They’re like two elephants leading their herd into battle. They'll fight with clubs, spears, swords, and arrows! They'll be as scary as the god of death, Yama!

The five brothers from Trigarta are also amazing warriors! They fought against the Pandavas before. They're like giant sea monsters crashing through waves! They'll really shake up the Pandava army!  They remember when Bhima's brother fought them, and they want revenge!

Your son Lakshmana and Dussasana's son are brave warriors, too. They’re young and strong, and they will never give up!

Dandadhara is another strong warrior.  He'll fight hard with his soldiers.

King Vrihadvala from Kosala is also super strong! He'll fight really hard for you and make his friends happy.

And finally, there's Kripa! He’s a super-duper great warrior, the best of the best! He’s not afraid of anything, not even death!  He’s as strong as the god Kartikeya! He'll be like a big fire, burning through all your enemies!"
