King Dhritarashtra was worried.  He was the father of the Kauravas, who were fighting against the Pandavas.  He said, "Arjuna, the Pandava warrior, is unbeatable! He never lies.  He has the best warrior on his side.  Arjuna's bow, the Gandiva, is so powerful, no one can stand against him."

Dhritarashtra knew Arjuna was amazing.  He explained, "Even our best warriors, Drona and Karna, might not win.  Karna is kind but careless, and Drona is old and loves Arjuna like a son.  Arjuna is strong and skillful.  He always wins!  He’s won amazing battles before.  He even defeated the gods a long time ago!"

Dhritarashtra was very scared. He continued, "Arjuna has Krishna, the best charioteer, driving his chariot.  Together, they're unstoppable! We don’t have anything like that.  Arjuna’s arrows are like a burning fire, destroying everything!  I see my army running away in fear!  It’s like a huge fire spreading, burning everything in its path."

Dhritarashtra was very sad.  He said, "Arjuna’s anger is terrible.  He’s angry at my sons.  I don’t know how to stop him.  Bad things keep happening.  It looks like we are going to lose the war."
