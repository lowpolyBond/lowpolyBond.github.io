After a good night's sleep, Yudhishthira woke up. He and his brothers did their morning chores. Then he asked Arjuna, his brave brother, "Arjuna, show me the amazing weapons the gods gave you!"

Arjuna, so strong and pure, agreed. He sat on his special chariot. It had a mountain for a pole, and bamboo for the wheels.  He shone brightly in his godly armor! He picked up his bow, Gandiva, and his magical conch shell. He showed Yudhishthira his powerful weapons, one by one.

BOOM!  The earth shook!  Trees swayed. Rivers raged. Rocks cracked! The sun hid.  The fire went out. Even the holy words of the Vedas disappeared! Creatures from deep underground popped up, scared and shaking. They begged Arjuna to stop!

Suddenly, amazing things happened!  Wise holy men, magical beings, and gods appeared!  Even the great god Shiva came! The wind god, Vayu, showered flowers everywhere.  Singing magical beings danced.

Then, Narada, a wise messenger from the gods, arrived.  "Arjuna," he said, "don't use these weapons unless you really, really have to! Using them without a good reason is very bad. Keep them safe, and they will bring you good luck. But if you misuse them, they could destroy the whole world!"

After Narada spoke, all the gods and magical beings went away.  The Pandavas, happy and safe, went back to their forest home, with their friend Krishna.
