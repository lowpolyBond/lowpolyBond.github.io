Once upon a time, there was a brave crane named Rajadharman.  He was a very good friend to a Rakshasa king named Virupaksha.  Sadly, Rajadharman was killed by a man named Gautama.

Virupaksha was very sad. He built a beautiful funeral pyre for his friend. He decorated it with jewels, perfumes, and fancy clothes.  Then, he lit the pyre.

Suddenly, a magical cow, Surabhi, appeared in the sky!  Milk spilled from her mouth onto the fire.  Miraculously, Rajadharman came back to life!

King Indra, the king of the gods, came down to see what happened. He explained that a long time ago, Rajadharman had made the great god Brahma angry. Brahma had cursed him, saying he wouldn't die easily.  The milk from Surabhi was like magic, breaking the curse!

Rajadharman was so happy to be alive. He asked Indra to bring Gautama back to life too.  Indra sprinkled some magical nectar, and Gautama lived again!

Rajadharman and Gautama were friends again.  Rajadharman went back to his home. Gautama, sadly, wasn't a very good friend. He did bad things and was punished by the gods.

Bhishma, a wise old man, told this story to Yudhishthira. Bhishma said it showed how important it is to be a good friend.  He said ungrateful friends are bad and should be avoided.  Good friends help each other, share good times, and support each other through hard times.  Being a good friend is very important!  Yudhishthira was very happy to hear this important lesson.
