Once upon a time, a wise teacher told Arjuna, a brave warrior, a very important secret. He said, "Arjuna, your body is like a field.  Inside that field is something special – your true self."

The teacher explained that the field (body) and the true self are connected.  Understanding this connection is very, very important. He said the field is made of many things: your senses (like sight, hearing, smell), your mind, your feelings (like happiness and sadness), and even your thoughts.  All these things are part of the field.


To have a good field, you need good things to grow. These are things like being kind, helpful, honest, and brave.  Bad things, like being mean or selfish, hurt the field.

The true self is different! It's like a bright light inside you.  It's always there, even when you're feeling sad or happy. It's everywhere at once, but also inside you.  It's the source of all light and everything around you. It’s not affected by the field (your body) and the things in it.

The teacher said that knowing the difference between the field and the true self is like unlocking a great secret – it leads to happiness and peace.  Seeing that everyone has this same inner light, you understand that everyone is connected and you will stop hurting yourself or others.

He said that our actions are mostly driven by the field – our nature.  The true self just watches.  If you understand that, you'll be free from worry and pain.  By seeing everything connected to that one inner light, you'll understand the greatest truth of all.

Like the sun lights up the whole world, your true self lights up your whole life. Once you understand this, you'll understand what really matters and you will never be truly hurt again.
