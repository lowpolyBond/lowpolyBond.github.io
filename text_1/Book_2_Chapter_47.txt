The sun came up, but Rama was gone!  The people of the city woke up and couldn't find him.  They were so sad.  Tears ran down their faces as they searched everywhere.  Where had he gone?

"Oh, no!" they cried. "We slept too long!  We'll never see Rama's big, bright eyes again!  He was so kind to us, like a father, and now he's left us!"

Some wanted to die. "Let's build a fire and end it all," they sobbed.  "What will we tell everyone? How can we face them without Rama?  The city will be so heartbroken – the women, the children, the old people…  We left our homes to follow him, and now we have nothing!"

They were like lost cows, crying and searching. They followed Rama's chariot tracks, but they lost them.  "Oh, what will we do?" they wailed.  With heavy hearts, they went back home to Ayodhya.

Ayodhya felt empty without Rama.  It wasn't beautiful anymore.  It was like a dry riverbed, all empty and sad. The people couldn't even recognize their own family members.  Their hearts felt broken.  The city was like a night sky without a moon, or an ocean without water.  It was so sad and still. They went back to their houses, feeling lost and lonely.
