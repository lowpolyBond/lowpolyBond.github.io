Once upon a time, after a long night, some holy men, called Brahmins, came to see the Pandava brothers.  The Pandavas, including Yudhishthira, their kind king, were sad. They had lost their kingdom and everything they owned.  They were going to live in a scary forest, eating only fruits, roots, and whatever animals they could catch.

"These good Brahmins will suffer greatly in the forest," worried Yudhishthira. "It's full of dangerous animals and snakes!  Please, go back!"

But the Brahmins said, "We're going with you, King! We'll help you.  We’ll pray and keep you safe."

Yudhishthira was still worried.  His brothers were heartbroken, and Draupadi, his wife, was very upset. He felt terrible that they had to work so hard just to survive.

The Brahmins reassured him, "Don't worry about us, King. We'll take care of ourselves. We'll be happy to talk with you and keep you company."

Yudhishthira felt ashamed.  He felt he wasn’t worthy of their kindness. Then a wise Brahmin named Saunaka spoke.

"King," Saunaka said, "sadness comes from wanting things. Wise people don’t let their wants control them.  Your worries come from caring too much about things that don't really matter.  Things like wealth and possessions. They are like the heat of a fire, making the water around it boil. The heat of your sadness is hurting you."

Saunaka explained that true happiness comes from being content.  He said that wanting things only brings more problems.  Riches don’t bring true happiness. They just lead to more worries, like fearing thieves or losing your wealth.

Yudhishthira said, "But Brahmin, I only want enough wealth to help you, and to care for those who follow me."

Saunaka nodded. "The world is full of tricky things.  People may think they're doing good, but really, they are just doing what feels good to them.  True happiness comes from doing what is right, even if it’s hard. Focus on helping others, being kind, and living a good life."  

He explained that true happiness doesn't come from wealth or power, but from doing good deeds, like helping others, being truthful, and controlling your desires.

Saunaka told Yudhishthira to focus on kindness, helping others, and being content with what he has.  He said that true happiness comes from within, not from material things.  Then the wise Brahmin taught Yudhishthira how to find peace and happiness in the midst of their troubles. And so, the Pandavas and the Brahmins went into the forest together.
