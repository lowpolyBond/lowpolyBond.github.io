Duryodhana, the Kaurava prince, talked to Karna and the other kings.  "This is our chance!" he shouted. "The gates to victory are open!  Brave warriors fighting brave warriors—that's a glorious battle!  Let's defeat the Pandavas and win the kingdom! Or, if we die fighting, we'll go to a wonderful place in the sky!" Everyone cheered and blew their horns.

Then Ashwatthama, Drona's son, spoke.  "My father was killed unfairly by Dhrishtadyumna!" he cried.  "I swear, I won't take off my armor until I kill Dhrishtadyumna!  Arjuna, Bhima, anyone who comes at me—I'll defeat them all!"

The Kaurava army roared and charged at the Pandavas. The Pandavas charged back!  It was a huge, terrible battle.  It looked like the end of the world!

Gods and beautiful goddesses, called Apsaras, came to watch. They showered the brave warriors with flowers and magical perfumes. The sweet smells filled the air. The fighting went on and on.  The ground was covered with flowers, arrows, and fallen warriors. It was beautiful, but also very sad.  The sounds of shouting, trumpets, and bowstrings filled the air. The battle was incredibly fierce!
