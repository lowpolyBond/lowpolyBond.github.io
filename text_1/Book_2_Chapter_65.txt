One morning, the sun peeked over the horizon.  The palace was already bustling!  Musicians played happy songs, praising the king.  Birds chirped outside, adding to the cheerful sounds.  People bowed and clapped, telling stories of the king's greatness.  Servants brought the king water and beautiful things for his bath.

Everyone waited for the king to wake up.  But he didn't.  The women who helped him get ready gently touched him.  They realized something was wrong.  The king wasn't breathing!  They were very scared.

Queen Kaushalya and Queen Sumitra were already sad because their sons had left.  They were so heartbroken by the king's death that they fainted. They looked pale and weak.

The other women started crying loudly.  The sound was like a herd of elephants who had lost their leader.  Queen Kaushalya and Queen Sumitra woke up and saw the king's cold body. They cried, "Oh, my Lord!"  Queen Kaushalya fell to the ground, looking like a star that had fallen from the sky.  All the other queens were also very sad and fainted.

The whole palace was filled with sad cries.  Family and friends rushed in, weeping and hugging each other.  The queens held onto the kingâ€™s arms, crying like little children who had lost their parents.  Everyone was heartbroken.
