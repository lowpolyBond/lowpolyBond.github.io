Yudhishthira asked his grandfather Bhishma, "Grandpa, tell me all about Krishna!  He's so powerful, what amazing things has he done?"

Bhishma said, "Once, while hunting, I visited a wise man's home.  Many holy people were there. They gave me honey and yogurt.  Then, a very wise man named Kasyapa told me this story:

Long ago, the bad guys, the Asuras, were very strong and mean. They made the good gods very unhappy. The gods were scared and ran away. The Earth was sad and heavy with all the mean Asuras.

The gods went to Brahma, the creator god, and cried, "What can we do?"

Brahma said, "Don't worry! Vishnu, the most powerful god, has changed into a giant boar! He'll go down to the underworld and defeat the Asuras!"

The gods were happy!  Vishnu, as a huge boar, went down into the earth. He found the Asuras.  They were many, many, many! They tried to grab and hold the boar, but they couldn't!  Vishnu roared so loud, it shook the whole world! The gods were scared, and the Asuras fell down, dead!

The boar, with its strong hooves, fought the Asuras.  He was so strong! Because of his loud roar, Vishnu was also called Sanatana. He's also known as Padmanabha. He is the best of all wise people and the Lord of everything!

The gods went back to Brahma and asked, "What was that amazing sound?"

Brahma said, "That was Vishnu, the greatest god! He has defeated the Asuras! He's Krishna, the one who removes all problems. He is the creator of everything. Don't be afraid!"

Vishnu, the boar, went back to his normal form. He created the world from a lotus flower.  He is the creator, the protector, and the one who keeps everything going. He is the strongest of all and the Lord of everything!"
