Draupadi looked sadly at Yudhishthira.  "Yudhishthira," she said, "something isn't right. You're a good man, kind and fair. But bad things are happening to you!  Good people don't always win, it seems."

She explained, "Youâ€™ve always been good. You helped everyone. You gave food to the poor and gave gifts to the priests. You did big, important ceremonies, even when you were poor. You're the best king, a kind and brave tiger!"

"You always put goodness first," she continued. "More than your kingdom, more than your life, you chose goodness.  But even that hasn't protected you. You lost everything because of a game of dice!"

Draupadi was confused.  "Why did this happen to you? You're good! You're honest!  You're kind! How could you get tricked into gambling away everything?"

Then she talked about a bigger idea. She said, "Sometimes, good things and bad things just happen.  It's like a puppet. A puppeteer makes the puppet move, even if it wants to do something else. God is like that puppeteer. He makes things happen, good or bad,  but we don't always understand why."

"Everyone is like a bird tied to a string.  God holds the string. We can't control everything that happens to us.  Sometimes good people suffer, and bad people are happy. It's hard to understand," she sighed.

"God makes everything," Draupadi said. "He makes the sun shine and the rain fall. He makes people good or bad. He makes them happy or sad. It's like a game, and we're all playing it.  But we don't know all the rules."

Draupadi was upset seeing Yudhishthira sad, and seeing the wicked Duryodhana happy.  "Why does a bad person like Duryodhana get to be happy, while you, the best king, suffer?" she asked. "It doesn't seem fair."  She wondered, "Is it because of God's plan, or is it because some people are just stronger?"
