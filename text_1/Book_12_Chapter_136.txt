Long ago, in the land of Bharat, a wise old warrior named Bhishma told a story about kings and their riches.  He said, "A long time ago, the gods themselves taught kings how to rule wisely."

Bhishma explained that a king should never take money from people who were kind and gave to the gods.  These people were always giving away their money in ceremonies.  

But a king *could* take money from people who were selfish and never shared.  These people were like thieves!  Bhishma said that all the land and good things belonged to the king to use wisely.  He could use this money to keep his army strong and to help people.

He should use the money to have big feasts and ceremonies for the gods.  He shouldn't just keep it all for himself.  A good king should give some to help other people.  Itâ€™s like weeding a garden; you get rid of useless plants, and keep the good ones.

Bhishma also said that a good king is like a farmer. He slowly builds his kingdom, bit by bit, just like plants grow.  And just like you brush away pesky flies from a cow, a king should get rid of people who are mean and don't help others.

Finally, Bhishma said that being good and fair is like grinding stones. The more you think about it, the better you understand what is right.  So, a good king always learns to be even better!
