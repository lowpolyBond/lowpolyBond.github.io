Once upon a time, there was a powerful king named Sagara.  He had sixty thousand super-strong sons!  They were so strong, they could even fly! But they were also very mean. They bullied everyone, even the gods!

The gods and people were scared. They went to Brahma, the creator god, for help. Brahma said the sons would be punished for their bad behavior.

King Sagara decided to do a big religious ceremony called a horse sacrifice.  His sons guarded the special horse. The horse ran away and disappeared near the ocean.

The sons looked everywhere for the horse.  They couldn't find it!  Angry, their father told them, "Don't come back until you find the horse!"

The sons searched and searched. They found a big hole in the ground.  They started digging, and digging, and digging! They dug into the ocean!  They accidentally hurt lots of sea creatures.

Finally, they found the horse! But they also saw a wise man named Kapila.  They didn't listen to him and tried to grab the horse. Kapila was angry and turned them all into ash!

King Sagara was very sad.  A wise man named Narada told him what happened.  Sagara remembered something a god had told him a long time ago.

A long time ago, Sagara had sent away his own son, Asamanjas, because he was hurting other children.  Sagara felt bad about that too.

Sagara told his grandson, Ansuman, to find the horse and help his father's spirits. Ansuman went to the place where the sons had dug. He found Kapila and the horse.  Ansuman was kind and respectful.

Kapila was happy and gave Ansuman the horse. He also said that Ansuman's great-great-grandson would bring a special river, the Ganga, to help the spirits of Sagara's sons go to heaven.

Ansuman brought the horse back, and Sagara finished his ceremony.  Sagara was happy, but still sad about his sons.

Ansuman became a good king. His son, Dilipa, tried very hard to bring the Ganga River down to earth to help the spirits, but he couldn't.  Dilipa's son, Bhagiratha, finally did it! He was a very good and strong king, and he brought the Ganga River to earth to help the spirits of his great-great-grandfathers.  And that's how Sagara's sons finally found peace.
