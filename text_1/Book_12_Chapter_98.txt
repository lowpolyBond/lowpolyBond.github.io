King Yudhishthira asked his grandpa Bhishma, "Grandpa, where do brave warriors go after they die in battle?"

Bhishma said, "Yudhishthira, I'll tell you a story.  King Amvarisha went to heaven.  He saw his best general, Sudeva, flying high in a beautiful chariot! Amvarisha was surprised. He said to Indra, the king of the gods, 'I did everything right! I ruled my kingdom well, I helped everyone, I worshipped the gods, and I won many battles! Why is Sudeva doing better than me? He didn't do all those things!'"

Indra smiled and said, "Amvarisha, battle itself is a big sacrifice! Every warrior who fights bravely is taking part in this sacrifice."

Amvarisha asked, "What are the special things in this battle sacrifice?"

Indra explained, "The elephants are like the priests. The horses are helpers.  The enemies' bodies are the offerings. Their blood is the special drink. Vultures and crows eat the leftovers.  Swords and spears are the tools. The loud noises of battle are like the holy songs. The battlefield is the altar.  The brave warrior who fights without fear earns a place in heaven like mine!"

Indra continued, "A warrior who creates a river of blood – a river made of blood, bones, and broken weapons – completes this sacrifice.  A warrior who sees the enemy as his wedding partner and fights bravely achieves the best place in heaven.  A warrior who runs away dies in hell.  But a warrior who fights for his king, even until death, goes to heaven.  Beautiful women called Apsaras welcome them. Don't be sad for warriors who die bravely fighting. They become heroes in heaven!"

Bhishma finished, "Amvarisha understood.  Warriors who fight bravely win a wonderful place in heaven."
