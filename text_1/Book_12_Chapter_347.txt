Once upon a time, wise Narada visited two holy brothers, Nara and Narayana.  They were very, very good and spent a thousand years praying. Narada learned so much from them about the great god Narayana that he became very devoted.

After a long time, Narada went home.  But Nara and Narayana stayed in their special place, praying and being good.

Then, the story tells us about a king.  The king heard this story about Narayana.  The story said that loving Narayana was very important.  If you don’t love Narayana, bad things happen.  It’s like hating yourself, because Narayana is inside everyone!

The story also told the king that Krishna, who wrote the great book Mahabharata, was really Narayana on Earth! He knew all about being good and doing the right things.

The king was planning a big party and special prayers.  After hearing this wonderful story, he knew he should make his prayers even better.

The storyteller, Vaisampayana, told all of this to Saunaka and the other wise people.  He learned the story from his teacher, and it was a very, very old story, even older than his teacher!  Narada had told it to many people long ago, including the Pandavas and Krishna himself.

The story ended by saying that Narayana is the greatest of all.  He’s the protector of the world, and everyone should love and respect him.  He is kind, strong, and helps everyone. He is the beginning and the end of everything!  So, everyone should bow down to him, just like the greatest people do.
