King Duryodhana was very happy to see Karna, a mighty warrior, arrive.  "With you, Karna," he said, "our army is strong! Now, we need a new leader."

Karna said, "You are the wisest, Duryodhana.  You should decide.  All the kings want to hear your plan."

Duryodhana explained, "Bhishma, our old leader, was brave and wise. He fought bravely for ten days, but now he's going to heaven.  An army needs a leader!  It's like a boat without a captain or a car without a driver – it's lost! We need someone strong and smart to lead us."

Karna said, "Many warriors are strong and brave!  We can't have them all as leaders.  It would cause trouble.  But there is one perfect choice: Drona, our teacher! He’s wise, old, respected, and everyone will follow him.  He's the best leader.  Nobody is better than Drona!"

Duryodhana agreed. He chose Drona to be the new leader of his army, just like the gods chose Kartikeya to lead them in battle.
