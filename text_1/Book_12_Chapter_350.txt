Once upon a time, Prince Janamejaya asked a wise man named Vaisampayana a question.  He wanted to know if all the different ways people worshiped and believed were the same or different.

Vaisampayana bowed his head. He started talking about Vyasa, a very, very wise man. He said Vyasa was so special, some people believed he was even the son of Narayana, a powerful god!  Vyasa was super smart and knew everything about the holy books.

Janamejaya was confused. He'd heard Vyasa was the grandson of a sage named Vasishtha.  He asked Vaisampayana to explain how Vyasa could be both a descendant of Vasishtha and the son of Narayana.

Vaisampayana explained that long ago, Narayana created the world. He first made Brahma, another god, to help. But Brahma felt scared and couldn't do it alone.  So, Narayana gave Brahma the power of wisdom.  Then, Narayana thought, "The world needs help to stay good and fight bad people." So, Narayana created Vyasa to help keep balance in the world. Vyasa was born from Narayana's power of speech. Vyasa was given the job of taking care of the holy books and teaching people.

Vyasa grew up and did many great things, like writing the Mahabharata itself! He taught his students, including Vaisampayana, everything he knew.

Vaisampayana then explained that there are many ways to believe.  There's Sankhya, Yoga, Pancharatra, and the Vedas â€“ all different ways to understand the world and be good. But they all, in the end, talked about Narayana.  He is the source of everything good. Only people who believe truly understand this.  Narayana helps everyone, always.

So, Vaisampayana finished by telling Janamejaya that while there were many different paths, they all led to the same good place if you followed them correctly.  They all came from Narayana.
