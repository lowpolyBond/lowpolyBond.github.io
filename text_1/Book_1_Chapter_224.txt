Once upon a time, the Pandava brothers lived in a beautiful kingdom called Indraprastha.  Yudhishthira, the eldest brother, was a very fair and kind king. Everyone loved him.  He was a good ruler, always trying to do what was right and making sure everyone was happy.  He was wise and listened to his four brave brothers.  The kingdom was peaceful and prosperous, like a shining sun in the sky.  Many wise people served Yudhishthira, helping him rule.

One day, it was hot and sunny.  Bhima (another Pandava brother) said, "Let's go swim in the Yamuna River, Krishna!" Krishna, a powerful friend, agreed.  They asked Yudhishthira if they could go, and he said yes.  

They went to a lovely spot near the river.  It was beautiful, with lots of trees and big houses. There was plenty of delicious food and drinks.  Everyone had a wonderful time.  The women danced and sang, and laughed a lot.  It was a big party!

Arjuna and Krishna walked a little way away from the party.  They were sitting and chatting when a very special Brahmin priest came towards them.  He was tall and strong, with shining golden skin, like the sun.  He looked very important. Arjuna and Krishna stood up respectfully, ready to listen to him.  They knew something big was about to happen.
