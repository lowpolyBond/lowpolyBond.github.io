King Somaka was a good king, but he had a big problem: he had one hundred wives, but no sons!  He tried and tried, but still no babies.  Finally, when he was very old, one of his wives had a baby boy named Jantu.

All one hundred mothers loved Jantu very much. They spoiled him! One day, an ant bit Jantu's leg.  He cried so loudly that his mothers all cried too!  Their loud crying reached the king, who was meeting with his helpers.

The king rushed to see what was wrong. He calmed his little son. Afterward, the king talked to his wise priest. He said, “Having only one son is scary! What if he gets sick? I wanted a hundred sons! Is there a way to get many sons?”

The priest said, “Yes, there is a special ceremony, but it’s difficult.”

King Somaka said, “I don’t care if it’s hard or scary! Tell me what to do!”

The priest said, “You must offer your son, Jantu, as a gift to the gods in a special fire.  Then, your wives will each have a son.  Jantu will even be reborn to one of his mothers!”

The story doesn't say if King Somaka did this, but that's what the priest suggested.
