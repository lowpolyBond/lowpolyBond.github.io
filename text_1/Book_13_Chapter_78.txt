Long ago, a very wise king named Saudasa asked his priest, Vasishtha, a super-smart and holy man, a big question.  King Saudasa said, "Wise Vasishtha, what's the best, most holy thing in the whole wide world that will make me a good person?"

Vasishtha thought for a moment. He bowed to some cows first â€“ he loved cows! Then he said, "Cows, your Majesty! Cows are amazing!"

Vasishtha explained that cows are special:

* Cows smell good!
* Cows are home to lots of other animals.
* Cows bring good luck.
* Cows help us grow food.
* Giving something to a cow is like magic; it never disappears.
* Cows are the best food for religious ceremonies.
* Cows are part of all the important things we do.
* Cows are important in the past and the future!

Vasishtha said that even giving away just one cow if you own ten, or ten if you own a hundred, earns you lots of good karma! But he also said it's not enough just to own cows. You have to take good care of them and be kind to them, too!  You should:

* Pray to cows every morning and night.
* Never be mean to a cow.
* Never eat cow meat.
* Use cow dung for good things, not bad things.
* Never hurt cows in any way.
* Sit on a clean cowhide when you eat.
* Give gifts of ghee (clarified butter) to good people.
* Make things out of sesame seeds and gems and give them away.
* Always think of cows and be grateful for them.

Vasishtha said if you do all these things, you will be a very happy and lucky person!  He told the king to always say: "Cows are ours, and we are theirs! We are together!"  This way, you'll always feel safe and happy, even when you are scared.
