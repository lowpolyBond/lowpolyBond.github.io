Arjuna was very sad.  His family, the Yadavas, were all gone.  He told his uncle, Vasudeva, "My heart is broken.  I can't bear to see this earth without them."  The king and his brothers felt the same.  Arjuna knew they had to leave their city, Dwaraka, soon.

Arjuna first told his people, “Let’s move the women, children, and elders to Indraprastha, our other city, quickly.  The sea will soon swallow Dwaraka! Get your carts and valuables ready. Vajra, Krishna’s grandson, will be your new king.”  Everyone hurried to get ready.

That night, Arjuna stayed with Vasudeva. He woke up to terrible sounds of crying. Vasudeva had died.  The women mourned, their hair messy and jewels thrown off.  Arjuna arranged a grand funeral. Vasudeva’s four wives even joined him on the burning pyre, wanting to be with him always.

Arjuna then took care of the other dead Yadavas. He gave them proper burials.  On the seventh day, they left.  Thousands of people followed Arjuna—women, children, elders, and servants.  They were a huge, sad group, leaving behind their homes.

As they left, the sea started to cover Dwaraka! It was like magic.  The people ran faster and faster.  Arjuna led them slowly, resting in forests and near rivers.

But trouble came.  Some mean robbers, the Abhiras, saw the big group. They thought, "Arjuna is alone!  We can steal from all these women and children!"  They attacked.

Arjuna fought bravely, but something strange happened.  His magic weapons wouldn't work!  His bow was hard to use!  The robbers stole many women. Arjuna was so sad and ashamed.  He felt helpless against fate.

Arjuna finally reached a safer place. He settled the remaining Yadavas in different cities.  Vajra became the king of Indraprastha. Some widows wanted to become sadhus, giving up all worldly things. They went to live far away in the mountains.

Arjuna, heartbroken but having done all he could, went to visit the wise Vyasa. He was very, very sad, but he had done his best to save his people.
