King Dhritarashtra was very wise.  But he did something wrong. He sent his good brother Vidura away.  Vidura went to live with the Pandavas, his nephews.

Dhritarashtra felt terrible! He missed Vidura.  He thought about how smart Vidura was, and how much he helped everyone.  He felt so bad he fainted!

When he woke up, he cried, "Sanjaya, go find my brother! He's like a god!  I'll die if I don't see him again!"

Sanjaya, Dhritarashtra's friend, went to find Vidura. He found him with the Pandavas in the forest.  They were all living simply.  The Pandavas were happy to see Sanjaya.

Sanjaya told Vidura that Dhritarashtra was very sorry and wanted him back.  Vidura, who loved his family, agreed to go back.

When Vidura arrived, Dhritarashtra was so happy! He hugged Vidura and said, "I'm so sorry! Please forgive me!"

Vidura said, "I forgive you, brother."  He loved Dhritarashtra, even though he also loved the Pandavas.  He knew they needed his help.

The two brothers talked and apologized. They were both very happy to be together again.  They forgave each other and everything was okay.
