Once upon a time, a wise bird named Rajadharman lived near a river.  He was a kind crane. One day, a poor priest named Gautama came to his home.  Gautama was very tired and hungry.

Rajadharman was happy to help. He gave Gautama a soft bed made of pretty flowers. He gave him delicious fish to eat.  After Gautama ate, Rajadharman fanned him with his wings to keep him cool.

Rajadharman asked Gautama why he was there. Gautama explained that he was very poor and needed money.  He wanted to go to the sea to find some.

Rajadharman smiled. "Don't worry!" he said. "I'll help you."  He was a good friend.  Rajadharman knew a strong king named Virupaksha.  Virupaksha was a friend of his, and a very rich Rakshasa (a powerful being).

The next morning, Rajadharman told Gautama to go to Virupaksha's city.  He said Virupaksha would give him lots of money.  Gautama was so happy! He started walking.

He walked for a long time, eating yummy fruit along the way. Finally, he arrived at Virupaksha's amazing city. The city had tall walls and big gates.

Soon, Virupaksha's helpers found Gautama. They said, "The king wants to see you!" They brought Gautama to the palace. Gautama was amazed by the beautiful city and the rich king's home. He couldn't wait to meet the king!
