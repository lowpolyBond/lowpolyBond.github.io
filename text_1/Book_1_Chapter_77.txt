Once upon a time, a wise young man named Kacha lived with a powerful teacher named Sukra.  Kacha was learning powerful magic. After many years of studying, Kacha was ready to go home to the gods.

Sukra's daughter, Devayani, loved Kacha.  She asked him to marry her. She said, "Kacha, you are kind and smart. My father respects your father, and I respect you.  Please marry me!"

Kacha was very kind.  He said, "Devayani, you are like a sister to me. I respect you very much, but I can't marry you.  Your father is my teacher, and it wouldn't be right."

Devayani was sad. She said, "Kacha, remember how I helped you when the evil Asuras tried to kill you?  If you don't marry me, your magic won't work anymore!"

Kacha said, "Devayani, I can't marry you because you're my teacher's daughter. I'm sorry, but I must follow the rules of being a wise man."  He knew Devayani was upset, but he couldn't change his mind.

Devayani, feeling angry, said, "Then your magic will never be as powerful!"  She was upset because of her strong feelings for him.

Kacha said, "If that's your wish, then so be it. But my magic will still work for those I choose to help."

Kacha then went back to the gods. They were so happy to see him!  They said, "Kacha, you are a great hero! Your magic is amazing!  We are grateful for what you've done."  And Kacha was celebrated for his bravery and wisdom.
