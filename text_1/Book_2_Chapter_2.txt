King Dasaratha, a very old king, loved his people.  He spoke to them with a booming voice, like thunder, but his words were kind.  He said, "I've been king for a very, very long time. I'm tired and old now.  My son, Rama, is the best person to be king. He's brave and kind, like the sun shining brightly."

The king asked his people, "Do you agree that Rama should be the new king?" Everyone shouted, "Yes! Yes!"  They were very happy.  It sounded like a big party!

Then, the wise men and the other leaders all talked. They said, "Rama is perfect! He's kind to everyone. He's brave like a lion, but gentle like a lamb. He is wise and strong and always tells the truth. He's the best person to rule us!"

King Dasaratha was a little unsure. He asked, "Why do you want Rama so much? Have I been a bad king?"

The people said, "No, you've been a great king! But Rama is even better! He cares about everyone, even the smallest person. He helps the poor and protects the weak.  He's fair and just."

They told him how Rama was brave and strong, but also kind and wise. He was a great archer, a good student, and he always helped people. He was like the sun, bringing happiness everywhere.  He listened to everyone and always did what was right.

Finally, King Dasaratha agreed. He was very happy that his people loved his son so much. He decided to make Rama the new king! Everyone cheered and celebrated!  They were all excited to have such a wonderful king.
