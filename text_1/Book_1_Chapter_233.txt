Once upon a time, in a forest called Khandava, lived a little bird family.  They had a cozy home in a hole in the ground.  But danger was near!  A big fire was coming closer and closer.

Their clever mother saw a hawk carry away a mouse from their hole.  "The mouse is gone!" she chirped. "You can go home now, my little ones!  It's safe!"

But the baby birds weren't so sure. "Maybe there are other mice," they peeped. "Going into the hole might still be dangerous!" They were scared of the fire, but even more scared of the hole.  "Staying here is risky, but going in the hole means certain death," they chirped. "Mom, you should leave. You can have more babies later!"

Their mother insisted, "I saw the hawk take the mouse! It's safe now, really!"  But the little birds still worried.  They knew their mom might be a little stressed. They said, "Mom, maybe you're just saying that because you're scared? You don't even know us that well!  You're young and beautiful. Go find a nice mate and have more babies! We'll take our chances with the fire. It might even send us to a better place!"

Their brave mother decided to protect herself. She flew away to a safe place, leaving her children. The fire came rushing toward the little birds. The oldest one, Jaritari, took a deep breath... and then something amazing happened.
