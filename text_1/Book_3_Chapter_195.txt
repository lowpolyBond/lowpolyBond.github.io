Once upon a time, there were two good kings, Vrishadarbha and Seduka.  They were both brave and fair.

King Vrishadarbha had a secret promise to himself: he would only give gold and silver to wise Brahmins (holy men).

One day, a Brahmin came to King Seduka. He needed a thousand horses for his teacher.  Seduka couldn't give him that many.  So, he said, "Go to King Vrishadarbha. He's very kind and will help you."

The Brahmin went to King Vrishadarbha and asked for the horses.  But King Vrishadarbha was grumpy! He hit the Brahmin with a whip!

The Brahmin was shocked. He was about to put a curse on the king, but Vrishadarbha stopped him. "Why curse someone who can't give you what you want?" he asked.

The Brahmin explained that King Seduka sent him.  Vrishadarbha felt bad for hitting him.  He said, "I'll give you everything I receive today before the sun rises!"

So, he gave the Brahmin all the taxes and gifts he received that whole day.  It was much more valuable than a thousand horses! The Brahmin was very happy.  King Vrishadarbha learned a lesson about being kind, even if he couldn't give away exactly what was asked.
