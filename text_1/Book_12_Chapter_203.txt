Once upon a time, a wise man named Manu explained the soul. He said our minds remember things from the past.  But when we're sleeping very soundly, our senses are quiet, and our soul is like the truest part of ourselves.

Imagine your soul is like a super-smart detective.  It sees everything, even things that happened long ago.  It sees happy things and sad things. It's like a silent observer.

Our soul is always there, even though we can't see it. It's like the wind – you feel it, but you can't hold it.  We can't see, hear, or touch our soul directly.  But wise people, through learning, understand it.

Our soul knows happy feelings and sad feelings, just like when we're awake, dreaming, or sleeping deeply.

We can't see our soul with our eyes, just like we can't see the other side of a really big mountain. But that doesn't mean the mountain's other side isn't there!  Our soul is always there, inside us.

People understand the soul by being wise and thinking deeply. It's like understanding the sun moves even though we can't see it move directly. We see the sun rise and set, so we know it moves.  Wise people see the soul the same way.

Catching a soul is tricky! Just like you need a net to catch fish, and a trap for a bird, you need knowledge and wisdom to understand the soul.  Only knowledge can truly show us the soul.

It's like how the moon sometimes disappears, but it’s still there, even if you can't see it.  Our soul leaves our body when we die, but it's still there, like the moon.

When the moon comes back, it's still the same moon. When we are reborn, it's the same soul,  even if we have a new body.  Even though we don't see how the moon moves across the sky, we know it's happening.  It's the same with the soul; it moves from one life to another, even though we can't see it happening.  Our actions in life, the good and the bad,  follow us, just like a shadow.
