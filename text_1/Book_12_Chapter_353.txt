Once upon a time, after a long story about a powerful god, a wise teacher named Vaisampayana told King Janamejaya another interesting tale.  This story started with a question from Yudhishthira, a very good and wise prince.

Yudhishthira asked his great grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandpa, you told us about becoming one with God.  But what are the best things for people to do in their everyday lives?"

Bhishma, who was very, very wise, answered, "Doing your duty well always leads to good things! Every job has its own special good deeds.  These good deeds are like doors that lead to happiness and heaven.  No good deed is ever wasted. If you do your job with a good heart, you'll be happy!

This made Bhishma remember a conversation between two important people:  Indra, the king of the gods, and Narada, a super-wise holy man who could travel anywhere.

Narada visited Indra in his palace.  Indra, very happy to see him, asked, "Narada, you travel everywhere! Have you seen or heard anything amazing lately?"

Narada, who knew everything, smiled and said, "I have a wonderful story to tell you!"  And then Narada told Indra a long, amazing story.

Bhishma said, "That's the story I'm going to tell you now, just like Narada told it to Indra, a long, long time ago!"
