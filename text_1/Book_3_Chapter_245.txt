Once upon a time, after a big battle, Duryodhana was captured.  The Pandavas, the good guys, rescued him.  Imagine how grumpy and ashamed Duryodhana was to go back home!  It must have been very hard for him.

King Yudhishthira, the kind king, sent Duryodhana away. Duryodhana walked slowly, his head down, feeling very sad and ashamed. He was surrounded by his army â€“ elephants, chariots, soldiers, and horses. They camped for the night in a nice, grassy place.

Duryodhana sat on a special bed.  He looked sad and sick, like the moon during an eclipse.  Then Karna, his friend, came to see him.  "Duryodhana," Karna said, "I'm so glad you're alive!  It's amazing you survived the battle!  Your brothers fought bravely, but I had to run away.  I was hurt, and I couldn't fight back.  It's a miracle you all made it home safe!"

Duryodhana's voice cracked with sadness as he answered Karna. He was still very upset about losing the battle.
