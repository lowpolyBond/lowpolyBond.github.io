Once upon a time, in the land of Bharat, the wise King Yudhishthira asked his grandfather, Bhishma, a very important question.  He said, "Grandfather, big sacrifices are great, but only rich kings can do them. What can poor people do to be good and go to heaven?"

Bhishma smiled. "My dear Yudhishthira," he said, "there are other ways to be good, just as good as big sacrifices!  I'll tell you some secrets."

Bhishma explained some special fasts. He said, "If you eat only two meals a day, one in the morning and one at night, for six whole years, and never hurt anyone or anything, and always pray to the gods, you'll go to a wonderful place!  You'll ride a golden chariot and live in a beautiful palace with lovely ladies, for millions of years!"

He told Yudhishthira about other fasts too.  If you eat only one meal a day for three years, and only with your wife, that's as good as a big sacrifice.  If you're truthful, kind, and helpful, you'll ride a cloud-white chariot pulled by swans, with beautiful women by your side!

Bhishma described many more fasts.  One meal every other day for a year?  That's another great sacrifice!  One meal every three days? That's even better! He went on and on, describing longer and longer fasts, each with its own heavenly reward: a chariot pulled by peacocks and swans, a beautiful home in the sky, and the company of kind, beautiful women.

The longer the fast, the more amazing the reward!  One fast even let you see the great god Shiva!  Another let you see the whole universe!  Bhishma said that even if you are poor, you can achieve these wonderful things by being good and keeping these fasts.

Bhishma finished by saying, "Even poor people can be as good as kings, Yudhishthira. By being kind, honest, and keeping these special fasts, they can also go to heaven and have wonderful lives."  And Yudhishthira learned a very important lesson about goodness and kindness.
