King Vasuman, a hunter, was in the forest looking for deer. He met a wise, old Rishi (a holy man).  King Vasuman bowed and asked, "Wise one, how can I be happy now and in the next life? I'm always wanting more!"

The Rishi smiled. "To be happy, control your wants.  Don't do things that hurt others.  Being good is like a safe place. The whole world is good because people are good.  You want everything, but you're still not happy! It's like seeing delicious honey, but not noticing the danger of falling."

He continued, "Wanting to be good is good, but just *wanting* isn't enough. You need to *do* good things.  A bad person who tries to be good might find it hard, but a good person who tries hard will succeed.  Live in the forest, but act like you are living in a city; live in a city, but act like you live in the forest!"

"Be good in your thoughts, words, and actions.  Give gifts to good people, when it's right to give them. Give from your heart.  Don't be angry, and don't brag about it!  Give to kind and honest people, especially those born to good families."

"Good and bad acts depend on who does them, when, and where.  Sin is like dirt.  A little cleaning gets rid of a little dirt; a lot of cleaning gets rid of a lot of dirt! Clean your heart by doing good things, and you'll be happy later."

"We all have good and bad thoughts. Choose the good ones! Respect your beliefs. Be patient. Be smart. Be calm. Be wise.  Good friends will help you be a good person!"

The Rishi explained that even kings lose their good fortune if they aren't firm in their goodness. But even if someone makes mistakes, they can become good again if they are strong and determined.

King Vasuman listened carefully. He stopped chasing his wants and started focusing on being a good king.
