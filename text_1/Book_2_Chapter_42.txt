King Dasaratha loved his son, Rama, very much.  He watched Rama's chariot go. He watched until the dust from the chariot wheels disappeared. Then, he was so sad he fell to the ground!

Queen Kaushalya and Queen Kaikeyi helped him up.  But King Dasaratha was angry with Kaikeyi. "You are not my wife anymore!" he said. "You made Rama leave!  If Bharata rules, let him not do my funeral rites!"

Queen Kaushalya helped the king into his chariot.  He was heartbroken. He thought of Rama sleeping on the hard ground instead of his soft bed. He imagined Sita walking in the forest, her feet hurt, scared of the animals.  "Kaikeyi, you got what you wanted," he cried. "But I can't live without Rama!"

The king returned to the city. It was empty and sad. Everyone was missing Rama.  The city felt quiet, like a lake without snakes, because the eagle (Rama) was gone.

The king was so sad he could hardly speak. "Take me to Queen Kaushalya," he whispered. He needed his other son's mother.  But even with Kaushalya, he was still sad. The palace felt empty without Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita. It was like the sky without the moon.

That night, King Dasaratha said to Queen Kaushalya, "I can only see Rama.  Please touch me." He missed his son so much. Queen Kaushalya sat with him and cried too.  They both missed Rama very, very much.
