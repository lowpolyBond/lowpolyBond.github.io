Once upon a time, a kind charioteer named Adhiratha and his beautiful wife, Radha, lived near the river Ganga.  They really wanted a baby, but they couldn't have one.

One day, they saw a box floating on the river.  It was a special box, decorated and filled with nice things.  Radha was curious, so she got the box.  Inside, they found a beautiful baby boy!  He was glowing like the sun, wearing shiny golden armor and earrings.

Adhiratha and Radha were so happy! They didn't have a baby, so they decided to adopt him. They named him Karna.  Later, they had more children of their own.  

Karna grew up to be very strong and skilled with a bow and arrow. He learned from great teachers and became a very famous warrior. He became friends with Duryodhana, a prince who didn't like Karna's half-brothers, the Pandavas.

Karna and Arjuna, one of the Pandavas, were always challenging each other to fights.  Secretly, Karna was Arjuna's half-brother, but nobody knew this except Karna's mother and the Sun God, who was his real father.

Even though Karna was very strong, he was also very kind.  Every day at noon, he would pray to the Sun God, and he would give away all his riches to poor Brahmins (holy people).  One day, a Brahmin came to him and asked for a very special gift.  Karna, being kind, said, "Of course, you can have it!"
