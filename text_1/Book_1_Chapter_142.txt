King Dhritarashtra was worried.  The Pandava brothers, his nephews, were getting very strong and powerful. He felt jealous! He called his wise advisor, Kanika, for help.

"Kanika," said the king, "The Pandavas are becoming too powerful. Should we fight them, or try to be friends?"

Kanika, a very clever man, said, "My king,  always be ready to act!  Watch your enemies closely. Look for their weaknesses.  Never show your own weaknesses.  Attack when they are weak.  Be like a tortoise – hide your plans! Once you start something, finish it completely.  Getting rid of an enemy is always good. If they're strong, wait for the right moment to strike.  Even a tiny spark can start a huge fire. Sometimes, pretend you don't see problems.  But always be alert, like deer sleeping in the woods. If your enemy is in your power, destroy them! Don't show mercy.  Kill them, or get rid of their resources – their money, their friends, everything!"

Dhritarashtra asked, "How can I get rid of my enemies without fighting them?"

Kanika told him a story.  There was a clever jackal who had four friends: a tiger, a mouse, a wolf, and a mongoose. They wanted to catch a strong deer.  The jackal had a plan.  He told the mouse to nibble on the deer's feet while it slept. Then the tiger would catch it.  They all ate the deer.

The jackal then tricked each of his friends. He told the tiger the mouse said the deer was *his* kill.  He told the mouse the mongoose said the deer meat was poisoned. He scared the wolf by saying the tiger was angry with him.  He told the mongoose the tiger, mouse and wolf were already defeated by him. He scared them all into leaving, and then the jackal ate all the deer meat himself!

Kanika explained, "My king, use fear, gifts, tricks, or strength to control your enemies.  Even if it’s your family, if they become enemies, defeat them! Use magic, money, or poison if you need to.  Never underestimate anyone.   If you’re angry, smile!  Speak softly before you attack.  Be kind after you win.  Destroy your enemies completely! Have spies everywhere, in every place people gather.  Be humble in words, but strong in your heart. Always be ready!"

Kanika also said, "Balance good things with bad things. Don’t be too good, or too greedy, or only focused on pleasure.  Always be ready to fight back!  And don’t completely trust even your best friends!"

Kanika advised the king to be careful of the Pandavas and to protect himself. After Kanika left, King Dhritarashtra was very sad and worried.
