Once upon a time, in a forest called Khandava, Krishna and Arjuna, two mighty warriors, decided to burn it down!  They rode in their chariots, one on each side of the forest.

They were super fast!  Any animal that tried to escape, zoom! â€“ Krishna and Arjuna would stop it.  It was like they were one person, driving one chariot, fighting together.

The forest was on fire!  Poor animals ran everywhere.  Some were burned, some were scared.  Many died, holding onto their babies, parents, or siblings.  It was very sad.  Birds flew away, but Arjuna shot arrows at them, and they fell down, crying.

The noise was HUGE! It was as loud as when the gods churned the ocean a long, long time ago!  The fire was so big, it reached the sky!

The gods in heaven were worried.  They went to Indra, their king, a powerful god who fights bad guys.  "Indra," they cried, "Agni, the fire god, is burning everything! Is the world going to end?"

Indra saw the fire.  He wanted to save the forest! He covered the sky with clouds.  He made it rain, and rain, and rain! But the fire was so hot, the rain dried up before it even reached the ground.

Indra got angry! He made even MORE clouds and poured down even MORE rain.  The forest was filled with smoke, fire, rain, and lightning. It was a scary sight!
