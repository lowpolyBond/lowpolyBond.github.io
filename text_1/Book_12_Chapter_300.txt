Once upon a time, a wise king named Yudhishthira asked his grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandpa, what's the best way to live a good life?"

Bhishma smiled. "I'll tell you a story," he said. "A long, long time ago, a beautiful golden swan met some special gods called the Sadhyas."

The Sadhyas were curious.  "Swan," they asked, "you're so wise! What's the most important thing to do? How can we be free from worries?"

The swan answered, "The best things are being kind, being honest, controlling your anger, and thinking good thoughts.  Don't hurt anyone. Don't say mean things. Listen only to wise people. Never say anything that would make someone sad."

"Imagine words as arrows," the swan explained. "Mean words hurt more than any real arrow.  If someone is mean to you, don't be mean back.  Forgive them. Being forgiving and kind is the best way to be!"

The swan continued, "Being honest is like a secret treasure.  Controlling your anger is even more important. It’s the key to freedom.  I always forgive others, even when they are unkind. I never seek revenge. I try to be good to everyone."

The swan also told the Sadhyas: "The best way to live is to be kind, honest, and controlled. If someone is mean to you, don't be mean back! Being patient and calm is better than getting angry.  Good people are happy and peaceful."

The Sadhyas asked more questions.  "Why are some people unhappy? Why do people lose their friends? Why don't people go to heaven?"

The swan said, "Unhappiness comes from being mean.  Losing friends comes from being greedy.  Not going to heaven comes from being selfish."

The Sadhyas asked, "What makes a good person great?"

The swan said, "Wisdom!  A wise person is always happy, calm, and strong, even when others are unkind. They don’t fight or argue."

"What makes a good person holy? What makes them bad? What happens to them at the end of their life?" the Sadhyas asked.

The swan replied, "Studying good things makes them holy. Being unkind makes them bad.  At the end, everyone dies. That's just the way it is."

Bhishma finished the story.  "That's the story of the swan," he said to Yudhishthira. "It teaches us that being kind, honest, and in control of our emotions is the best way to live."
