Once upon a time, a great king named Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, a very important question.  He wondered how Indra, the king of the gods, could defeat Vritra, a powerful demon who was very good and knew a lot about god Vishnu.  Vritra was super strong and seemed unbeatable.

Bhishma started to tell the story.  He said Vritra was HUGE!  He was so big that he looked like a mountain.  When Indra, the god of thunder, saw Vritra, he got scared!  Both sides started to fight.  It was a HUGE battle! Gods and demons fought with swords, axes, spears, and magical weapons. Even the sky was filled with flying rocks and fire!

But then, Vritra used magic to trick Indra.  Indra became confused and weak.  A wise sage named Vasishtha helped Indra by reminding him of how strong and powerful he was. He shouted words of encouragement to remind Indra of his divine power.

Then, other gods helped too.  They all asked the great god Shiva for help. Shiva sent a powerful fever to weaken Vritra.  Vishnu, another powerful god, gave Indra his powerful thunderbolt.  Finally, Indra, with his new strength and the thunderbolt from Vishnu, was able to defeat Vritra.  The gods and goddesses cheered, and the battle was over.

Yudhishthira learned that even though Vritra was strong and good, Indra, with the help of other gods and his own courage, won in the end. The story showed that even the strongest enemy can be defeated with bravery, help from others and belief in yourself.
