King Yayati returned to his beautiful palace.  He lived happily with his wife, Devayani.  She had a special home built for Sarmishtha, Vrishaparvan's daughter.  Sarmishtha lived in a lovely house near the king's gardens, with many servants to care for her.  Devayani and Yayati had a baby boy!

Many years passed. Sarmishtha grew up. She realized she was ready to have a baby but didn't have a husband.  She worried, "I'm getting older!  I need a husband!"  She thought, "Devayani has a baby with the king. Maybe the king can help me too."

She saw the king walking in the gardens.  She bravely went to him and asked, "King Yayati, please help me. I want to have a baby."

The king said, "Sarmishtha, you are beautiful and from a noble family. But a wise man told me I should only be with Devayani."

Sarmishtha was clever. She said, "King, it's okay to tell little white lies sometimes.  Devayani and I are both your wives. You promised to be with only one of us, but that was a little lie!"

Yayati said, "That's not true!  A king should always tell the truth."

Sarmishtha said, "A friend's husband is like your own husband.  You are married to my friend, so you are also my husband!"

Yayati agreed to help her. He loved her and agreed that he would be a father to her child.

Then Yayati and Sarmishtha spent some time together. They said goodbye and went their separate ways.  Soon, Sarmishtha had a beautiful baby boy!  He was as bright and handsome as a star.
