Once upon a time, a giant monster named Vritra was causing trouble. He was so big and strong, he filled the whole world!  Even Indra, the king of the gods, was scared.  Indra couldn't fight Vritra. He was too powerful!

Indra decided to ask Vishnu, the most powerful god of all, for help.  The gods went to Vishnu and begged him to save them. They reminded Vishnu of all the amazing things he'd done before – like taking giant steps to cover the whole world!

Vishnu said he would help.  He told the gods to try to make peace with Vritra first.  Secretly, Vishnu would hide inside Indra's magic thunderbolt.

The gods went to Vritra.  They asked him to be friends with Indra. They said the fighting was hurting everyone.  But Vritra said, "How can I be friends with my enemy?"

The wise holy men explained that friendship is always good. They urged Vritra to make peace with Indra, promising it would be good for everyone. Vritra agreed, but he asked for a promise. He asked that Indra couldn't kill him with anything wet, dry, made of wood or stone, or with any weapon, at day or night.

The gods and Vritra made peace. But Indra was still worried! He wanted to defeat Vritra.  One day, Indra saw Vritra near the ocean. It was twilight – not quite day, not quite night.  Indra saw a giant pile of sea foam.  It wasn't wet, dry, wood or stone, or a weapon!

Indra threw the sea foam at Vritra.  Vishnu, who was hidden inside, killed Vritra!  The world was happy again.  But Indra felt bad. He had tricked Vritra, and he felt guilty.  He hid away, feeling sad and ashamed.

Without Indra, the world became a terrible place.  The rain stopped, the trees withered, and everyone was scared.  The gods were worried— they needed a king!  They didn’t know what to do. This is just the beginning of Indra's story…
