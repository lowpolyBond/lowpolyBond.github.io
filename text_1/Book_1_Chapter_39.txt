Once upon a time, there was a wise snake named Elapatra.  He gave some really good advice, and all the other snakes cheered, "Great job!"

Vasuki, the king of the snakes, was very happy.  He had a little sister named Jaratkaru, and he loved taking care of her.

Not long after, the gods and the demons decided to churn the ocean.  Guess who got to be the rope?  Vasuki!  When they were done, Vasuki went to see the great god Brahma.

The gods told Brahma, "Vasuki is sad! His mother put a curse on him, and he's worried. Please help him!"

Brahma said, "I've heard your plea.  Vasuki should do what Elapatra advised. Only bad people should be harmed, not good people.  Jaratkaru is a good person.  The time has come.  Vasuki should give Jaratkaru to a holy man doing hard prayers.‚Äù

So, Vasuki, who was still sad because of his mother's curse, listened to Brahma. He wanted to help his people.  He told his snake friends, "Watch Jaratkaru, the holy man.  When he asks for a wife, tell me right away! The future of our snake family depends on it!"
