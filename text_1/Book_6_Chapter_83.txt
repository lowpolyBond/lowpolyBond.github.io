Once upon a time, during a great battle, the Pandavas were winning!  Arjuna, the son of Pandu, was super strong and defeated many Kuru warriors.  King Duryodhana saw this. He was worried!

Duryodhana told his army, "Bhishma, our strongest warrior, is fighting Arjuna.  Help him! Protect him!"  Everyone shouted, "Yes!" and rushed to help Bhishma.

Bhishma, riding a shiny chariot pulled by white horses, charged towards Arjuna. Arjuna's chariot was also amazing, with a cool monkey banner!  Everyone watching gasped – Arjuna was so strong and even Krishna, his friend, shone like the sun! Bhishma was surrounded by many brave warriors.

Meanwhile, another battle raged.  Drona, a powerful warrior, fought Virata. Drona broke Virata’s bow and even his chariot! Virata jumped onto another chariot with his son, Sankha.  But sadly, Drona shot an arrow and Sankha died.  Virata was so scared, he ran away. Drona then stopped the Pandavas’ attack.

Another warrior, Sikhandin, fought Aswatthaman, Drona's son. Sikhandin hit Aswatthaman three times.  Aswatthaman, angry, broke Sikhandin’s chariot and weapons! Sikhandin, brave as ever, grabbed a sword and fought on foot.  Aswatthaman shot many arrows at him, and even broke Sikhandin's sword.  Sikhandin jumped onto another chariot.

Then, Satyaki fought a scary demon named Alamvusha. Alamvusha broke Satyaki's bow, but Satyaki used a magic weapon and defeated the demon! Satyaki then fought many more enemy soldiers.

Dhrishtadyumna, another Pandava warrior, fought Duryodhana’s army. Duryodhana shot many arrows but stayed strong. Dhrishtadyumna then broke Duryodhana’s bow and chariot and hurt him.  Duryodhana jumped onto another chariot, helped by Sakuni.

Finally, Bhima fought Kritavarman. Kritavarman shot many arrows at Bhima, but Bhima was so strong! He destroyed Kritavarman's chariot and hurt him badly.  Kritavarman ran away but Bhima kept fighting the enemy army, very angry and powerful.
