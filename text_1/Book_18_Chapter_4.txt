Yudhishthira, the brave king, went to a special place in heaven.  Everyone praised him!  He saw Lord Krishna, shining brightly like the sun! Krishna held his awesome discus and other magical weapons.  Arjuna, Yudhishthira's brother, stood near him, also shining brightly.  Yudhishthira then saw Bhima, his strong brother, sitting with the wind god! Bhima looked amazing and powerful.

In another part of heaven, Yudhishthira saw Nakula and Sahadeva, his other brothers, glowing with light.  He also saw Draupadi, the beautiful princess, shining like the sun! She was in heaven because she had been a very good person. Indra, the king of the gods, told Yudhishthira that Draupadi was special, created just for him!  He even saw five amazing sons that Draupadi and he had in heaven!

Yudhishthira also saw many other people he knew: Karna, who was very strong,  shining as bright as twelve suns!  He saw his uncle, Dhritarashtra, and his other brother, the brave son of Kunti (he was also known as Karna).   Yudhishthira even saw all the brave warriors who fought with him, like Satyaki and Abhimanyu! They were all in heaven, enjoying themselves. He saw his own father, Pandu, with his mothers, Kunti and Madri.  He saw his teacher, Drona, and his grandfather, Bhishma. All of them had gone to heaven because they were good and brave.  They were all happy together, in a beautiful place.
