Once upon a time, a wise king named Yudhishthira asked his grandfather, Bhishma, a very old and knowledgeable man, about a story.  The story was about a king and a priest.

The priest, after a long speech, bowed to many important people. He then told the king, "May you be very successful!"  He also said, "I'm going to pray again. A goddess gave me a gift â€“ the power to always pray."

The king said, "If your prayers helped you and you want to pray more, let's share the good things that come from your prayers."

The priest answered, "You tried hard to share the good things with me. Let's be equal, and go to the same good place after we die."

When the gods heard this, they came to see!  Lots of amazing people came too:  beautiful music, rivers, mountains, even the gods themselves!  Flowers fell from the sky, and beautiful dancers twirled.

The god Heaven said, "Both the priest and the king did well. You both are blessed!"

Then, the priest and the king closed their eyes and focused on their breathing.  They became very peaceful and calm.  Then, a bright light went up to the heavens from the priest!  Everyone cried, but it was a happy cry, because the light was going to a wonderful place.

Bhishma explained that the priest went to live with the Creator God.  The king went there, too!  The gods said, "People who pray and those who do yoga reach the same amazing place!"  They were very happy to see such good things happen.

The Creator God then said, "Anyone who reads holy books or practices yoga will come to me after they die.  Now, I must go."  Then, the Creator God and all the other gods went home.

Bhishma finished the story, and asked the king, "Do you want to hear another story?"
