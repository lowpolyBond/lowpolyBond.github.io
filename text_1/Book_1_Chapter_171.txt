Once upon a time, the Pandava brothers – Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva – lived with their mother, Kunti, in a humble home.  They were in disguise!

One day, Kunti told her sons, "It's time for us to go to Panchala!"  The brothers all agreed.  They said goodbye to the kind people they were staying with and started their journey to the beautiful city of Panchala.

While they were hidden away, a very wise old man named Vyasa came to visit them.  The brothers were so happy to see him! They bowed down to show their respect.  Vyasa asked them if they were being good and kind. He talked to them about being good people.

Then Vyasa told them a special story.  He said, "A long time ago, a beautiful princess prayed to a powerful god for a husband. She asked so many times that the god gave her a special wish: five husbands! But she only wanted one.  So, the god said she would have five husbands in her next life. That princess is now in Panchala. She is Draupadi, and she will marry all five of you!"

Vyasa smiled.  "Go to Panchala!  Marry Draupadi! You will be very happy!"

After saying goodbye to the Pandavas, the wise old man went away. The Pandavas were excited! They were ready for their journey to Panchala and to meet their future wife, Draupadi.
