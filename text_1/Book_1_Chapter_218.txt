Arjuna, a strong and brave warrior, went to a special place near the ocean.  Many holy people lived nearby, but they stayed away from five sacred pools.  Arjuna asked why.

The holy people said, "Five giant crocodiles live in those pools! They grab anyone who tries to swim there!"

Arjuna, brave as ever, decided to check the pools anyway. He went to one called Saubhadra.  Splash! He jumped in for a bath.  Suddenly, a big crocodile grabbed his leg!

But Arjuna was super strong! He pulled the crocodile out of the water.  Amazingly, the crocodile changed into a beautiful woman!

Arjuna was surprised. He asked the woman, "Who are you? Why were you a crocodile?"

The woman answered, "My name is Varga. I'm a magical being from the heavens.  I have four friends.  One day, we saw a very handsome holy man meditating in the forest. We tried to distract him with our beauty and singing, but he didn't even look at us! He was so focused!  He was angry and turned us all into crocodiles for a hundred years as punishment!"

Arjuna learned that the holy manâ€™s strong will and focus had turned the beautiful beings into crocodiles.  Now they were free again.
