Once upon a time, the Pandava prince asked a wise man named Markandeya, "Tell us about lucky kings!"

Markandeya said, "King Ashtaka and his three brothers, Pratardana, Vasumanas, and Sivi, went to a big religious ceremony.  Afterwards, they met a holy man named Narada.  Narada joined them on their chariot.

One brother asked Narada, "We're all good and long-lived.  Who among us will go to heaven first, and then leave?"

Narada said, "Ashtaka will be the first to leave heaven."

"Why?" the brother asked.

Narada explained, "I stayed with Ashtaka. Once, he showed me lots of cows. When I asked whose they were, he said, 'I gave them away.' He was boasting, and that's why he'll leave heaven first."

Then another brother asked, "Of the rest of us, who's next?"

Narada said, "Pratardana."

"Why?"

Narada said, "I rode with Pratardana.  A holy man asked for a horse. Pratardana said, 'I'll give you one later.'  The holy man insisted, so Pratardana gave him a horse.  This happened again and again until he gave away all his horses!  He gave them away, but he grumbled about it, and that's why he'll leave heaven."

Next, they asked about the two brothers left. Narada said Vasumanas would be next.

"Why?" they asked.

Narada replied, "I visited Vasumanas.  He had a beautiful chariot. I praised it, and he gave it to me.  This happened twice more. But the third time I praised it, he just said, 'You've praised it enough,' and didn't give it to me! That's why he'll leave heaven."

Finally, they asked about Sivi. Narada said, "Sivi will stay in heaven, but I won't. I'm not as good as him!"

"Why?" they asked.

Narada said, "A holy man came to Sivi and asked for food.  He said, 'Kill your son and cook him for me!' Sivi did it! He cooked his son and carried the food to the holy man.  While he was going, someone told him that the holy man was burning down his palace!  Sivi didn't get angry. He calmly gave the food to the holy man, who was really a god testing him. Sivi passed the test because he was so kind and unselfish. That’s why he’s so good!"
