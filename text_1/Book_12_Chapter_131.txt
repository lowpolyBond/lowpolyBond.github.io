Once upon a time, a worried king named Yudhishthira asked his wise advisor, Bhishma, for help.  Yudhishthira was scared and unsure what to do. His kingdom was in trouble!  Enemies had taken some of his land, he was poor, his friends weren't happy, and his secrets were being told. His army was small and he was afraid.

Bhishma, the wise old man, said, "If the enemy is kind and fair, make peace with them! Give back the land they took.  If the enemy is mean and wants to fight unfairly, still make peace, even if it means giving up more land.  It's better to live to fight another day!"

Bhishma continued, "If the mean enemy still wants to fight, run away! Leave your city, leave your riches. Save your life! Your life is more important than anything else.  Protect your family, but your safety comes first. Never let the enemy capture you."

Yudhishthira asked another question. "What if my people are unhappy, the enemy is attacking, I have no money, and my secrets are out?"

Bhishma answered, "If the enemy is fair, try to make peace again.  But if they are mean, be brave! Fight hard! Try to push them out of your kingdom.  If you must, fight bravely and die a hero!  Going to heaven is a good reward. Even a small army can win if they are loyal, happy, and work together.  Winning a battle brings glory, but dying a brave warrior takes you to heaven to be with the great gods!"
