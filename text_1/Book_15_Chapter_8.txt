King Yudhishthira said, "I'll do what you say, my king.  Please tell me what to do next.  Grandfather Bhishma is in heaven now. Krishna has gone home.  Vidura and Sanjaya are going to the forest with you.  So, who better than you to teach me?"

King Dhritarashtra, Yudhishthira's uncle, wanted to go live in the forest. He told Yudhishthira, "I'm very tired, my son."  Then he went to talk to his wife, Gandhari.

Gandhari asked, "You have permission from the wise Vyasa, but when will you leave for the forest with Yudhishthira's permission?"

Dhritarashtra said, "I have Vyasa's permission.  I just need Yudhishthira's okay.  Before I go, I want to give away some of my wealth to remember my sons who loved to gamble so much."

Dhritarashtra sent for Yudhishthira.  Yudhishthira brought everything Dhritarashtra needed.  Many people – Brahmins, warriors, farmers, and others – came to Dhritarashtra's palace.  The old king saw them all.

He said, "We've all been friends for a long, long time.  I'm going to live in the forest with Gandhari. Vyasa and Yudhishthira have said it's okay.  I need your permission, too. Please don't say no.  We've always been good to each other, more than kings and people usually are. I'm very old, and I've lost my sons.  Gandhari and I are very sad.  Now that Yudhishthira is king, I'm happy.  Happier than I ever would have been with Duryodhana as king.  The forest is the only place for me now. Please let me go."

Everyone cried.  They were so sad. Dhritarashtra felt bad to see them so upset, so he spoke again.
