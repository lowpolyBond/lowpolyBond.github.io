Once upon a time, King Srinjaya heard a long story about brave kings.  The story was so amazing, it made him feel better.  But he was still very sad.  He had lost his son!

A wise man named Narada noticed King Srinjaya was sad.  He asked, "Did you understand the story? Or are you still sad?"

King Srinjaya said, "The story was wonderful! It made my sadness go away like the sun chasing away darkness. But I'm still sad about my son."

Narada smiled. "Because you listened to the story, you can ask for anything you wish! I will always tell the truth."

King Srinjaya was so grateful, he just said, "I'm happy you are pleased with me.  That's all I need!"

But Narada was kind.  He said, "I will bring your son back from the scary place where bad things happen!"

And POOF!  Srinjaya's son appeared! He looked just like the son of a rich god.  Srinjaya was overjoyed!

But then, Narada explained something important.  Srinjaya's son wasn't a brave warrior like Abhimanyu, another brave boy from the story. Abhimanyu died fighting bravely in a big battle. He was a hero, and heroes go to a beautiful place after they die.  They don't come back.

Narada said, "Your son wasn't brave. He died a bad death. That's why he could come back.  Abhimanyu was a hero.  Heroes stay where they belong."

Narada told King Srinjaya not to be sad about heroes who died bravely. He said, "It's better to celebrate their lives and be brave ourselves!" Then Narada disappeared.

King Srinjaya was happy, but he still wondered what to say to his friend, Dhananjaya, whose son, Abhimanyu, had died.
