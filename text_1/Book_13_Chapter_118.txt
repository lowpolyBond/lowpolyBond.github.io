Once upon a time, there was a tiny worm crawling on the road.  A great wise man, Vyasa, saw him.  Vyasa was so powerful because he did many good deeds.  He told the worm, "Little worm, you're not as silly as other worms because of a good deed you did long ago.  And I helped you, too!"

Vyasa explained that even worms have past lives.  The wormâ€™s past life wasn't very good, which is why he was a worm now.  But Vyasa said, "If you do good things, you can become something better!"

Vyasa promised to help the worm.  He said, "You could become a great Brahmin, a wise and holy person. You'll have a wonderful life, with lots of good food and a comfortable bed!"

Just then, a big cart came rumbling down the road.  Sadly, the worm was squashed!

But Vyasa's magic worked! The worm was reborn as a brave prince!  He lived in a beautiful palace, rode strong elephants, and had many servants.

The prince, now a man, went to find Vyasa. He was so happy and thankful.  He bowed down and said, "Wise man, I was a worm! Now I'm a prince! Thank you!"

Vyasa smiled.  "You're a good prince now," he said, "but you still have some bad things from your past life to fix." He explained that even though the prince was a prince now, he could become even better.  "If you protect cows and wise people, even giving your life for them, you can become a Brahmin," Vyasa said.  "Then you'll go to heaven and be happy forever!"

Vyasa taught the prince that everyone can become better by doing good deeds.  Even a tiny worm can become a great prince, and a prince can become something even greater!
