Yudhishthira, the wise king, was talking to a learned person.  He said, "It's hard to know what's right and wrong!  People say to follow the good examples in the holy books, the Vedas, but it's tricky."

He continued, "Sometimes people do bad things that *seem* good, and sometimes good people do things that *seem* bad.  What's right changes over time too!  The rules were different a long, long time ago.  What was right then isn't always right now."

Yudhishthira wondered, "The Vedas say what's right, but even the Vedas change!  And sometimes good people disagree.  How can we know what's really right?"

He gave an example: "Rich people have different duties than poor people. What is right for someone in trouble is different from what’s right for someone safe.  The holy books don't always have the answers for everyone in every situation.”

"Even experts don't always agree," said Yudhishthira. "It's like trying to catch smoke—it's hard to grab hold of! Righteousness can seem far away, but up close, it’s hard to see clearly. It's like a tiny pond that dries up quickly, or like the rules in the ancient books that are hard to follow today."

Some people pretend to be good, he said. Others just follow the crowd.  It's confusing!  What *is* truly right?

Finally, Yudhishthira said, "Maybe the best way is to follow what the wisest people of the past taught us, even if it's hard to understand sometimes."  He believed that the truly right thing to do is always the kindest and best thing for everyone, even if it’s hard to see how.
