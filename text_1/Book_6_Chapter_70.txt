Once upon a time, there was a huge battle!  Bhishma, a strong warrior, fought hard to protect his friends.  It was a terrible, noisy battle!

Elephants trumpeted loudly. Horses neighed.  Drums beat.  Conches blew!  It was so loud, it shook the sky!  The warriors roared like angry bulls.  Arrows flew everywhere.  Many brave soldiers fell.

The ground was covered with things:  heads, arms, legs, and broken weapons.  It looked like a terrible storm of blood and broken things.  The dust was thick like a dark cloud.  The shiny weapons flashed like lightning.  Rivers of blood flowed across the battlefield.

Even the elephants and horses were scared and ran around wildly.  The warriors fought with swords, spears, and clubs. Some even fought with their bare hands!  Many brave soldiers were hurt and fell.

The battlefield was a scary sight.  Broken bodies lay everywhere.  Many warriors, even the mighty elephants and horses, were badly hurt.  It was a terrible, terrible fight!

King Duryodhana and his army, with Bhishma leading the way, charged towards the Pandavas.  The Pandavas, angry and ready to fight, charged right back!
