Once upon a time, there was a hungry fire god named Agni.  He was really, really hungry! He wanted to eat the Khandava forest, but a powerful rain god, Indra, kept protecting it.  Indra was friends with a big snake named Takshaka who lived in the forest with all his snake family and friends.

Agni was very sad. He went to two super strong heroes, Arjuna and Krishna.  "Please help me!" he begged. "I need to eat the Khandava forest to feel better."

Arjuna and Krishna asked, "What kind of food is that?"

"The whole forest!" Agni exclaimed. "But Indra keeps putting out my flames with rain.  You're strong warriors, please stop Indra's rain and the animals from escaping while I eat!"

Arjuna and Krishna agreed to help.  But why did Agni want to eat the forest so badly?

A long time ago, there was a king named Swetaki. He loved doing big sacrifices to the gods. He did so many that the priests who helped him got tired and their eyes hurt from all the smoke.  They refused to help him anymore!

Swetaki got very upset. He went to a mountain and prayed to the great god Shiva for help.  Shiva said, "I can help, but you must pour butter into the fire without stopping for twelve whole years!"

Swetaki did it!  After twelve years, Shiva said, "I don't do sacrifices, but there's a wise priest named Durvasa. He will help you."  Swetaki's sacrifice was finally done!

But Agni had drunk so much butter during the sacrifice that he got sick! He was weak and pale.  Another god told him, "Eat the Khandava forest! That will make you strong again!"

So Agni went to the forest and started a HUGE fire!  But the animals fought back! Elephants splashed water, snakes sprayed water from their hoods, and many other animals tried to put out the flames.  Agni tried seven times, but the animals kept putting out the fire again and again!  It was a big, exciting battle between fire and the forest animals!
