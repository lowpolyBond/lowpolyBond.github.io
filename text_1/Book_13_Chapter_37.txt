King Yudhishthira was a kind king. He loved to give gifts.  But he wasn't sure who should get them!  He asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandpa, who's best to give gifts to? A total stranger? Someone I know really well? Or someone who traveled far to see me?"

Bhishma smiled. "They're all the same, my dear King!" he said. "It's important to help people who need it, like those paying for their studies or taking care of their families."  He also said it was good to help travelers who don't ask for anything.  "Give to those who need it," Bhishma explained, "but don't make your own family suffer by giving away too much."

Yudhishthira nodded. "But Grandpa, how can I know who really needs a gift?"

Bhishma said, "Look at their hearts.  Good people are kind and honest. They don't get angry easily. They are peaceful and humble.  They don't brag or put others down.  Whether they're a friend or a stranger, if they are good, they deserve your gift."

Bhishma then told Yudhishthira about bad people, too.  "Don't give gifts to people who are mean or don't respect elders and teachers," he said. "Don't give to people who lie or argue just to win.  Stay away from those who are grumpy and unkind, like a barking dog!"

Finally, Bhishma said, "The best way to be happy is to be good.  Help others, especially your family, friends and teachers.  Give gifts to people who need them and who deserve them. Then, youâ€™ll always be happy and prosperous!"
