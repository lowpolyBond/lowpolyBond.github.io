Once upon a time, a wise man named Bharadwaja asked another wise man, Bhrigu, a big question: "How did the world get made?"

Bhrigu smiled. "A powerful being, like a super-duper god, just *thought* the world into existence!  First, he made water.  Water is super important because everything needs it to live and grow.  Without water, everything would die! The whole world, even mountains and clouds, are really just different forms of water, all changed and shaped."

Bharadwaja was still curious. "But how did the water get there? And fire? And wind? And the earth?"

Bhrigu said, "Long, long ago, other wise people wondered the same thing. They were so curious, they sat very still and quiet for a very, very long time—a thousand years! They didn't eat anything, only breathed air. Then, a magical voice boomed from the sky!  It said that at the very beginning, there was only empty space, dark and still like a sleeping giant. Then, water appeared, like a dark shadow in the darkness. "

"The pressure from all that water made the wind start blowing—whoosh! Imagine a bottle.  If it's empty, it's quiet. But fill it with water, and you can hear the air inside.  The wind whooshed and blew through the water.  Then, because the wind and water rubbed together, fire appeared—whoosh!  The fire was bright and strong, and it burned away the darkness. The fire and wind mixed together and some of it fell from the sky, becoming hard and solid.  That's how we got the earth!  The earth is where everything grows and lives, and it gives us all yummy foods, pretty smells, and all the animals."
