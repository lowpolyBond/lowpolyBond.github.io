Once upon a time, high up in a big tree, lived a beautiful pigeon with his wife.  One day, his wife flew away to find food.  Night came, but she didn't return.

The pigeon was very worried.  "Oh, no!" he cried. "It was a stormy day!  Where is my wife? I miss her so much!  My home feels empty without her."

He thought about how wonderful his wife was.  She always waited for him to eat and bathe first. She was always happy when he was happy, and kind when he was sad.  She loved him very, very much.

The pigeon said, "My wife is my best friend.  A home isn't a home without her. Even a palace is lonely without someone you love."

He missed her cheerful voice and her gentle ways. He explained that his wife was his partner in everything. She helped him, cheered him, and made him feel safe and loved.  She was his most precious thing in the world.

The pigeon was so sad. He wished his wife would come home soon. He felt all alone without his loving wife. He said, "A man without a loving wife might as well live in the forest.  My wife is my home, my best friend, and everything to me!"
