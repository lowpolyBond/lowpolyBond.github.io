Once upon a time, a wise man named Agastya needed some money.  He went to visit King Srutarvan, who was very, very rich.

King Srutarvan was happy to see Agastya.  He asked, "Why have you come, wise one?"

Agastya said, "I need some money. Please give me what you can spare, without hurting anyone."

King Srutarvan said, "I spend all my money! I don't have any extra."  Agastya, who was very fair, knew that taking money would hurt the king.  So, he took the king with him.

They went to see another king, Vradhnaswa.  He was also very rich, but he said, "I spend all my money, too!"  Agastya didn't want to take money from him either.

Then, they went to see a third king, Trasadasyu.  He was super rich!  But he also said he had no extra money.

The three kings looked at each other.  They all knew a powerful giant named Ilwala who had tons of money.  "Let's ask him!" they said.

So, the three kings and Agastya went to see the giant Ilwala.  They were going to ask him for money!
