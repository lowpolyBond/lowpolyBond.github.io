Once upon a time, a wise king named Yudhishthira asked his grandpa, Bhishma, a very important question: "Grandpa, do good people all go to the same place after they die?"

Bhishma smiled. "No, my dear boy," he said. "Good deeds take you to happy places, and bad deeds take you to sad places. Let me tell you a story."

Bhishma told him about a kind priest named Gautama. Gautama found a baby elephant whose mother was gone. He felt very sorry for the little elephant, so he took care of it.  He fed it and protected it, just like a father. The elephant grew big and strong.

One day, the powerful god Indra, disguised as King Dhritarashtra, wanted the elephant. He grabbed it! Gautama was very upset. "Don't take my elephant!" he cried. "I raised him like a son!  We're friends!"

King Dhritarashtra offered Gautama lots of gifts – cows, servants, gold!  But Gautama said, "I don't need your riches!  I want my elephant!"

Gautama said he would follow Dhritarashtra, even to the Land of Yama, where good and bad people go after they die.  He would get his elephant back.

Dhritarashtra said, "Only bad people go to Yama's land! I'll go to a much better place!"

Gautama kept arguing. He listed many wonderful places – the beautiful gardens of Vaisravana, the magical forests on Mount Meru, the joyous lands of the gods. He said he would follow Dhritarashtra to each one and get his elephant back.  With each beautiful place, Dhritarashtra explained what kind of good person goes to that place.


Finally, Gautama mentioned the most amazing place of all, a heavenly place where everyone is happy. Dhritarashtra agreed, only the most amazing people get there.  

Then, Gautama realized something!  He realized King Dhritarashtra was actually Indra, the great god! Indra apologized and gave Gautama the elephant back.  Indra was very impressed by Gautama's kindness and love for the elephant. He took Gautama and his elephant to heaven!

Bhishma finished the story.  "Anyone who listens to this story every day and tries to be good will go to a very special place in the afterlife, just like Gautama."
