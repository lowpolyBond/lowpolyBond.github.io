King Dhritarashtra was very old and sad.  He decided to leave the city.  Lots of people followed him!  It was very noisy.  Dhritarashtra asked everyone to go home.  His friend Vidura and the wise Sanjaya went with him.  Dhritarashtra left Kripa and Yuyutsu behind. He gave them to Yudhishthira to look after.

After the crowd left, Yudhishthira wanted to stop his mother, Kunti, from going to the forest.  Kunti was very upset. She held Gandhari’s hand and walked on.  Kunti was sad because Karna, her son, had died in the war. She felt very guilty because she hadn’t told everyone the truth about Karna before. She wanted to do penance in the forest.  She asked Yudhishthira to be kind to all his brothers, especially Sahadeva, and to always treat Draupadi well.

Yudhishthira was very sad. He tried to stop his mother.  He reminded her how she had encouraged them to fight and win the kingdom. He said it wasn’t right for her to leave him, his brothers, Draupadi, and the kingdom now.

Bhima also begged Kunti not to go. He asked her why she had brought them all from the forest when they were babies only to leave again now that they were kings.  He pointed out how sad Nakula and Sahadeva were.  But Kunti was determined.

Draupadi, sad and crying, followed her mother-in-law, along with Subhadra. Kunti kept walking, looking at her crying sons and daughters-in-law.  Even though they were all very sad, the Pandavas and their wives followed Kunti to the forest.  Then Kunti stopped crying and spoke to her children.
