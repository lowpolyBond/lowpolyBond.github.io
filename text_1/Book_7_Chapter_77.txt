One night, Arjuna and Krishna were very sad.  They couldn't sleep.  They were so upset, they sighed like snakes!  The gods were worried too.  They thought, "What's going to happen?"

The weather turned scary.  Strong, dry winds blew.  A headless body and a club appeared in the sun!  Even though the sky was clear, there were loud claps of thunder and bright lightning.  The earth shook! The ocean waves got huge. Rivers flowed backward!  Even animals were scared; they cried and ran around.

Everyone was frightened. They knew Arjuna was very angry and had made a big promise.  Arjuna’s friend told him, “Go comfort your sister, Subhadra, and her daughter-in-law. They are very sad because Subhadra's son died in battle.”

Krishna went to Subhadra. He said, “Don’t be so sad.  Everyone dies someday. Your son was a brave warrior. He fought many battles and won.  He died like a true hero. He’s gone to a wonderful place where all his wishes will come true.  He died doing what a warrior should do.  Don’t cry.”

Krishna continued, “The king who killed your son was a bad man. He won't live through the night!  Arjuna will defeat him tomorrow. You’ll hear good news tomorrow.  Arjuna always keeps his promises. Nothing can stop him.  Even if everyone helped the bad king, Arjuna will still win.”  He comforted Subhadra and her daughter-in-law, telling them to be brave and strong.
