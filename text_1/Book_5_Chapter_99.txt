Narada, a wise man, told a story.  "Deep, deep down, in the land of the Nagas (snakes), is a city called Patalam.  It's a very special place! Even scary creatures that get swept there by the water scream with fear.  There's a magical fire there, burning bright even though it's fed by water! It's held in place by the gods.  A long time ago, the gods fought and won a big battle, and they drank a special drink called Amrita there.  We see the moon grow and shrink from Patalam.  Vishnu, a powerful god, visits Patalam often and sings beautiful songs.  

Patalam gets lots of water, so that's why it's called Patalam (which means 'underworld'). A giant elephant named Airavata gets cool water from Patalam to give to the clouds, and then Indra makes it rain!  Lots of strange creatures live there. Some sleep during the day because the sun is too hot, but the moon's magic brings them back to life at night.  Some bad guys, who lost to the gods, live there too.  Even Lord Shiva, a very powerful god, practiced magic there a long, long time ago.  Many wise people also live there, they're very thin because they pray and study all the time. They live simply, sleeping wherever they can and eating whatever food is given to them.

Great elephants like Airavata were born in Patalam.  Narada was looking for a special groom for Matali's daughter, but he didn't find anyone.  Then he saw something amazing: a huge, beautiful egg! It's been there since the beginning of the world, and nobody knows where it came from!  Narada said that when the world ends, this egg will explode and burn everything up!  Matali and Narada decided to leave, as they couldn't find the right groom."
