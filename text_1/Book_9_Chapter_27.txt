The Great War was almost over.  Only Duryodhana and his son Sudarsana were left from the Kaurava army.  Krishna, a wise friend of the Pandavas, saw Duryodhana surrounded by his remaining soldiers.

"Arjuna," Krishna said, "most of our enemies are dead.  Nakula and Sahadeva are tired from fighting.  Even Kripa, Kritavarma, and Ashvatthama have left Duryodhana's side.  Duryodhana is right there, under an umbrella, looking around nervously.  He thinks he's safe, but he's not!  Kill him, Arjuna, and the war will be won!  But hurry, before his soldiers run away!"

Arjuna agreed.  "Almost all of Dhritarashtra's sons are dead," he said.  "Bhishma, Drona, Karna, Shalya, and Jayadratha are all gone!  Duryodhana and Sudarsana won't live much longer.  Only a few hundred soldiers, horses and elephants are left.  Even then, no one can escape death!  Today, everyone will know the Pandavas are the winners!  I'll make sure no one escapes, even if they’re ten times more than me! I will also punish Shakuni for cheating at the game that started this whole war!  The wives of the Kauravas will cry when they hear their husbands are dead.”

Arjuna’s brothers, Bhima and Sahadeva, charged with him.  Shakuni fought Arjuna, Sudarsana fought Bhima, and Duryodhana fought Sahadeva.  Duryodhana hit Sahadeva hard with a spear, but Sahadeva fought back bravely.  

Arjuna was very strong! He shot many arrows, killing many soldiers. He even cut off a warrior's head with a special arrow.  One by one, he defeated all of Duryodhana’s strongest fighters.

Bhima was also furious. He defeated Sudarsana in a fierce fight.  Then, many more Kaurava soldiers attacked Bhima, but he fought them all off too!  The battle raged on, with many soldiers falling on both sides. Everyone was exhausted and sad.
