A messenger named Uluka came to the Pandavas' camp. He said, "King Duryodhana told me to tell you this."

Yudhishthira, the Pandava king, said, "Go ahead, Uluka. Tell us what Duryodhana wants."

Uluka said, "Duryodhana says, 'You lost a game of dice!  You were sent away to the forest for twelve years! You even had to work for King Virata for a year!  You were tricked! Now, be brave! Bhima promised to make Dussasana drink his blood! Your weapons are ready! The battlefield is perfect! Fight tomorrow with Krishna on your side!

"But," Uluka continued,  "Don't brag! You haven't even fought Bhishma yet! You talk about winning, but you haven't beaten Karna or Salya, who are amazing warriors!  And you haven't beaten Drona, the great teacher who's impossible to defeat!  It's like saying you'll move a mountain with your hands!

"My army is huge! It's like a giant ocean!  There are elephants, horses, and brave soldiers from everywhere! There's Bhishma, Drona, Karna, and Salya, all strong warriors. You can't win! It's impossible to win against so many strong warriors!  You will lose, and you'll be sorry!"


Uluka then turned to Arjuna.  "Arjuna," he said, "Don't brag!  Winning comes from skill, not from boasting.  Everyone can brag! You have Krishna on your side. You have a great bow.  You're a great warrior. But I still rule the kingdom! My power doesn't come from my family, it comes from the gods.  I've ruled for thirteen years while you were suffering.  I will continue to rule!  Where was your bow when you were a slave? Your strength didn't save you then. It was Krishna who freed you all. Remember, you were working as servants! You were weak and hiding.  I won't give up the kingdom, even if you have Krishna with you.  You can't scare me! Fight if you dare, but you'll lose!"
