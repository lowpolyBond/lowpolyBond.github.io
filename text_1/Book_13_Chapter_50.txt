Once upon a time, a prince named Yudhishthira asked his grandpa, Bhishma, a very wise man, some questions. He wanted to know about kindness and why cows are so special.

Bhishma said, "I'll tell you a story!  Long ago, there was a holy man named Chyavana. He wanted to be very peaceful and quiet, so he went to live in a river for twelve years. He was very kind to all the animals and fish.  He was so peaceful, he looked like the moon!"

Chyavana lived at the place where two big rivers, the Ganga and Yamuna, met. He sat very still in the water, like a log. The fish would even swim up and smell his lips!

One day, some fishermen came to catch fish. They threw a big net into the water.  They caught lots of fish, but guess what else? They caught Chyavana too! He was covered in moss and shells!

When the fishermen saw the holy man, they were very scared. They bowed down and begged for forgiveness. They had accidentally caught him in their net!

The poor fish caught in the net were dying. Chyavana felt very sad for them. He said, "Please, either let me die with the fish, or sell me with them! I lived with them, and I don't want to leave them now."

The fishermen were so frightened by Chyavana's words that they ran to tell King Nahusha what happened.

This story, Bhishma explained, shows us how kind Chyavana was. He cared so much for the fish, even more than his own life!  It also showed the fishermen how important it is to be careful and kind to all living things.
