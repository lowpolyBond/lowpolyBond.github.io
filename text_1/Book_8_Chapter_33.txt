Long ago, there was a big fight between the gods and the demons.  Duryodhana told a story about it.  A wise man had told his father the story, and now Duryodhana was telling it.

The demons were led by a bad guy named Taraka.  After the gods won, Taraka's three sons – Tarakaksha, Kamalaksha, and Vidyunmalin – were very angry.  They prayed really, really hard.  They prayed so hard they got very skinny!

Their prayers worked!  A powerful god gave them a wish. But the god warned them, "Don't wish for anything that makes you invincible!"

The brothers talked and talked.  Finally, they wished for something clever.  They wished to live in three amazing cities – one made of gold, one of silver, and one of iron.  These cities were huge and beautiful!  Each brother ruled a city.

The cities were built by a super-skilled builder named Maya.  He made them so strong that no one could destroy them easily.  There was even a magic lake in one city that brought people back to life!

The demon brothers were very powerful and mean.  They bullied everyone, even the gods!  The gods were scared.  They went to the most powerful god of all for help.

The powerful god said, "Only one person can destroy these cities: Shiva, the great god!"

The gods went to see Shiva.  They praised him with lots and lots of nice words and songs.  They told him how bad the demons were.

Shiva listened. He smiled and said, "Don't worry. I will help you."

And so, the story of how Shiva defeated the demons, using one amazing arrow to destroy the three cities, is a story for another time...
