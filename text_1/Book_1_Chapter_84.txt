King Yayati was very old and weak.  A magic spell made him this way. He wanted to be young again!  He had five sons. He asked his oldest son, Yadu, to trade places.  Yadu said, "Being old is awful! I can't eat or drink properly. No thank you!"

Yayati then asked his next son, Turvasu. Turvasu said, "Being old is no fun!  I don't want to be weak and ugly!"  Yayati was angry. He said, "Because you refused, your family will not be powerful!"

He asked his next son, Drahyu.  Drahyu said, "Old people can't even ride horses or elephants! I don't want to be old!" Yayati said, "You will only be a king of a poor, lonely place."

He asked his next son, Anu. Anu said, "Old people can't even pray properly!  I don't want your old body!" Yayati said, "You and your children will always be weak and sad."

Finally, Yayati asked his youngest son, Puru. Puru said, "Father, I will take your old body. You can be young again."

Yayati was so happy! He took Puru's youth and became young again.  Puru became old, but he was a good son.  Yayati enjoyed being young for a thousand years, then he gave his old body back to Puru and became old again. Puru's family became very powerful and important because he was such a good son.
