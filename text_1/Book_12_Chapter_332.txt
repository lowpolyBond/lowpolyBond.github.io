Once upon a time, a wise man named Narada told a story.  He said, "Happy and sad times come and go.  We can't stop them, no matter how smart or strong we are. But we should always try our best to take care of ourselves.  If we do, we'll be okay."

Narada explained that our bodies are like fragile things, easily hurt by sickness and pain.  Just like a river always flows, time keeps moving, taking our lives with it. The sun rises and sets every day, bringing both good and bad things.  Sometimes good things happen to people who don't even try, and sometimes hard-working people don't get what they want.  It's just the way things are.

He talked about how babies are made. Sometimes a couple tries very hard to have a baby and can't. Sometimes a couple who doesn't want a baby has one anyway. It's all a bit of a mystery!  When we die, our bodies change, but we don't really disappear; we just move on to a new form.  It's all part of life's journey. Even when people get sick, we can't always make them better.  Sickness comes to everyone, even kings and queens!

Narada finished, "Life is full of ups and downs. We can't control everything.  Don't worry too much about being good or bad; just focus on yourself."

A very clever young man named Suka heard Narada's story.  He thought about it hard. He realized that life is full of trouble, even having a family and learning new things.  He wondered, "What's the way to be happy and peaceful forever?"

Suka knew he wanted to escape all the sadness and change in the world.  He decided to use special exercises called Yoga to become free. He planned to leave his body and become part of the sun, a bright and unchanging place.

Suka told his friend Narada about his plan.  He then went to see his father.  Suka told his father what he wanted to do.  His father was happy for him, even though he wished Suka would stay.  Suka left his father and went to a mountain where many wise people lived, ready to start his journey to peace.
