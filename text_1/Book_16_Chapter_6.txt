Arjuna saw his uncle, Anakadundubhi, very sad.  His uncle’s sons were dead.  Arjuna was even sadder.  He cried and touched his uncle’s feet.  Anakadundubhi wanted to hug Arjuna, but he was too heartbroken. He hugged Arjuna and cried, remembering all his family and friends who had died.

Vasudeva (Krishna's father) was still alive, but he felt like he should be dead too.  He said, "Arjuna, all the great Vrishni warriors are gone!  Two of your best friends, great warriors themselves, caused this.  It was a terrible curse.  Even Krishna, who was so strong and powerful, let it happen.  He didn't stop it."

Vasudeva explained that Krishna had said, "Arjuna will come. Tell him what happened. He'll take care of everyone. Dwaravati, our city, will be swallowed by the ocean.  I'm going away.  Arjuna is like my son, so he'll do what's best."  Then Krishna left.

Vasudeva was so sad, he didn't want to eat or live anymore.  He told Arjuna, "Take care of the people here, all the women and children and the kingdom.  I'm going to die."  Arjuna was very sad, but he promised to do as Krishna asked.
