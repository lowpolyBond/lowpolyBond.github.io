Once upon a time, two wise brothers, Nara and Narayana, talked to Narada, a holy man.  They said, "Narada, you're very lucky! You saw Narayana, a powerful god, in the form of Aniruddha. Even Brahma, the creator god, hasn't seen him! Narayana is very special and hard to see. But he loves people who worship him, and that's why he showed himself to you."

Nara and Narayana explained how amazing Narayana is. They said Narayana is the source of everything!  Forgiveness comes from him, and that's why the Earth forgives. Taste comes from him, which is why water tastes good. Light and heat come from him, that's why the sun shines.  Touch comes from him, thatâ€™s why the wind feels breezy. Sound comes from him, that's why we hear things.  Even our thoughts come from him!

They told Narada about a special place where Narayana lives, a place so bright, it's like a thousand suns shining at once. Only Nara and Narayana can go there!  When good people die, they go to a special place called Aditya. There, their bodies disappear, and they become pure thoughts, joining Narayana in different forms.  Finally, they become one with the Supreme Soul, Vasudeva.  Only those who are very good and peaceful can reach Vasudeva.

Nara and Narayana said they were doing special prayers to help Narayana. They told Narada that Narayana had told him some important secrets.

Narada was very happy to hear this. He bowed down and promised to worship Narayana. He spent a thousand years with Nara and Narayana, praying and chanting holy words in their special place, called Vadari, in the mountains.
