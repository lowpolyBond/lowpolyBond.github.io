Once upon a time, Karna was talking to his friend Shalya.  Karna said, "Shalya, listen carefully! A wise man traveled far and wide. He saw many different countries and ways of life. He said the people in a place called Vahika weren't very good. They changed jobs and roles all the time, going from priest to warrior to farmer, and even to barber, then back to priest again!  It was all very mixed up."

Karna continued, "And listen to this! A long time ago, some bad men from Aratta stole a woman.  She was very angry and cursed them.  She said, 'Because you hurt me, your family's women will never be good.' That's why in Aratta, the uncles, not the fathers, take care of the family's property.  Most people know what's right and wrong.  But the Vahikas, the Madrakas and the people of the five rivers, they don't."

Karna then told Shalya about a scary monster, a Rakshasa, who said even worse things about the Vahikas and the Madrakas! The Rakshasa called them bad people.

Shalya said, "Karna, that's not fair! You can find good and bad people everywhere.  It's not right to say everyone in one place is bad.  Even in your country, people aren't perfect. Sometimes people do bad things, but there are good people too."

Then Duryodhana, Karna's friend, stopped the argument. He asked Karna to be quiet and told Shalya to fight! Karna smiled and told Shalya to keep going!
