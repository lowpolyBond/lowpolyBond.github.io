Once upon a time, a powerful king was walking in the forest.  He saw a beautiful girl and instantly fell in love!  He was so smitten that he fainted!

When he woke up, the girl was still there. She smiled and said, "Don't worry, great king! You are a brave warrior, don't lose your courage."

The king, still very much in love, said, "Oh, beautiful girl with the bright eyes! I'm burning with love for you!  Please, be my wife! My heart aches without you! Love is making me feel so sick!" He begged her to marry him.

The girl, whose name was Tapati, replied kindly, "Oh King, I can't decide for myself.  I must obey my father, the Sun God. If you truly love me, you must ask my father for my hand in marriage. You stole my heart, but I can't just run away.  Girls don't have that kind of freedom. But if my father agrees, I will happily be your wife.‚Äù

Tapati explained that she was the daughter of the Sun God and the sister of Savitri.  She said that she was very impressed with the kind king and hoped he would ask her father properly for her hand in marriage.  The king was very happy to hear this and promised to do just that.
