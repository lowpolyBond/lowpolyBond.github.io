Once upon a time, in the great land of Bharat, a wise king named Yudhishthira was worried about a powerful warrior named Karna.  He was so worried, he didn't tell anyone!  A wise man named Lomasa told Yudhishthira that his worries would go away after a great warrior, Arjuna, left.

But why was Yudhishthira so scared?  Let's go back a bit.

Twelve years had passed.  Indra, the king of the gods, wanted Karna's magical earrings and armor.  Indra knew Karna was very kind and always gave things to people who asked.  He was also Karna's father, Surya, the sun god, who was very fond of him.

So, Surya appeared to Karna in a dream.  He looked like a friendly priest.  Surya warned Karna, "Indra is coming. He'll ask for your earrings and armor. Don't give them! They're magical and protect you!"

But Karna was a very honorable man.  He told Surya, "Even if Indra asks, I'll give him my earrings and armor. I've promised to always help those in need, and this is more important than my life! People will remember my kindness, even after I'm gone.  That's more important than anything."

Karna knew giving away the magical things would make him weaker, but he felt it was the right thing to do. He believed that a good name and honor were more valuable than life itself.  He wanted to be remembered for his kindness and courage.
