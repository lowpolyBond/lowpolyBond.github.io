King Dhritarashtra was worried.  He asked, "After Arjuna promised to defeat Bhishma in battle, what did my sons, especially Duryodhana, do?  I'm afraid Bhishma, my father's brother, will be killed by Arjuna!"

Sanjaya, the messenger, told Dhritarashtra everything.  He said Bhishma, a very wise and strong warrior, agreed to lead Duryodhana's army. Bhishma said, "I'll command your army! I know all about fighting.  I'll use clever battle plans to defeat the Pandavas. Don't worry!"

Duryodhana was so happy! He said, "With you leading us and Drona fighting too, we can't lose! We'll win, even against the gods!"  Then he asked Bhishma, "Who are the best warriors on our side and the Pandavas' side?"

Bhishma answered, "King, you and your brothers are amazing warriors! You're all great at fighting with chariots, elephants, and all kinds of weapons.  You were trained by Drona and Kripa.  Youâ€™ll defeat the enemy! I, your commander, will lead you to victory.  Kritavarman is a super-strong warrior. He'll fight bravely.  Salya, the King of Madras, is also very powerful. He'll fight like a storm! Bhurisravas is another great warrior, and he's a good friend. The King of Sindhu is as strong as two ordinary warriors.  He's very angry because the Pandavas once embarrassed him, and he wants revenge!"
