Once upon a time, there was a huge battle!  Two giant armies clashed.  They were so big and bright, they looked like armies of gods and giants!

Soldiers on horses, elephants, and chariots fought bravely.  They swung swords and spears.  The battlefield was covered with fallen soldiers. It was a terrible sight.  Many brave warriors died.  Chariots crashed into each other. Elephants fought other elephants.  The battle was chaotic and loud. Soldiers fell from their chariots and elephants.  It was a terrible mess!

Then, Bhima, a very strong warrior, came forward on a huge elephant.  His elephant was strong and looked like a shining mountain. He was a mighty warrior, ready to fight!

Another brave warrior, Kshemadhurti, also rode a big elephant.  He charged toward Bhima. They fought!  Their elephants fought too! They threw spears and shot arrows.  They roared like lions!

Kshemadhurti hit Bhima with many spears.  Bhima was hurt but angry!  He threw a sharp spear at Kshemadhurti.  They kept fighting, shooting arrows and breaking each other's bows.  Finally, Kshemadhurti hit Bhima's elephant with many arrows and it fell. But Bhima jumped off and quickly killed Kshemadhurtiâ€™s elephant with his big club! Then Bhima hit Kshemadhurti, and he fell dead.


Seeing their brave leader fall, Kshemadhurti's army was sad and scared.  They ran away! The battle raged on, but the loss of Kshemadhurti changed the tide.
