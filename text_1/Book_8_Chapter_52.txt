Sanjaya told the king, "The warriors were angry!  They wanted to kill each other.  The battle started!

Lots of chariots, horses, soldiers, and elephants crashed together.  It was a huge mess!  Swords, clubs, spears, and arrows flew everywhere.  It looked like a storm of arrows!

Elephants fought elephants.  Horse riders fought horse riders. Soldiers fought soldiers. Everyone fought everyone! They pushed and shoved and crashed into each other.

The battlefield was scary! It was like a giant monster's playground.  The ground was covered in blood. It looked red and shiny, like a field of red flowers after a rain.

Broken weapons, arms, legs, and jewelry were everywhere.  Elephants fought with their tusks. They looked like giant, bloody mountains!  Some elephants were hurt. Some fell down.  Some roared and ran.

Horses, too, were hurt. Some fell, some ran away, some were trapped.  Soldiers fell down, too. They cried out for help.  They shouted their names and the names of their families.

Many arms, all shiny with gold, were cut off and lay on the ground, wiggling like snakes!  The battle was so dusty, no one could see clearly.  They couldn't tell friend from foe!

Rivers of blood flowed.  The blood was full of bones, hair, and broken weapons.  Scary animals came and ate the dead bodies.  Vultures and crows flew around happily.

But some brave warriors fought on! They didn't give up. They shouted their names and the names of their families as they fought.  The Kaurava army got tired and weak. They were like a sinking ship!"
