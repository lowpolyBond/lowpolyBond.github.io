Once upon a time, the blind King Dhritarashtra was worried. His son, Duryodhana, hated his cousins, the Pandavas.  Duryodhana and his friends, Karna and Sakuni, wanted the Pandavas gone.

Duryodhana told his father, "Let's trick the Pandavas into going to Varanavata! Then we won't have to worry about them."

Dhritarashtra thought for a moment. He remembered how good and kind King Pandu, the Pandavas' father, had been. Pandu had given him everything, even his kingdom.  Dhritarashtra worried, "The people love the Pandavas.  If we hurt them, won't the people be angry with us?"

Duryodhana said, "Don't worry, Father! We'll give everyone gifts. Then they'll be on our side. We control the money and the army, so we're powerful. Just send the Pandavas away to Varanavata."  He added, "Once I am king, they can come back."

Dhritarashtra was still worried. He knew the wise elders, Bhishma, Drona, Kripa, and Vidura, would never agree to this.  They were fair to everyone, Pandavas and Kauravas alike.  He feared they might be upset.

But Duryodhana said, "Bhishma will stay neutral. Drona's son, Ashwatthama, is on our side, so Drona will be too. Kripa will follow Drona and Ashwatthama.  And Viduraâ€¦ even if he secretly helps the Pandavas, he can't hurt us alone. So, Father, send the Pandavas away!  Please, get rid of this worry that's burning inside me like a fire!"

So, Dhritarashtra, worried and pressured by his son, began to plan how to send the Pandavas away to Varanavata.
