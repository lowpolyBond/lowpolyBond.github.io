Once upon a time, there was a great king named Samvarana. He was a strong warrior and a brave king.  One day, he saw a beautiful princess, Tapati, in the sky. He was so amazed he forgot everything else and fell to the ground!

His worried ministers found him.  They helped him up and gave him water to drink. Samvarana told everyone to leave except his wise old minister.  He then climbed a tall mountain and prayed to the sun god, Surya, for days and nights.

After twelve long days, a very holy man, a wise Rishi named Vasishtha, came to the mountain.  He knew why the king was so sad.  He went up to the sun and asked for Tapati's hand in marriage for King Samvarana.  The sun god agreed.  Tapati was a very kind princess and she happily agreed to marry King Samvarana.


Tapati came down from the sky like a bright flash of lightning.  King Samvarana was overjoyed to see her! He finally felt happy again.  The Rishi Vasishtha was a very powerful and good man.  The Gandharva (a kind of magical being) explained that Vasishtha was so holy that even anger and desire obeyed him.  He was also a very forgiving man.


The Gandharva told Arjuna (a prince who was listening to this story) about how important it is for a king to have a wise priest or holy man to guide him.  He said a strong king needs a good priest to help him rule well and make wise choices. The Gandharva continued the story, telling how Vasishtha was once friends with a very powerful king, and how both were wise and important to everyone.  The story went on to tell how King Samvarana and Tapati lived happily ever after, and they had a son named Kuru. And, because of this, Arjuna, one of the princes, was also known as a Tapatya, because of the story of Tapati.
