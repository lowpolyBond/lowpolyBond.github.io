Once upon a time, during a great battle, a brave warrior named Arjuna went to fight some scary monsters called Samsaptakas.  Another warrior, Drona, wanted to capture King Yudhishthira.

Drona's army was HUGE!  He arranged his soldiers in the shape of a giant bird called a Garuda. Duryodhana was the head of the bird!  Kripa and Kritaverman were its eyes.  Lots and lots of soldiers and elephants formed its body and wings. Karna was at the tail.  It was a massive, scary army!

Yudhishthira, the good king, saw Drona's army. It was so big and strong, like a stormy ocean!  He worried he would be captured.  He asked his friend Dhrishtadyumna for help.

Dhrishtadyumna, a super strong warrior, promised to protect Yudhishthira.  He bravely charged towards Drona!  Dhrishtadyumna and Duryodhana's son, Durmukha, fought a super hard battle!  Arrows flew everywhere!

The battle was so huge and fierce! It was a giant mess of fighting elephants, charging horses, and brave warriors. Elephants crashed into each other, and the ground was covered in blood.  Soldiers fought their own family members, they were so caught up in the battle.  It was hard to tell friend from foe!

The battle raged on, and soon everything was covered in blood.  It looked like a terrible, bloody storm.  Drona, with his powerful army, kept pushing towards Yudhishthira.  The battle was incredibly scary and chaotic.
