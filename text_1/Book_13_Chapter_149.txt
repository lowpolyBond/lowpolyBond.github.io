Once upon a time, after learning about good deeds and how to be good, King Yudhishthira asked the wise Bhishma, "Who is the one true God? Who should we ask for help?  Which God helps us if we pray to Him? What's the best way to worship? And how can we escape being born again and again?"

Bhishma smiled.  "You should always praise Lord Vishnu, the greatest of all Gods! He has a thousand names!  If you worship him with love, meditate on him, and praise him, you'll be happy and free from sorrow.  This is the best way to live.  Vishnu is kind, powerful, and the reason everything exists. He is the beginning and the end of everything. He is everywhere. He is the best protector.

He is also known as Vasudeva.  He is always true.  He is all of the best things!  He is the best, holiest, and kindest God.  At the start of the world, everything came from Him, and at the end of the world, everything goes back to Him.”

Bhishma then began to tell Yudhishthira some of Vishnu's thousand names. He said things like:

* He is in everything.
* He protects everything.
* He is the past, present, and future.
* He created everything.
* He is the soul of all.
* He is always the same.
* He is the kindest god.
* He helps those who pray to Him.

Bhishma continued listing many more names, describing how Vishnu created the world, protected it, and would eventually bring everything back to Himself.  He explained how Vishnu had many forms, sometimes as a human, sometimes as an animal, always helping people.  He had so many amazing powers!

Finally, Bhishma finished listing many of Vishnu's names. He said, "Anyone who remembers and recites these names will be safe and happy.  If a farmer says them, they'll have a good harvest. If a warrior says them, they’ll win battles.  If anyone says them, they will be happy, healthy, and safe.  And if you truly love and worship Vishnu, you'll eventually escape being reborn again and again. The whole world, including all the gods and other creatures, is under Vishnu's care. He is everything!"
