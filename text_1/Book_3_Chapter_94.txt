King Yudhishthira was very sad.  He said, "Wise Rishi, I'm a good king, but I'm so unhappy!  Why do bad people seem to do so well?"

The Rishi Lomasa smiled. "Don't worry, King," he said. "Sometimes bad people get lucky for a while. They might even win battles and get rich. But it doesn't last!  I've seen it happen many times.  Long ago, the Asuras (bad guys) were very proud. They were mean and didn't do good things.  They didn't visit holy places.  Their pride turned into anger, then meanness, and then they didn't care about being good at all.  Because they were so bad, good things left them.  Bad luck followed them.  They were destroyed."

"The Gods," Lomasa continued, "were good. They visited holy places, prayed, and did good deeds. They were kind and helpful.  Because of this, they always had good luck.  Just like kings Nriga, Shivi, and many others, they became famous and rich by being good."

"Your enemies, the sons of Dhritarashtra," Lomasa said, "are like the Asuras. They are mean and bad. They won't last. You and your brothers, if you are good, visit holy places, and do good things, you will be blessed with good luck just like the Gods!"
