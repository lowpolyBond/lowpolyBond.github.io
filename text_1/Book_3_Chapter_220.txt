Long ago, in a land filled with magic, there were many special fires.  One fire was named Bharata. It was a very good fire, and when it was happy, it helped everyone grow and thrive. Another fire was named Siva.  Siva was kind and always helped people who were sad or hurting.

Bharata and Siva had a father named Tapa. Tapa was very wise and powerful. He had three sons: Puranda, Ushma, and Manu. Manu became a very important leader.

Tapa also created five other amazing fires, all shiny like gold.  They all shared special drinks at big celebrations.  There was even a fire for the sun, called Prasanta, which rested after a long day of shining.  

Another wise person, Angiras, created a fire called Bhanu. Bhanu had six sons, each with a special job. One son, Valada, made the weak strong. Another, Manjuman, looked scary but was actually very powerful. One fire, Angiras (or Dhritiman), was very important for special ceremonies. Another helped with other ceremonies and was called Agrayana.  Agraha helped with daily offerings, and Stuva was the sixth son.

Bhanu's father, Manu, had another wife named Nisa.  They had a daughter and five more fire-gods! One fire-god, Vaiswanara, was honored first at ceremonies. Another, Viswapati, was the most powerful of all.  Manu's daughter, Swistakrit, was very important too, even though she made some bad choices.

There was a fire that lived inside all creatures, named Sannihita. It helped them see and hear.  Kapila was another special fire, very wise and powerful.  And there were other fires to help fix problems if things went wrong with the ceremonies.  Suchi, Viti, Dasyuman, Suraman, Patikrit, and Agniman were used to make everything right again.  Each fire helped with a different kind of mistake.

So there were many, many special fires, all important in their own way!
