Yayati, a great king, was sent down from heaven.  But some kind people wanted to help him!

First, Narada, a wise man, told everyone that Yayati was there.  Poof! Yayati went back to heaven without even touching the ground!  He was all sparkly and shiny again, like a beautiful prince!

Then, Vasumanas, a very generous king, said, "Yayati, all my good deeds – all my kindness – I give to you!  Use them to go back to heaven!"

Next, Pratardana, a brave warrior king, said, "Yayati, my bravery and honor, all my fame as a great hero, I give to you!"

Then Sivi, a truthful king, said,  "Yayati, I've always told the truth, even when it was hard.  Use my honesty to get back to heaven!"

Finally, Ashtaka, a wise king, said, "Yayati, I've done so many good things and sacrificed so much.  Use my good deeds to return!"

With every king's gift of good deeds, Yayati floated higher and higher!  He went back up to heaven!  Yayati's grandsons –  four very good kings – saved their grandfather with their amazing kindness and good acts. They all shouted, "Yayati, we're your grandsons! Because of our good deeds, you can go back to heaven!" And Yayati went back to his beautiful heavenly home!
