Once upon a time, the Pandava brothers – Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, and the twins – went to meet a very wise, holy man.  Yudhishthira bowed his head respectfully and greeted the holy man.  His brothers did the same.  Even their wise teacher, Dhaumya, bowed. The holy man already knew who they were.  He told them to sit.

Then, the holy man asked Yudhishthira many important questions:  "Are you always truthful?  Do you do good things? Do you show respect to your parents? Do you honor your elders and teachers? Are you kind to everyone? Do you do what is right, and avoid what is wrong? Are you humble? Do you make others happy? Even in the forest, are you still good? Is your teacher, Dhaumya, proud of you?  Do you follow the traditions of your family? Do you give to others in need? Do you live a pure life?"

Yudhishthira answered, "Wise one, I try my best to do all those things."

Then, another wise person, Arshtishena, spoke.  He said, "On top of this great mountain, amazing things happen!  You can see beautiful creatures – flying people (Kimpurushas), magical beings (Gandharvas and Apsaras), and even powerful snakes (Nagas) and birds (Suparnas).  You'll hear wonderful music, too.  But you mustn't go there! It's a place for gods and goddesses.  Only they can go there.  If anyone tries to go there, they will be in big trouble.  Even powerful Rakshasas will hurt them.  Up there, you can even see Kubera, the king of the riches, with his magical helpers.  The sounds of wonderful music can be heard all around.  Stay here until Arjuna returns. Enjoy the delicious fruits and simple food that the holy men eat.  Behave yourselves, and after this time, you will rule your kingdom!"
