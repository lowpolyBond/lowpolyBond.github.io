Once upon a time, during a great battle, a powerful giant named Ghatotkacha scared everyone away. He wanted to fight Duryodhana, the king.  Many brave soldiers tried to stop him. They shot lots of arrows!  It was like a big rain of arrows. Ghatotkacha was hurt, but he was strong. He flew high into the sky, roaring like a storm!

King Yudhishthira heard Ghatotkacha’s loud roars. He told his strong brother Bhima, "Ghatotkacha is in big trouble! He needs help!  Go quickly!"

Bhima, roared like a lion, rushed to help with his friends.  Lots of soldiers followed him—like a huge wave! They roared and their chariots rumbled, making the ground shake!  The enemy soldiers were so scared of Bhima they ran away, leaving Ghatotkacha.

Then, a HUGE battle started!  It was a giant mess!  Elephants crashed into chariots, soldiers fought soldiers, and horses bumped into each other.  So much dust flew up, you couldn't see anything!  Fathers and sons couldn't even recognize each other!  It was so noisy and scary, like ghosts fighting!

Blood flowed like a river.  The ground was covered with broken bodies of people, elephants, and horses.  The fighting was so fierce, everyone was scared!  Even the brave soldiers were afraid!

Finally, after all the fighting, the enemy army, Duryodhana’s army, ran away.
