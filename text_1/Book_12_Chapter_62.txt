King Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandfather, what are the best things for people like us to do? What will make us happy now and in the future?"

Bhishma answered, "There are four main ways of life, but only Brahmins (priests) follow all four.  Kings and others have different duties.  Many good things a king can do are already known. But those things aren't always right for everyone.  A Brahmin who acts like a king, a merchant, or a worker, will be seen as bad and will not have a good afterlife. People might even call him names like they call a dog or a wolf!

But a Brahmin who follows all the rules, who is calm and kind, who doesn't want more than he needs, and who helps others, will go to a wonderful place after death.  What you do shapes who you are.  So, King, you should see studying the holy books as just as important as ruling, farming, trading, or hunting.

Everything is ruled by time.  Good, bad, or neither, everything happens because of time. Even the good things we do run out eventually.  People usually do things they like to do. And those things shape their lives."
