King Yudhishthira wanted to hear a story.  He asked the wise Narada, "Tell me about the baby who pooped gold!"

Narada smiled. "That's a great story!  My cousin Parvata and I visited King Srinjaya.  We were treated very well.  When it was time to leave, Parvata said, 'We should give the king a gift.'  I said, 'Let's use our magic to help him get what he wants most!'"

Parvata asked King Srinjaya, "What's your biggest wish?"  The king said, "I want a strong, brave son who lives a long life and is as amazing as the god Indra!"

Parvata said, "You'll get your wish! But your son won't live forever, because your wish is almost as big as wanting to be better than Indra!"  The king's son would be named Suvarnashthivin, "Golden Poop."  "But always keep him safe from Indra," Parvata warned.

King Srinjaya was sad.  He begged Parvata to change his mind. But Parvata wouldn't.  I told the king, "Don't worry! Even if your son dies, I can bring him back!"

Soon, King Srinjaya had a baby boy.  Suvarnashthivin was strong and brave. But Indra, the god king, was jealous! He wanted to stop Suvarnashthivin.  Indra sent a tiger to kill the little prince when he was only five years old!

The tiger attacked Suvarnashthivin while he was playing.  The little prince died! His nurse cried out.  The king was heartbroken. He thought of me, Narada, and I appeared.

I told the king the whole story.  With Indra's permission, I brought Suvarnashthivin back to life!  Suvarnashthivin grew up, became king, ruled for a long, long time, and then died a happy old man.

Narada finished, "So, Yudhishthira, don't be sad!  Everything happens for a reason. Be a good king, and do great things!"
