Rama, a kind and loving prince, finished talking.  His brother, Bharata, then spoke.  Bharata said, "Brother, you are the best! Nothing makes you sad, and nothing makes you too happy. Everyone looks up to you, but you still ask for advice!

"You don't care about what you have or lose. Why should you be sad? You understand life so well; nothing can upset you! You're brave and always keep your promises. You're so wise, you know everyone's secrets!  What bothers other people doesn't bother you."

Bharata continued, "Rama, please be kind.  While I was away, Mother Kaikeyi did something wrong, and I'm sad. I should punish her, but I can't. I know what's right and wrong.  Our father, King Dasaratha, was a good man, and I can't disobey what he taught me.  He made a mistake, maybe because he was scared of Mother Kaikeyi, or maybe he was upset.  But you don't have to be punished for his mistake.  A good son doesn't blame his father. You are the king, but you don't have to tell everyone about his mistake.  Keep it a secret.

"Please, save Mother Kaikeyi, me, and our family!  You're a great warrior, Rama!  But being king is your duty, too.  You should protect your people.  Why would you leave and go live in the forest?  Being a king is the best way to help everyone.  I'm too young to be king. I need you!  Please let us all go back to Ayodhya together!  Please let Vasishtha and the others help you become king! Then everyone will be happy!

"Be like Indra, the king of the gods, who returns to his home after winning a battle.  Be the king, Rama, and make everyone happy!  I'm your servant; just tell me what to do!  Please forgive Mother Kaikeyi.  If you won't come back, I'll follow you to the forest!"

Bharata bowed down at Rama's feet, begging him.  But Rama stayed strong and didn't change his mind. Everyone was amazed by Rama's strength, but they were sad he wouldn't be king.  The merchants, wise people, and even the mothers cried, begging Rama to come back to Ayodhya.
