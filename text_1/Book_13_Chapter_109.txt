King Yudhishthira asked his grandfather Bhishma, "Grandpa, what's the best kind of special day of fasting?"

Bhishma said, "Yudhishthira, listen!  This is a very special way to worship Krishna.  If you do this, you'll be very happy."

Bhishma explained:  "On the twelfth day of the moon in each month, you fast and pray to Krishna all day and night. But you call him by a different name each month.

* **Margashirsha:** Call him Kesava.  You'll get the good luck of a big, important horse sacrifice!
* **Pausha:** Call him Narayana.  You'll get the good luck of another very special sacrifice, and great success!
* **Magha:** Call him Madhava.  You'll help your family be happy and safe.
* **Phalguna:** Call him Govinda. You'll go to a beautiful place in the sky!
* **Chaitra:** Call him Vishnu. You'll go to the place where the gods live!
* **Vaisakha:** Call him Madhusudana (the one who killed Madhu).  You'll get good luck from another important sacrifice.
* **Jyaishtha:** Call him the one who took three giant steps to cover the whole world. You'll have fun with beautiful fairies!
* **Ashadha:** Call him the clever little dwarf. You'll have fun with beautiful fairies!
* **Shravana:** Call him Sridhara. You'll get a beautiful flying car in the sky!
* **Bhadrapada:** Call him Hrishikesa.  You'll get rid of all your bad luck.
* **Aswin:** Call him Padmanabha. You'll get the good luck of giving away a thousand cows!
* **Kartika:** Call him Damodara. You'll get the good luck of *all* the sacrifices!

If you do this for a whole year, calling Krishna Pundarikaksha, you'll remember all your past lives and get lots of gold!  And if you call him Upendra every day, you'll become one with him!"

Bhishma finished, "After your special fast, give food or gifts to the wise priests.  Thereâ€™s no better way to be good and happy than this.  God Vishnu himself said so!"
