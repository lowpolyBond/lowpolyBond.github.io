Once upon a time, a clever queen wanted to make it rain.  She built a beautiful floating house! It looked like magic, with sparkly flowers, yummy fruits, and climbing plants everywhere.

She parked it near a wise man's home, a hermit named Rishyasringa.  He lived all alone in the woods with his father. The queen sent her beautiful daughter, a dancer, to meet him.

The dancer went to Rishyasringa's home. She was very polite.  "Hello," she said, "I hope you're doing well. I've come to visit. Your hermitage is lovely."

Rishyasringa was surprised.  He was a very kind hermit. He offered her food and a comfortable place to sit.  "Tell me," he said, "where is your home?"

The dancer smiled. "My home is far away," she said. "But I have a special rule: you must hug me!"

Rishyasringa offered her tasty fruits.  But the dancer didn't want them. Instead, she gave him pretty flowers, shiny clothes, and delicious drinks. She danced and laughed, and playfully touched him. She hugged him lots of times!  Then she said she had to go.

Rishyasringa was very sad when she left.  He missed her so much!  He couldn't stop thinking about her.  

His father, Vibhandaka, saw how unhappy his son was.  "Son," he asked, "what's wrong? Why aren't you doing your chores? You seem very sad. Did someone visit?"

Rishyasringa was too lovesick to answer right away. He couldn't stop thinking about the dancer's beautiful hugs.  This was the start of a big adventure!
