Imagine a special tree inside your heart.  Vyasa, a wise man, said this tree grows from a tiny seed of mistakes.  Its big trunk is made of anger and pride.  The base of the tree is our wanting to do things.  The roots are ignorance, and it drinks water made of carelessness.  Its leaves are envy.  Bad things we did before give it strength. Its little branches are worry and nervousness. Big branches are sadness. A tiny sprout is fear.  Wishes for fun things are vines wrapping around it.

Greedy people worship this tree, hoping for its fruits. But this tree brings only trouble!

Someone clever can chop down this tree! They can cut its roots with special mind training (Yoga).  This means not wanting only happy things, because wanting things too much keeps us tied down.

Our body is like a city. Our cleverness is the queen. Our mind is her helper, making decisions.  Our senses are the citizens who do what the mind tells them to. The mind wants to do lots of things, but sometimes it makes bad choices. These bad choices are like darkness and excitement.

These bad choices hurt the queen (cleverness), the citizens (senses), and the whole city (body)!  The queen and the mind become unhappy. They start to focus on things that hurt them.  Then the mind grabs the queen and the citizens and gives them to the bad choices.

Itâ€™s like a bad advisor tricking the king and his people!  So, cutting down that tree inside your heart means being careful about your wishes and making good choices.
