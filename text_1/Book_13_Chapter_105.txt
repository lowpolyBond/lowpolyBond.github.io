Once upon a time, in the land of Bharat, Yudhishthira asked his wise uncle Bhishma, "Uncle, how should older brothers treat their younger brothers, and how should younger brothers treat their older brother?"

Bhishma smiled.  "Yudhishthira," he said, "you, as the oldest, should be like a kind teacher to your brothers.  A good teacher is patient and understanding. Sometimes, you might pretend not to see small mistakes. If they do something wrong, try to gently guide them, not yell at them.  If you're always correcting them directly, it might make enemies jealous and try to cause trouble."

Bhishma continued, "The oldest brother is very important. A good oldest brother makes the family happy and strong. But a bad oldest brother can ruin everything.  If an older brother is mean and unfair, he loses his special place in the family. He might even lose his share of the family's things, and the king might punish him!  Being dishonest is very bad; it's like a poisonous flowerâ€”useless and harmful."

He explained, "If a brother is bad, he might lose his share of the family things.  If brothers want to divide the family things while their father is still alive, their father should give everyone an equal share.  But if the oldest brother is bad, the younger brothers don't have to listen to him."

Bhishma then said something very important, "Always remember, being good and kind is the best thing.  Your mother is the most important person.  After your father is gone, the oldest brother should take care of everyone, like a father.  The younger brothers should listen to and respect their older brother, just as they did their father."

Bhishma added, "The oldest sister is like a mother, too, and so is the oldest brother's wife.  They all help take care of the younger ones."  He finished by saying, "Being a good brother is very important for a happy family."
