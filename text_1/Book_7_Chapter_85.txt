King Dhritarashtra was very sad.  His son, Duryodhana, and his army had killed Abhimanyu, a brave Pandava warrior.  Dhritarashtra asked his advisor, Sanjaya, what happened the next day.

"Sanjaya," he said, "Arjuna, Abhimanyu's father, was very angry.  He was like a roaring tiger!  He carried a monkey on his flag. How could my warriors face him? They had done a terrible thing!"

Dhritarashtra described the quiet in his camp. There was no music, no singing, no dancing – just sadness.  He remembered happier times, when the camp was filled with joyful sounds. Now, only cries of sorrow could be heard. Even Drona's house, usually full of music and laughter, was silent.

Dhritarashtra said he'd warned Duryodhana to make peace with the Pandavas. He'd advised him to listen to Krishna, a wise and powerful leader.  But Duryodhana listened to his bad friends, Karna and Duhsasana, instead.  Many wise people – Bhishma, Vidura, and others – had also told Duryodhana to make peace, but he refused.

Dhritarashtra sighed, "My son was foolish! He didn't listen to anyone's good advice.  Now, look what happened!  Arjuna, Bhima, and the other Pandavas are unstoppable.  They have mighty warriors fighting with them. Who would dare fight against them?"

Dhritarashtra wondered what Duryodhana and Karna had planned next. He knew that the Pandavas were very strong, and he feared for his sons. He asked Sanjaya to tell him everything that happened after Abhimanyu’s death. He knew that his son's bad choices had brought this sadness upon them all.
