Once upon a time, in the land of Bharat, there was a big fight brewing.  Duryodhana was very angry.  Krishna, a very wise man, tried to make peace.  He told Duryodhana to stop fighting his cousins, the Pandavas.

Bhishma, a strong and wise old warrior, agreed with Krishna.  "Duryodhana," he said, "listen to Krishna!  He wants peace. If you don't listen, you'll lose everything â€“ your happiness, your friends, even your life!"

Drona, another great warrior, also spoke. "Duryodhana, Krishna and Bhishma are wise. They want what's best for you.  Listen to them! Don't fight!  Arjuna, one of the Pandavas, and Krishna are too powerful to fight."

Vidura, a very wise counselor, was sad.  He said, "Duryodhana, I'm not sad for you. I'm sad for your father and mother. Because of you, they will be alone and very unhappy."

Even Duryodhana's father, King Dhritarashtra, spoke.  "Duryodhana, listen to Krishna! Make peace with the Pandavas.  With Krishna's help, we will be happy and strong.  Don't miss this chance for peace!"

Everyone pleaded with Duryodhana to choose peace.  But would he listen?  That's a story for another time!
