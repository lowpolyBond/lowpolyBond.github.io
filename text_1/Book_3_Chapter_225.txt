Once upon a time, a very powerful baby was born!  Strange things happened. The weather went crazy â€“ hot became cold, and cold became hot! The sky shone brightly, and the earth shook.  Wise people, called Rishis, worried.  Some people in the forest thought the baby caused all the trouble because of something Agni, the god of fire, did with the wives of seven Rishis. Others blamed a bird!

Nobody knew the truth.  The baby's real mother, Swaha, secretly told him she was his mom.  When the seven Rishis heard a powerful baby was born, they sent away their wives (except Arundhati) because everyone thought they were to blame. But Swaha told them it was her, not the wives.

A wise Rishi named Viswamitra knew the whole story.  He had secretly watched Agni.  Viswamitra helped the baby, performing special ceremonies. He told everyone about the baby's six faces and celebrated him. He even told the seven Rishis their wives were innocent, but they still stayed away from them.

The gods heard about this amazing baby, Skanda. They were scared of his power! They asked Indra, the king of the gods, to kill Skanda. Indra was afraid!  He said, "This baby is too powerful! He could even defeat the creator of the universe!"

The gods then decided the powerful Mother Goddesses should kill Skanda.  But when they saw how strong he was, they changed their minds! They loved him and wanted to be his mothers. They even nursed him!

Then, Skanda's father, Agni, came to see him.  Agni was happy and took care of his son. One of the Mother Goddesses, a fierce warrior, protected Skanda like a mother hen.  Another Mother Goddess, who loved fighting, held him close. Agni even became a toy-seller to make his son happy.  And so, Skanda grew up strong and loved, surrounded by powerful protectors.
