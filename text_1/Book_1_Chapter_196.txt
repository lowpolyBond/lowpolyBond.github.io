King Drupada was throwing a big wedding feast for his daughter, Krishna!  A messenger zoomed over in a fancy golden chariot pulled by strong horses. He told the Pandavas, "King Drupada has a wonderful party ready for Krishna's wedding! Come quickly after your prayers!"

The Pandava brothers, with their brave hearts, took Kunti and Krishna in a chariot.  They rode to King Drupada's palace.  King Drupada wasn't sure who these strong warriors were, so he prepared *everything*! He had gifts for everyone, no matter what kind of person they were:  delicious fruits, pretty flowers,  shiny armor, swords, beautiful chariots, and even farming tools!

When the Pandavas arrived, Kunti and Krishna went inside to meet the ladies of the palace.  Everyone was so happy to see them!  The Pandavas were strong and handsome, with eyes like bulls and arms like snakes! King Drupada and his son were very excited.

The Pandavas sat on fancy chairs and ate a delicious meal served on gold and silver plates.  But after the yummy food, something else caught their eye.  The Pandavas were most interested in seeing all the swords, shields, and other weapons!  King Drupada and his son understood then that these were kings' sons. They were all very, very happy!
