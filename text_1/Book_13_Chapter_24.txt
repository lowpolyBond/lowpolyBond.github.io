King Yudhishthira asked a wise question: "How can someone be as bad as killing a priest, even if they don't actually kill one?"

Bhishma, a very brave and wise warrior, said, "I once asked the great sage Vyasa the same thing.  Let me tell you what he said."

Vyasa, a very, very wise man, explained:

"You're guilty of something as bad as killing a priest if..."

* "...you invite a priest to your house for a meal, but then you don't give him anything because you pretend you have no food."

* "...you stop a learned priest from earning a living."

* "...you stop thirsty cows from drinking water."

* "...you criticize the old, holy books without understanding them."

* "...you don't find a good husband for your beautiful daughter."

* "...you make priests very, very sad."

* "...you steal from people who are blind, crippled, or can't take care of themselves."

* "...you burn down the homes of holy people, forests, or villages."

Vyasa said that doing any of these things is as bad as killing a priest!  It's very important to be kind and fair to everyone.
