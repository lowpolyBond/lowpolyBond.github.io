Once upon a time, a wise man named Galava needed some special horses.  He met a princess named Madhavi.  Madhavi was very kind and agreed to help him.  She went with Galava to meet King Usinara.

Galava told the King, "This princess will give you two amazing sons, as strong as the sun and the moon!  In return, you must give me four hundred special black-eared horses."  Galava explained that he needed the horses for his teacher.

King Usinara said, "I only have two hundred of those horses!  I'd rather give you less horses and have just one son."  He was a kind and fair king, and he didn't want to take too much from his people.

Galava agreed.  He gave Madhavi to the King.  The King and Madhavi lived happily together.  Soon, they had a wonderful son, as bright as the morning sun!  They named him Sivi.

After Sivi was born, Galava came back. He took Madhavi back, and went on his way to visit someone else.  King Usinara and his son Sivi lived happily ever after.
