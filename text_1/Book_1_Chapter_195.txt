Once upon a time, in the land of Panchala, King Drupada wanted to find a husband for his beautiful daughter, Krishna.  He held a contest!  The brave young man who could string a giant bow and hit a target high in the sky would win her hand.

A handsome young man, dressed in simple deerskin, stepped forward.  He was strong and quick. He easily strung the bow and hit the target!  Wise men cheered and bowed to him. He was amazing!  A smaller, cheerful boy followed close behind him, holding onto the deerskin.

Suddenly, other kings got angry. They wanted to fight!  But, before they could, a powerful warrior appeared. He ripped up a huge tree and fought them off, like a giant!

The two young men, brave and strong, took Krishna away. They went to a potter's house. A strong woman, like a flame of fire, was there with three other powerful men – who looked like brothers.  They bowed to her. She gave some food to the little boy. Everyone ate.  They shared their food with the gods, poor people, and the family. Then they all went to sleep together, with the little boy resting near their feet.

They talked like warriors. They didn't talk like farmers or normal people. They talked like princes and kings!  King Drupada's son, Dhrishtadyumna, told his father, "I think these are the Pandava brothers!  They escaped a terrible fire long ago."

King Drupada was thrilled! He sent a priest to find out who they were. The priest met the young men.  The oldest brother, Yudhishthira, told him kindly, "We won your daughter fairly.  Only the strongest and bravest could win this contest."  He asked the priest to wash his feet, showing respect.

Just then, another messenger arrived, "The wedding feast is ready!"  And so, Krishna married the brave young man who had won the contest – Arjuna, one of the Pandava brothers.
