Long ago, there was a wonderful king named Santanu.  He was super smart, kind, and always told the truth. Everyone loved him! He was strong and brave, like a big elephant.  He was a great leader, and all the other kings looked up to him.  Because of him, everyone was happy and peaceful. They all slept soundly and woke up with smiles.  The land flourished, and everyone helped each other.  Santanu ruled from Hastinapura, a beautiful city, and his kingdom was huge.  He was so kind that even animals were safe.  He ruled for a long, long time, then he went to live quietly in the forest.

Santanu had a son, Devavrata, who was just as handsome and smart as his father.  He was amazing at fighting and knew everything! One day, Santanu saw Devavrata stopping the flow of the Ganges River with his magical powers!  Santanu didn't recognize his son because he hadn't seen him since he was a baby.  Ganga, Devavrata's mother, showed Santanu his son. Ganga told Santanu that Devavrata was very special, strong, and wise. She said he knew everything about being a king. Santanu was overjoyed to find his son.  He brought Devavrata home, and made him the heir to the throne.

Years later, Santanu smelled a sweet scent in the woods. He followed it and found a beautiful girl named Satyavati. She worked on the river, helping people cross. Santanu fell in love and wanted to marry her. Satyavati’s father agreed, but only if Santanu promised that Satyavati's son would be the next king, not Devavrata.

Santanu was sad.  He didn't want to break his promise to Devavrata! Devavrata heard about this and felt very sad for his father.  Devavrata wanted his father to be happy. He went to Satyavati’s father and made an amazing promise.  He said Satyavati’s son would be king, and he, Devavrata, would never marry and have children of his own! He would always serve his father and the kingdom.

Everyone was amazed by Devavrata's kindness. The gods showered him with flowers!  From that day on, he was called Bhishma, which means "the terrible" because of his amazing strength and selfless vow. He helped Satyavati marry his father, and everyone lived happily ever after, thanks to Bhishma’s amazing sacrifice.  Because he was so selfless, the king also gave him a special gift: Bhishma could choose when he would die.  He would live forever, until he decided it was time to go.
