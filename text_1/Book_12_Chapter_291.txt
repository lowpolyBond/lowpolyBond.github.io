King Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandfather, what's the best way to live a good life, both now and after we die?"

Bhishma smiled. "That's a great question!  King Janaka once asked the wise Parasara the same thing.  Parasara said the most important thing is to be good and do good things."

Parasara explained, "Being good is the best thing you can do!  It makes you happy now and later.  There are four ways people live:  Brahmins (priests) help others; Kshatriyas (kings and warriors) protect people; Vaisyas (farmers and traders) grow food and make things; and Sudras (workers) help everyone else. Everyone gets what they need to live.  Good actions bring good things, and bad actions bring bad things."

Parasara said it's like a pot: if you put it in gold, it becomes gold colored. If you do good things, good things happen to you.  If you do bad things, bad things happen.  It’s like planting a seed – you get what you plant!

"Some people don't believe this," said Parasara.  "They say, 'I don't see how my past actions affect me now.' But it's true!  You get what you do with your eyes, your mind, your words, and your actions."

Parasara continued, "Being good means things like: being kind, forgiving, patient, strong, happy with what you have, telling the truth, being modest, not hurting others, avoiding bad habits, and being clever.  These things make you happy. But even if you do bad things, you won’t be bad forever. If you’re sad, that means you have bad things from your past to face.  After you learn from them, the good things start to show!  You only get the results of what *you* do, not someone else’s."

Parasara said the best way to live is to be wise and focus your mind.  He also gave examples of people who weren't living well: a scared warrior, a priest who ate anything, a farmer who was lazy, a worker who didn’t work, a smart person who was unkind, a noble person who was bad, a priest who lied, a woman who was dishonest, a spiritual person who wasn't peaceful, someone who cooked only for themselves, a fool who gave speeches, a kingdom without a king, and a king who didn’t care for his people.  "These people," Parasara said, "need our help."
