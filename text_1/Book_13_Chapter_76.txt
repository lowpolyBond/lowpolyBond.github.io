King Yudhishthira wanted to know the best way to give away cows.  He asked the wise Bhishma.

Bhishma said, "Giving away cows is the best gift! It helps everyone in your family."  He told a story about King Mandhatri.

King Mandhatri wasn't sure how to give away his cows properly. He asked the wise teacher Vrihaspati.

Vrihaspati explained:  "Before giving the cows, you must be kind and respectful to wise people. Choose special cows called 'Rohini' cows. Talk to the cows nicely!  Say things like, 'Cow, you're like my mother! Bull, you're like my father!  Give me good luck!' Spend the night in the cow pen with them, and treat them with kindness."

In the morning, give away a cow, a bull, and her calf. This makes you very lucky!  The cows have magical powers. They help you live a long life, be clever, and get everything you want!

You can also give away money or clothes instead of cows, but itâ€™s not quite as good.

Giving away cows is very special, so you shouldn't tell everyone how to do it.  Many people aren't ready to learn this secret.

Many great kings did this and went to heaven.  So, Yudhishthira should do the same!

Yudhishthira listened carefully.  He started giving away cows. He even started eating only barley and sleeping on the ground like a cow!  He was a very good king after that. He stopped using cows to pull his carts.  He used horses instead, and showed everyone how much he respected cows.
