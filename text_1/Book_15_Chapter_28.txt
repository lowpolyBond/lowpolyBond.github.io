Once upon a time, after a big battle, the Pandava brothers sat down.  Vyasa, a wise man, spoke to Dhritarashtra, the blind king.  He asked, "King Dhritarashtra, are you feeling better after living in the forest?  Is your sadness about your sons gone? Are you peaceful now?"

Vyasa then asked about Dhritarashtra's wife, Gandhari.  "Is Gandhari still sad? She's very wise, isn't she? Does she understand things are better now? How about Kunti? Is she taking care of you? Are the Pandava brothers – Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, and the twins – doing okay? Are you happy to see them?"

Vyasa said, "Being kind, telling the truth, and not being angry are the most important things.  Is forest life still hard for you, King? Can you find enough food? Are you alright with fasting?"

Then Vyasa told Dhritarashtra about Vidura, a very wise man. "Vidura was like a god of goodness. He was even wiser than other wise people! He had special powers and was like a god.  He was your brother!"

Vyasa explained that Vidura had passed away. He said, "Vidura was so good, he actually went into Yudhishthira!  Yudhishthira is like a part of Vidura, because he’s full of goodness, too.  Goodness is everywhere. It's like air or water. Only very good people can see it."

Vyasa told Dhritarashtra, "I’m here to help you feel better.  I have special powers. Tell me, what do you want me to do?"
