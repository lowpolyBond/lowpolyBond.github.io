Once upon a time, after the Pandavas lost everything in a game of dice, their mother, Kunti, spoke to them.  "My dear sons," she said, "I know you've been sad and discouraged.  I remember when you lost your kingdom.  You felt hopeless, and your relatives treated you badly."

Kunti explained, "I gave you all courage! I wanted to make sure you didn't give up.  You are all strong and brave, like the gods! You are equal to Indra, the king of the gods! I didn't want you to live sadly, always looking at others."

She continued, "I encouraged you, Yudhishthira, because you are so good and fair.  I didn't want you to live a poor life in the forest again.  I encouraged you, Bhima, because you are as strong as ten thousand elephants! I didn't want you to be weak and sad. And I encouraged Arjuna, because he's also as brave as Indra. I didn't want him to feel down.  I even encouraged Nakula and Sahadeva, so they wouldn't be hungry and unhappy."

Kunti remembered how badly Draupadi, their wife, had been treated.  "I saw Dussasana, the wicked man, pull Draupadi's hair in front of everyone!  She was sick and helpless, like a scared bird.  That made me very angry."

Kunti told her sons, "I gave you strength because I wanted to protect our family name.  It was important to me that the Pandavas never be forgotten. Families who do bad things lose their good fortune.  I knew the Kauravas were in danger of losing their happiness.  I myself, once had a good life with my husband. We were rich, and I gave away lots of gifts. But this wasn't about me.  I only wanted what was best for all of you."

Then Kunti said, "I don't want to be queen again.  I want to live a simple life, and serve my in-laws.  I want to spend my time praying and becoming a better person.  Yudhishthira, my dearest son, you and your brothers should always be good and kind.  Don't let anything stop you from doing what's right."
