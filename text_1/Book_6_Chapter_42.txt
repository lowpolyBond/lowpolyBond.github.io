Arjuna was feeling sad. He didn't want to fight his family. He asked Krishna, a wise and powerful friend, about giving up fighting.

Krishna explained that giving up can mean different things.  You can give up wanting things to happen a certain way. Or, you can give up wanting the rewards for your actions. Some people even think you should give up all work, but that's not always right.

Krishna said there are three kinds of giving up:

1. **Giving up because you're scared:** This is bad.  It's like giving up because you're afraid of getting hurt.

2. **Giving up good things:** This is also bad.  You shouldn't give up doing good things like helping others or praying.  You just shouldn't do them for rewards.

3. **Giving up wanting rewards:** This is the best kind. You do good things, but you don't care about getting anything in return.  It's like doing chores because it's the right thing to do, not for a treat.

Krishna said that everyone has to do things.  Even if you're just thinking, you're doing something.  But you shouldn't worry about the results. If you focus on doing what's right, without worrying about what you get, youâ€™ll be happy.

He explained that there are three types of knowledge, action, and people: good, passionate, and dark. Good people do what's right, passionate people want things for themselves, and dark people do bad things without thinking.

Krishna told Arjuna to focus on his duty, and to do it without worrying about what happens next. He told him to do his best, and to trust in him.

Krishna said that by doing his duty and trusting Krishna, Arjuna would be happy and successful. He shouldn't worry. Krishna would help him.

Arjuna listened to Krishna. He felt better. He understood.  He was ready to fight, but now with a calm heart.

Sanjaya, who had heard everything, told the king about this amazing conversation. He said it was the most wonderful and important story ever.  He said that following Krishna's wisdom would bring success and happiness.
