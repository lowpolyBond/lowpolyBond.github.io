Bhima, the strong Pandava brother, came to a mountain near Kailasa.  He found a beautiful lake! It was surrounded by lush green trees and flowers.  The water was sparkling and clear, like a giant mirror.  Pretty golden lotuses floated on the water, and lots of colorful birds sang.

This wasn't just any lake.  It belonged to Kuvera, the rich king of the Yakshas!  It was magical, filled with special flowers, and even the gods and other magical creatures visited it.  

Many Rakshasas, scary-looking creatures, guarded the lake. They wore uniforms and carried weapons, just like soldiers.  They were there to protect the lake, as they were ordered by Kuvera.

Bhima, wearing deer skin clothes and carrying his weapons, walked toward the lake to pick some of those pretty lotuses. The Rakshasas spotted him.  They shouted to each other, "Hey! Who is this man? Let's ask him what he wants!"

They all went up to Bhima and asked, "Who are you? Why are you here? You look like a holy man, but you're also carrying weapons. Tell us what you're doing!"
