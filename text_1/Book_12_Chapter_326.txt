Suka, a very good boy, wanted to learn about peace and happiness.  He went to his wise father, Vyasa, and asked him how to find it.  Vyasa told Suka to study hard and then visit King Janaka.

Vyasa gave Suka special instructions.  He said, "Go to King Janaka by walking, not by flying!  Don't make friends along the way, because friends can distract you.  Be humble, even though Janaka is important."

Suka listened carefully.  He walked a very long way! He crossed mountains and rivers, forests and plains. He saw many amazing things, but he kept his mind on his goal. He didn't stop to play or explore. He wanted to reach King Janaka to learn how to be peaceful and happy.

Finally, Suka reached Janaka's city, Mithila.  The guards at the palace were a little grumpy and told him to wait. Suka didn't get mad; he just waited calmly.  A kind guard saw how peaceful Suka was and led him inside.

Janaka's palace was beautiful!  Pretty ladies welcomed Suka and gave him delicious food. They showed him the gardens and sang for him.  But Suka didn't let all the beauty distract him. He kept thinking about finding inner peace.  He prayed, slept a little, and then prayed some more, all while surrounded by these kind, happy ladies. Even so, he still only cared about learning how to be at peace.

Suka spent the rest of the day and night at the palace, always focused on finding peace.  He was a very good boy, and his journey to learn about peace was just beginning.
