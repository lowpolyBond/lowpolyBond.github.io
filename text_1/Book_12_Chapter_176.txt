Once upon a time, a wise king named Yudhishthira asked his grandfather, Bhishma, a very old and wise man, "Grandpa, why are some people happy and some people sad?  Does it matter if they are rich or poor?"

Bhishma smiled.  "That's a great question!" he said. "I remember a story a poor man once told me. This man was very unhappy. His wife was mean, his clothes were ragged, and he was always hungry. But he tried to live a simple life, giving up all his wants."

The poor man told Bhishma, "Happiness and sadness come to everyone.  It's like a game of chance.  If we don't get attached to things, we won't be so sad when bad things happen."

"He said that wanting things makes us unhappy," Bhishma continued. "He said giving up everything and living simply is the best way to be truly happy.  Imagine – sleeping soundly and waking up happy, every day!  He said being poor and good is better than being a rich king!  A king always worries about losing everything.  But a poor person has nothing to lose, not even fear of fire, enemies, or death!"

"The poor man said a rich person is often angry and greedy," Bhishma explained. "They're always looking for more. They're mean and unhappy.  Nobody wants to be around them.  Being rich makes people think they're better than everyone else, making them unhappy in the end."

"He said rich people are like deer chased in the woods by hunters – they are always running from something!  Being rich makes people careless and greedy.  They take things that aren't theirs," Bhishma added. "But the poor, good person has peace. They are truly free."

"The poor man said the only way to true happiness is to give up wanting things," Bhishma concluded. "That's what makes you truly free.  That's why I believe giving up all that you want is the most important thing in life."
