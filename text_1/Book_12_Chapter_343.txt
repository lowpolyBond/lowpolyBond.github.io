Once upon a time, Arjuna, a great warrior, asked Krishna, "Krishna, how did fire (Agni) and the moon (Soma) become one? I'm confused!"

Krishna smiled. "Arjuna, I'll tell you an old story. Listen closely!  A very, very long time ago, the whole world ended. Everything disappeared – the sun, the earth, the air – leaving only dark water.  It was like a big, empty ocean. Then, from darkness, a powerful being called Hari appeared.  Hari was amazing!  He had no body, but he was everywhere. He was kind and all-powerful. He created everything.

Hari made fire and the moon from his eyes. He made people, too.  The first people were called Brahmins and Kshatriyas.  The Brahmins were like the moon, peaceful and wise. The Kshatriyas were like fire, strong and brave.  Brahmins were even stronger because they were made first.  They helped everyone by doing ceremonies and prayers.  They were like fire, accepting offerings from others.

Then Krishna told stories of how different gods and people did good and bad things.  He talked about Indra, the king of the gods, who lost his power because of a mistake.  He told about a giant named Viswarupa who was tricked, and another giant, Vritra, who had to be defeated. Then Indra got a new friend: Nahusha, who was powerful but wanted Indra’s wife!  She tricked him with a clever plan, using wise people as his chariot. That is how Indra got his power back.

Krishna also talked about a great fight between him and Rudra, another powerful god.  They fought a huge battle! The whole world shook!  But then Brahma, the creator, stepped in. He explained that Krishna and Rudra were really the same, just different parts of the same powerful being. They made peace, making marks on each other that became symbols of friendship.

Krishna finished by saying, "In that old battle, I won.  And Arjuna, I've told you all this to show you that the world is kept together by the power of good people like the Brahmins and the power of strength like the Kshatriyas. They’re like the moon and the fire, working together."  Arjuna understood everything Krishna had explained. He knew then how the moon and fire are one, and how even powerful gods can learn to be friends.
