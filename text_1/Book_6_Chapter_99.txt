Once upon a time, during a great war, a brave warrior named Bhishma was hurt, not by weapons, but by mean words from Duryodhana.  Bhishma was sad, but he didn't say anything mean back. He thought for a long time.  Then, he spoke calmly.

"Duryodhana," Bhishma said, "why do you hurt me with your words? I always try my best to help you. I'd even give my life for you! But the Pandavas are very strong.  Remember when Arjuna fought a fire god and even beat the king of the gods? Remember when Arjuna saved you from some magical creatures? Your own brothers ran away, but Arjuna rescued you! He even beat all of us in Virata's city, and took our clothes! He beat Drona and me! He even beat Karna and gave Karna's armor to Uttara. He even beat some scary creatures that even the god Indra couldn't beat!  Arjuna is protected by the greatest god of all, who is super strong! You, Duryodhana, are not seeing things clearly.  You're fighting a war you can't win. Fight the Pandavas yourself! I will fight the other warriors, but I won't fight Sikhandin. Sikhandin was born a girl, then became a boy, but that doesn't change who they are. I will not hurt Sikhandin."

Duryodhana listened and went to his tent.  He told his brother Dussasana to protect Bhishma. Duryodhana said, "Bhishma is our best warrior.  We must protect him so he can defeat the Pandavas!"  Duryodhana knew Bhishma wouldn't fight Sikhandin.

The next day, Duryodhana and his army surrounded Bhishma with many chariots and elephants.  Arjuna saw this and told Sikhandin, "Today, you will fight Bhishma, and I will protect you!"  The great battle began!
