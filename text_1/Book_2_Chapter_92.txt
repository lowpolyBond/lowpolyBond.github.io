Prince Bharata had a fun night at the wise man's house.  In the morning, he wanted to see his brother Rama.

He bowed to the wise man, Sage Bharadvaja, who was doing a special fire ceremony.  "Prince," the sage asked, "Did you have a good night? Was everything alright?"

Bharata bowed again. "Yes, thank you! My army and I were very happy.  We slept well and ate delicious food.  We're ready to go see my brother.  Can you tell me how to get to Rama's place?"

The sage smiled. "It's ten miles from here.  Look for Cittrakuta mountain, it's near a field with lots of rocks.  The Mandakini River flows near it.  Rama and his brother Lakshmana live in a small hut by the river, on the mountain." He pointed. "Take the right path south of the Yamuna River. That path will lead you to Rama."

Just then, King Dasharatha's wives arrived.  Kaushalya and Sumitra, very sad, touched the sage's feet.  Kaikeyi, who was upset about what happened, also bowed to the sage. She stood sadly a little away from Bharata.

The sage turned to Bharata. "Prince, I'd like to meet your mothers."

Bharata explained, "This is my father's main queen, Kaushalya, Rama's mother.  She is very sad. And this is Sumitra, Lakshmana's and Shatrughna's mother.  And that's my mother, Kaikeyi. She made a bad decision that made my father very sad and sent Rama away." Bharata's voice was shaky.  He was very upset.

The sage said, "Bharata, don't blame Kaikeyi. Rama's time in the forest will help many people."

Bharata bowed to the sage and thanked him. He told his army to get ready to go.

Soldiers rode horses. Others rode in shiny golden chariots.  Elephants, decorated with flags and bells, walked proudly.  The whole army was magnificent. Bharata, in a beautiful palanquin, led them towards the south.  It was a huge, amazing sight. The army went deep into the forest.  The animals watched in surprise as the army marched on, ready to find Rama.
