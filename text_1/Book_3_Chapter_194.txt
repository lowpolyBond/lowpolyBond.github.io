Once upon a time, there was a king named Yayati.  He was a very kind king. One day, a wise man came to see him.  The wise man needed help for his teacher.

He said, "King, please help my teacher."

King Yayati asked, "How can I help?"

The wise man said, "Kings sometimes don't like people asking for things. But I hope you'll give me something kindly."

King Yayati smiled.  He said, "Iâ€™m always happy to help! I never brag about giving gifts.  And I only give what I can.  I'll give you one thousand cows!"

The wise man was very happy. He thanked the king and took the cows home.  King Yayati was happy too, because he liked helping others.
