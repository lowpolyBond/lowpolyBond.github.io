Once upon a time, long, long ago, a king named Yudhishthira wanted to hear a story.  He asked a wise man named Vyasa, "Tell me about King Marutta!"

Vyasa said, "Long ago, in a time called the Krita age, Manu was the king. His son, Prasandhi, had a son named Kshupa. Kshupa's son was King Ikshwaku.  Ikshwaku had one hundred sons, all very good! They all became kings. The best archer was Vinsa. His son was Vivinsa, who had many sons, all brave and kind.

But Vivinsa's oldest son, Khaninetra, was mean. He was a bad king, so the people took away his kingdom and gave it to his son, Suvarcha.  Suvarcha was a much better king. He was kind and honest. But he was so good, he gave away all his riches!  He became poor.  Other kings started to attack him.

Even though he was weak, Suvarcha was so good that he couldn't be beaten!  He was so good, a magical army appeared to help him! He won the war and became known as Karandhama.  Karandhama's son was even stronger! He was so strong, even the gods couldn't beat him!  His son, Avikshit, was also a very good and powerful king.

Avikshitâ€™s son was King Marutta.  Marutta was the best! He was as strong as ten thousand elephants! He wanted to have a big, special ceremony called a sacrifice. He went to Mount Meru, a huge mountain, and had lots of beautiful golden things made for it.  He and many other kings had a wonderful ceremony there!"
