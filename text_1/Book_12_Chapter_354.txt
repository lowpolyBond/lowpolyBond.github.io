Once upon a time, in a beautiful town near the River Ganga, lived a very good Brahmin man.  He was kind and wise, and he knew the right way to live. He was rich, had a big family, and everyone respected him.  He worked hard and was always fair.

This Brahmin had many children and he wanted to do something very special to honor his family. He thought hard about what he should do.  He knew there were three kinds of good things to do:  things the holy books said, things wise people had done, and things his own family always did.

He wondered, "Which is the best way? How can I be sure I'm doing the right thing?" He was very confused.

Then, another wise Brahmin came to visit.  The first Brahmin was very happy to have a guest and treated him well.  After the guest had rested, the first Brahmin said, "My best years are behind me. I want to do something really good with the rest of my life, but I don't know what!  I'm worried!"

The guest said, "I don't know the answer either! There are so many good things to do! Some people become holy men and live in the forest. Some serve their families. Some are brave warriors and fight for what's right. Some study holy books very hard.  Some are kind and helpful to others. Some tell the truth always. Some are very brave.  There are so many paths to goodness.  It's hard to choose!"

The guest was just as confused as the first Brahmin!  There are many ways to be good, and each has its own rewards.  They both learned that being a good person can take many forms.
