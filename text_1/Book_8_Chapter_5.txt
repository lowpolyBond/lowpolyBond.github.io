King Dhritarashtra was very sad.  He asked his driver, Sanjaya, "So many have died! Tell me who is still alive and who is dead."

Sanjaya said, "Many brave warriors are gone.  Great Bhishma, a powerful warrior, died after fighting for ten days.  Then the strong Drona, another great warrior, also died.  Karna, a very strong fighter, died too.  Many, many others died fighting. Prince Vikarna, your son, fought bravely until he died.  Bhima killed him.  Vinda and Anuvinda, two strong princes, also died. Arjuna killed Jayadratha, a king who ruled many lands. Arjuna's son Abhimanyu's killer, Duryodhana's son, was killed by Arjuna's son,  Arjuna also killed Bhagadatta, a very good friend of the gods.  Many other brave warriors from both sides, including your sons Dushasana, Citrasena, Durmukha, Dussaha, Durmarshana, Durvisaha, and Durjaya, died fighting. Your uncle Bhurisrava, and many other kings and soldiers, died in battle.  Even Karna’s son, Vrishasena, was killed.  Your grandsire, Bahlika, also died, along with thousands of soldiers. Your advisor, Vrishavarman, was killed too.  Many soldiers from many different kingdoms were killed.  Arjuna was a very strong warrior, and he killed many, many people. He even killed Karna, the warrior your side hoped would win the war."

Sanjaya continued, "King, this terrible war happened because of your sons’ bad actions.  They were greedy and unkind, and now this is the result."
