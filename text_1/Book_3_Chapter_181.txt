The Pandavas were living in a new place.  Then came the rainy season!  It was wonderful.  Dark clouds filled the sky and thunder boomed.  Rain poured down day and night.  The sun hid behind the clouds.  Bright lightning flashed instead.  The earth was covered in green grass.  Little bugs and snakes were happy.  The water was everywhere.  You couldn't even tell where the hills and rivers were!

The rivers roared like angry snakes.  Animals made happy sounds.  Peacocks danced, frogs croaked, and birds sang in the rain.  The Pandavas walked through the desert, enjoying the rain.

After the rain, autumn arrived.  The sky was clear, the stars twinkled, and the moon shone bright.  The rivers were clean and clear.  Pretty flowers bloomed in the water.

The Pandavas walked along the Saraswati River.  It was beautiful, full of water, and its banks were covered with tall reeds. They loved the river!

One special night, the full moon shone brightly. The Pandavas spent the night with kind, holy people.  Then, they went deeper into the forest, to a place called Kamyaka.  Their friends, their driver, and their cooks went with them.
