Once upon a time, a kind prince lost his kingdom.  He met a wise sage.  The prince said, "I don't want riches if I have to be unfair to get them. I only want to live a good life."

The sage smiled. "You are a good and honest man," he said. "I will help you."  The sage knew a powerful king, King Janaka, who needed a clever advisor.

The sage went to King Janaka.  He said, "This prince is amazing! He's honest and smart. He's perfect to help you rule!"

The sage told King Janaka how the prince never did anything wrong. He said, "A good king needs a good advisor!  This prince is brave and wise â€“ the best kind of advisor!"  He explained that even though the prince lost his kingdom, he was still a very good person.  He even gave some good advice, like "fighting isn't always the best way to solve problems; sometimes peace is better."


King Janaka listened carefully. He realized the sage was right.  King Janaka was very impressed. He said, "I was tricked into thinking I won.  Actually, *you* won me over with your goodness!  I would be lucky to have such an advisor."

King Janaka invited the prince to live with him. He gave the prince a warm welcome, a beautiful home and even gave him his daughter's hand in marriage! They became the best of friends. The prince was happy, and King Janaka had a wonderful advisor. They all lived happily ever after.
