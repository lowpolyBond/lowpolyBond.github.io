Once upon a time, the good King Yudhishthira was worried.  His cousin Duryodhana, a very bad man, was being mean.  Yudhishthira asked Krishna, a very wise and powerful friend, for advice.

Yudhishthira said, "Krishna, Duryodhana is so bad! He doesn't listen to anyone, not even wise old Bhishma or Vidura! What should we do?  We want to be good, but Duryodhana wants to fight!"

Krishna, in his deep voice, said, "Duryodhana is only interested in winning, even if it's not fair. He’s surrounded by bad advisors like Karna and Sakuni.  He even wanted to put me in jail! He doesn’t care about being good or famous. He thinks he’s already won.  He hates you and wants to fight."

Krishna continued, "Duryodhana is so bad, he's worse than all your enemies put together! We can't make peace; we must fight."

Everyone looked at Yudhishthira. He knew Krishna was right.  He told his brothers, Bhima, Arjuna, and the twins, "Prepare for battle!" The Pandava army cheered!

But Yudhishthira felt sad. He said, "Bhima, Arjuna, this is terrible! We have to fight our elders, the people who taught us! How can we win by hurting them?"

Arjuna remembered what Krishna had said. He reminded Yudhishthira, "Krishna told us the truth.  Wise Vidura and our mother Kunti agreed that we cannot back down. We must fight!"

Krishna agreed with Arjuna.  The Pandavas decided to fight. They were ready for war, and they spent the night feeling hopeful.
