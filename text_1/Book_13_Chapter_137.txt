Yudhishthira, a very good king, asked his grandpa Bhishma, "Grandpa, what's better: giving to others or being good and religious?"

Bhishma smiled.  "Let me tell you some stories, my dear grandson!  Many kings went to heaven because they were kind and generous."

"There was King Sivi. He gave away his own beloved bird to a poor man!  Because of his kindness, he went to a beautiful place in the sky."

"King Rantideva gave lots of gifts to wise people. Because he shared his riches, he also went to heaven."

"King Janamejaya gave away his beautiful jewelry and many cows. He, too, went to live happily in the sky!"

Bhishma told many more stories. There was King Pratardana who gave his son away.  There was Devavriddha who gave away a beautiful umbrella.  There was Amvarisha who gave his whole kingdom!

Each king showed great kindness and generosity.  They helped others, and for that, they were rewarded with a wonderful life after they died.

"All these kings," Bhishma said, "went to heaven because they were kind and gave things away. They also prayed and were good people.  Giving and being good are both very important."

"So, Yudhishthira," Bhishma continued, "being kind and giving things to others helped them go to heaven. It's important to be both kind and religious!"

"It's getting late," Bhishma said, "we can talk more tomorrow."
