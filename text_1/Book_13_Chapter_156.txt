Long ago, there was a big battle between the gods and the demons.  The demons were winning!  Rahu, a mean demon, shot arrows at the sun and the moon.  It got super dark, and the gods couldn't see.

The gods were scared and went to a very wise and holy man named Atri.  Atri was super strong because he prayed and meditated a lot.  The gods begged, "Atri, the sun and moon are hurt!  It's dark, and we're losing the battle! Please help!"

Atri said, "I'll do it!" He used his magic to become the sun and the moon!  He shone brightly, and the darkness disappeared.  The gods were so happy!  Atri was so powerful, he defeated the demons all by himself!

The wind god then told Arjuna another story.  This time, it was about a wise man named Chyavana. The Aswins, twin gods, were not allowed to drink special juice called Soma with the other gods.  Chyavana told Indra, the king of the gods, that the Aswins *should* be allowed.

Indra refused.  Chyavana was very upset.  He used his magic to create a HUGE, scary demon named Mada! Mada was so big, his mouth was like a giant cave!  All the gods were trapped inside Mada's mouth!

Inside Mada's mouth, the gods realized they were wrong.  They told Indra to apologize to Chyavana.  Indra bowed down and said sorry.  Chyavana was happy. He let the gods out of Mada's mouth and allowed the Aswins to drink the Soma juice.

Chyavana told everyone that things like gambling, hunting too much, drinking too much, and spending too much time with women could cause trouble.

The wind god asked Arjuna, "Who's stronger â€“ a warrior king or a wise man with magic?" Arjuna stayed quiet.  He was thinking about the amazing power of these holy men.
