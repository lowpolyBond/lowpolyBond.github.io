King Dhritarashtra asked Sanjaya, his wise advisor, "Sanjaya, you told us a little about the amazing island we live on. Now tell us all about it!  Tell us about the part that looks like a bunny rabbit."

Sanjaya began, "King, imagine six huge mountains stretching from east to west, all the same size.  They reach all the way to the oceans! These are Himavat, Hemakuta, Nishadha, Nila (with blue stones!), Sweta (white like the moon!), and Sringavat (made of all kinds of metal!).  Magical beings live on these mountains.  Between each mountain are huge lands called Varshas, filled with lots of different creatures and kingdoms."

"Our land is in the Bharata Varsha.  North of us is the Himavat Varsha.  Beyond Hemakuta is the Harivarsha. There's another mountain, Malyavat, between Nila and Nishadha.  North of Malyavat is Gandhamadana. Between them is Mount Meru, a giant golden mountain shining like the sun! It's incredibly tall and deep!  It holds up the whole world!"

"Four islands surround Meru: Bhadraswa, Ketumala, Jamvudwipa (that's our island!), and Uttar-Kuru, a land of very good people.  Even the sun, moon, and wind go around Meru!  It's filled with beautiful palaces, amazing fruits and flowers, and happy gods, magical beings, and other creatures all playing together.  Great gods like Brahman and Indra even have parties there!"

"One of the islands, Ketumala, and Jamvudwipa (our island) are on the west side of Meru.  People there live for ten thousand years! They're all healthy and happy, with golden skin!  Even Mount Gandhamadana is full of fun, and people there live even longer â€“ eleven thousand years!"

"Our island, Jamvudwipa, looks like a bunny rabbit! The mountains make its ears and body.  The Ganga River, a very holy river, flows from Mount Meru like a waterfall.  Lord Shiva, a very powerful god, held it on his head for a long, long time!  The Ganga falls into a beautiful lake."

"So, King, that's the story of our amazing world, with its beautiful mountains, rivers, and happy people!"  Sanjaya finished.
