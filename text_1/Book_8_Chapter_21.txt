King Dhritarashtra was worried.  He asked Sanjaya, "Arjuna is so strong!  After Karna killed Pandya, what did Arjuna do?"

Sanjaya said, "When Pandya died, Krishna told Arjuna, 'The other Pandavas are gone!  Karna is hurting our army badly. We need to help them!'"

Arjuna quickly said, "Let's go!"  He and Krishna raced into the battle.  It was a huge fight!  The Pandavas and the Kauravas fought hard.  Karna, a great warrior, was fighting bravely.

The battle was terrible!  Soldiers used swords, spears, arrows, and clubs.  Elephants trumpeted, horses neighed, and soldiers shouted.  Arrows flew everywhere, like a giant rain of sharp sticks.  The noise was deafening!

Karna was amazing.  He killed many Pandava soldiers.  He was strong and fast, like a lion hunting deer.  He hit many soldiers with just one arrow!

But the other Pandavas fought back.  They surrounded Karna, and fought him bravely.  They all fought hard, using all their weapons. The battle was so fierce, many soldiers and elephants and horses were hurt.

It was a terrible, bloody battle.  Many warriors were killed.  The battlefield was covered with broken weapons, dead soldiers, and fallen elephants.  It was a sad and awful sight.  The ground was covered in blood, like spilled juice from a cut tree.  Even the bravest soldiers were scared and tired.
