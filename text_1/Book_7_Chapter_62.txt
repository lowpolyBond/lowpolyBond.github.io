Once upon a time, there was a king named Yuvanaswa.  One day, while hunting, he got very thirsty. He saw smoke in the distance, which led him to a special ceremony.  There, he drank some special butter.  Amazingly, this made him pregnant!

Two special doctors, the Aswin twins, helped deliver a baby boy.  This wasn't just any baby – he was super special! Even the gods helped him.  Indra, the king of the gods, gave the baby milk from his finger, so the baby could grow strong. They named him Mandhatri.

Mandhatri grew very quickly! In just twelve days, he was huge and super strong. He was so strong, he conquered the whole world in just ONE day! He was a very good king, honest and brave.  He fought many battles and won, ruling over all the land between the sunrise and sunset mountains.

King Mandhatri was very generous. He gave huge feasts!  Mountains of food! Rivers of milk and honey! Everyone came to his parties – gods, people, even magical creatures! He gave away tons of gold and other treasures.  He held so many big celebrations, he gave away gifts to everyone.

After a long and wonderful life, King Mandhatri disappeared, just like the sun setting.  He went to a magical place for good kings.  So, don't be sad when people die, especially good people like Mandhatri, who lived a great life and helped everyone!
