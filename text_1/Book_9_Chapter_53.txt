Long ago, in a place called Kurukshetra, there was a king named Kuru.  He was a very good and wise king.  He spent many years plowing a big field.

Some wise holy men, or Rishis, told Rama a story about it.  They said, "King Kuru was working very hard in this field.  Indra, the king of the gods, came down from heaven and asked him, 'Why are you working so hard, King Kuru?'"

King Kuru answered, "Anyone who dies on this field will go to heaven because their sins will be washed away."

Indra laughed. He thought it was silly. He went back to heaven, but King Kuru kept on plowing.  Indra came back again and again, and Kuru always said the same thing.

The gods were worried!  If people just died on this field to go to heaven, nobody would worship them anymore!  So, Indra finally gave Kuru a deal.

Indra said, "King Kuru, stop plowing!  Anyone who dies here fighting a battle, or who dies here after praying and fasting, will go to heaven!"

King Kuru agreed.  So, Kurukshetra became a very special place.  Indra even said, "Even the dust from Kurukshetra can take people to heaven!"  Many, many people came to this special field.  It was blessed by all the gods.

The wise men finished their story by saying Kurukshetra is a sacred place where even kings who die in battle go straight to heaven!  Itâ€™s a super special and holy place!
