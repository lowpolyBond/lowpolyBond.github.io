Bhima was angry.  He told King Yudhishthira, "King, you're like a bubble—here one minute, gone the next! Time keeps moving, like a river rushing to the sea.  Waiting thirteen years is like waiting for death itself! Every moment, we get closer to death. We can't wait!

"We need to fight for our kingdom now!  A warrior who doesn't fight for what's right is weak and useless, like a sick bull. We're strong!  You're a great king! You are rich and famous. Use your power to defeat your enemies! Even if going to battle means facing trouble, it’s better than being weak.

"This waiting is torture! I can't sleep!  Arjun is sad and angry too.  Our mother Kunti and our brothers are quiet, but they want to fight.  Our friends want to fight. Everyone wants to fight!

"If we hide, our enemies will find us.  Lots of kings hate us because we defeated them. They'll help Duryodhana find us. Thirteen months in the forest feel like thirteen years! We should act like warriors, not scared mice!  It’s better to fight and be brave, even if we make mistakes. You should forget the promise and fight!"

Bhima explained that being kind isn't always right.  A strong king needs to protect his people, even if it means fighting.  He said, "Fighting for what’s right is the best thing a warrior can do!"
