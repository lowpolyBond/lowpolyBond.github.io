Once upon a time, in a great battle, two brothers fought!  Sahadeva, a Pandava prince, was very angry.  He shouted and fought against his cousin, Duhshasana, a Kaurava prince.

All the soldiers cheered loudly, waving their clothes. Duhshasana shot three arrows at Sahadeva, hitting him in the chest.  But Sahadeva wasn't giving up! He shot back! He hit Duhshasana with one arrow, then seventy more! He even shot three arrows at Duhshasana's driver.

Duhshasana broke Sahadeva's bow.  Then he shot seventy-three arrows at Sahadeva, hitting his arms and chest.  Sahadeva was furious! He grabbed a sword and threw it! The sword cut Duhshasana's bow and fell to the ground.

Sahadeva got a new bow and arrow.  Duhshasana cut the arrow in half with his sword! Duhshasana threw his sword at Sahadeva, but Sahadeva cut that sword in half too!

Duhshasana then shot many arrows at Sahadeva's chariot. Sahadeva shot five arrows for every one Duhshasana shot, and he broke them all!  Duhshasana shouted really loud!  Then Duhshasana shot Sahadeva and his driver with more arrows.

Sahadeva got really, really angry! He shot one HUGE arrow!  This arrow went right through Duhshasana's armor and into the ground! Duhshasana fainted!  His driver quickly drove him away, while dodging arrows himself.

Sahadeva had won the fight! He was so strong he started to defeat many of the other Kaurava soldiers. He fought them like someone angrily crushes a whole pile of ants!
