King Yudhishthira was very sad.  He was quiet and heartbroken.  A wise man named Vyasa, who lived on an island, came to talk to him.

Vyasa said, "King, you are a ruler. It's your job to protect your people.  People who do what's right are strong. Follow your familyâ€™s example.  Priests pray and do good things. That's their job.  Warriors like you protect everyone and keep the peace.  If someone breaks the rules, even if it's a friend or a holy person, you have to stop them. You must punish bad people.  If you don't, it's wrong. The Kauravas were bad, and you fought them. You did what was right.  Don't be sad!"

Yudhishthira said, "I know you're right, wise one. But I killed many people in the war! It hurts me badly!"

Vyasa said, "Who makes things happen? God? Luck? Or us?  If God makes everything happen, then God should feel bad, not you. It's like cutting down a tree with an axe. The person who swings the axe is responsible, not the axe itself.  If you think everything is just luck, then the war wouldn't have happened.  Look at our holy books. They say kings must punish bad people. Good and bad things go round and round like a wheel. We get what we deserve.  Do good, and avoid bad things. Don't be sad and hurt yourself.  There are ways to make up for what you did. You can still do good things!  Don't die.  Live and do what's right to feel better."
