Once upon a time, a prince named Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandpa, you know everything! Tell me how to be a good person."

Bhishma smiled. "Good people are kind and do good things," he said. "They don't do bad things like being mean or reckless."  He explained, "Good people are also clean and tidy. They don't go to the bathroom in fields or by the road. After using the bathroom, they wash themselves and pray to the sun. They get up early, pray morning and evening, and always face east in the morning and west in the evening when they pray."

"They also eat quietly facing east," Bhishma continued, "and they always wash their hands after eating. They never go to bed with wet feet.  They visit holy places and kind people. They treat everyone the same, even their servants. They eat twice a day – morning and evening, just like the gods. They always share their food."

Bhishma said, "Good people offer gifts to the fire at special times and are faithful to their wives. They respect the leftover food of holy people because it’s very special. They're kind to animals and never hurt them without a good reason. They always make sure their guests have food.  They respect their elders and bow to them."

"Good people never stare at the sun or another person's wife," he said. "They are always polite and say hello to everyone they meet. They use their right hand for eating, praying, and reading holy books.  They always ask if someone has enough food or drink when they give it to them."

Bhishma then said, "Good people are honest and don’t hide their mistakes. Even if no one sees their mistakes, the gods do.  They don't boast about good things they do, because true goodness is quiet. Bad things follow bad things, and good things follow good things, just like day follows night. Being good to everyone is very important."

"Always be kind and good in your heart," Bhishma advised. "You don't need anyone else to be good.  Goodness is the best thing in the world, better than anything else!"  He ended by saying, "Goodness is like magic! It makes you happy here and forever!"
