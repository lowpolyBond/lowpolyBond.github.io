Once upon a time, some beautiful nymphs, called Apsaras, angered a wise holy man.  They were very sorry.  They begged him to forgive them.

The holy man was kind, but he said, "Because of your mistake, you will become crocodiles for one hundred years.  After that, a great hero will save you."  He also said the place where they would live would become very special and holy.

The Apsaras were very sad. They didn’t know how to find this hero. Then, they met a wise and powerful sage named Narada.  He told them, “A brave warrior named Arjuna will save you.  He is in a place near the ocean.”

So, the Apsaras turned into crocodiles and swam to the ocean.  They waited a long, long time.  Finally, Arjuna, a very strong and kind warrior, found them.  He rescued them!  They turned back into beautiful Apsaras.

Arjuna was happy to help.  He let the Apsaras go free.  Then, he went to see his son and Chitrangada, the Apsara he loved.  He had a wonderful reunion with his family. The end.
