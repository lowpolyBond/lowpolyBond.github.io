King Yudhishthira asked his wise uncle, Bhishma, "Uncle, how can a king be a good ruler and be remembered forever?"

Bhishma said, "A good king is fair and kind to his people.  He does what's right, and he'll be happy and famous, both now and later."

Yudhishthira said, "But Uncle,  no one is perfectly good!  How can a king find the perfect helpers?"

Bhishma smiled. "You're very smart, Yudhishthira!  It's hard to find perfect people.  But a good king needs a great team! He should have four wise Brahmins (priests), eight strong Kshatriyas (warriors), twenty-one wealthy Vaisyas (traders), three hardworking Sudras (farmers), and one clever Suta (storyteller) as advisors.  They should all be about fifty years old, honest, and fair.  They should follow the rules of the scriptures, never be greedy, and always be helpful."

Bhishma continued, "The king should listen to his advisors and then tell everyone in his kingdom what they've decided.  He must be fair! He can't take things that belong to others.  If he's unfair, people will be scared, like little birds afraid of a hawk. His kingdom will crumble like a boat in a storm!  Being fair is very important for a kingdom to be strong. Anyone who is unfair, even the king's son or advisors, will go to a bad place after they die. A good king protects the weak from the strong.  When people argue, he listens to witnesses. If someone has no witnesses, the king must be extra careful.  Punishments must fit the crime:  rich people might pay fines, poor people might go to jail, and those who do very bad things might get physical punishment. A good king is kind to good people. But anyone who tries to kill the king, or sets fires, steals, or does other bad things will be punished."

Bhishma explained, "A king who punishes people fairly does good, but one who is unfair will be remembered badly and punished later. Never punish someone for someone else's mistakes.  And, a king must *never* hurt an envoy (messenger).  It's a terrible thing to do! Envoys should be kind, smart, honest, and good speakers. The kingâ€™s bodyguards and city guards should also have these qualities.  The king's advisors must be wise, brave, honest, and able to keep secrets. The army commander must know how to fight and use weapons. He must also be brave and strong. The king must trick his enemies into thinking they are safe, but he shouldn't trust *anyone*, not even his own son!"

Bhishma finished, "The most important secret of being a good king is to not trust anyone completely. I have told you the secrets of good kingship."
