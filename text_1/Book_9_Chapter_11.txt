Once upon a time, in a huge battle, lots of soldiers were fighting.  It was a scary, noisy mess!  Elephants trumpeted loudly, soldiers screamed, and horses ran everywhere.  Arrows flew through the air, and chariots crashed into each other. Brave soldiers fought hard, but scared soldiers hid.  The Pandavas and the Kauravas were fighting each other fiercely, each side killing many of the other side.

Early that morning, the Pandavas, led by their wise brother Yudhishthira, fought bravely. The Kaurava army was scared, like deer running from a forest fire.

Seeing his army losing, King Shalya, a strong warrior, decided to help. He charged into battle, shooting lots of arrows.  The Pandavas fought back, hitting him with their arrows too.  The ground shook!  The sky flashed with bright lights, and even animals seemed scared.  It felt like magic!

Shalya was very strong. He shot so many arrows that thousands of soldiers fell! He even hurt Yudhishthira, Bhimasena, the Pandava sons, and others.  His arrows rained down like a storm!

But the Pandavas were strong too!  They fought back, and many Kaurava soldiers fell.  Shalya kept fighting, even though many warriors came to help the Pandavas.  Kritavarma, Kripa, Shakuni, Ashvatthama, and Duryodhana all joined the fight! They shot arrows at the Pandavas.

Even brave Bhimasenaâ€™s horses were killed! He jumped off his chariot and started fighting with his big club.  Shalya also killed some of the Pandavas' horses.  Sahadeva even killed Shalya's son!  The fight was wild and crazy!

Shalya kept shooting arrows at Yudhishthira. Then Bhima, super strong and angry, picked up his giant club.  It was huge and heavy, like a thunderbolt!  Bhima swung his club and smashed Shalya's chariot. Shalya jumped out and watched Bhima.   Shalya was amazed! The Pandavas cheered for Bhima, their mighty warrior. The battle raged on!
