After the big battle, Yudhishthira felt very sad.  He was heartbroken about Karna's death.  He sighed and spoke to Arjuna, his brother.  "Arjuna," he said, "If we hadn't fought, so many of our family wouldn't have died.  We won the war, but we lost everything important.  Being brave warriors caused this terrible sadness.  Peaceful people who are kind and forgiving are much happier.  We were too proud and greedy. We wanted to rule the whole world, and look what happened!  We killed so many of our own family, it hurts more than losing the whole world could ever hurt. It was like dogs fighting over a bone, and now we don't even want the bone anymore. We shouldn't have fought for anything, not even for all the gold in the world!  Our family fought and died because of greed and anger.

Their parents had hoped for great things for their sons. They worried about their sons' safety and happiness. Now their dreams are broken because their sons are gone.  Those young men, so strong and handsome, are dead. They didn't get to enjoy life or give anything back to their parents and the gods.  They were always wanting more, and always angry.  Because of that, they never really won anything.

The Kuru and Panchala kings who died were good people. The bad people, the ones who started the war, were the sons of Dhritarashtra. Duryodhana was sneaky and mean. He lied and tricked us, even though we never did anything wrong to him. We both lost. We didn't win, and they didn't win either.  Duryodhana was so jealous of us. He was so angry, he couldn’t enjoy anything—not his kingdom, his treasures, or even his family.  His father, Dhritarashtra, knew Duryodhana was bad, but he didn't stop him. He listened to his son, instead of his wise advisors. Dhritarashtra and Duryodhana brought this sadness on themselves and everyone else. Duryodhana was cruel.  He even said awful things to our family.  Because of his actions, our whole family is gone. It's all his fault!

We've done wrong, and we must pay for it. We can make things better by being good. We need to be kind, give to others, and pray.  The best way to be truly happy is to leave the world behind.  Arjuna, I'm going to live in the forest, far away from all this. I'll be peaceful and quiet. You can rule the kingdom now.  I don't want anything anymore."  And with that, Yudhishthira stopped talking. Then Arjuna spoke.
