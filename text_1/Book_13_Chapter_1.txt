Once upon a time, after a terrible war, King Yudhishthira was very sad.  His grandfather, Bhishma, was badly hurt and dying. Yudhishthira felt terrible because the war was his fault. He said, "Grandfather, I feel so guilty!  Seeing you like this, covered in blood and wounds, breaks my heart. So many good people died because of me.  Even my enemies are gone. What will happen to us now? I don't deserve to live!"

Bhishma, wise and kind, told Yudhishthira a story.  It was about a woman named Gautami whose son died from a snake bite.  An angry hunter caught the snake and wanted to kill it.

"Kill it!" he shouted to Gautami. "It killed your son!"

But Gautami said, "No.  Everything happens for a reason.  Killing the snake won't bring my son back."

The hunter disagreed.  He thought revenge would make him feel better.  He argued with Gautami, but she stayed calm.

Then, the snake spoke!  It said, "I didn't choose to bite the boy.  Death sent me.  It's not my fault."

The hunter then argued with Death itself.  Death explained that even *it* wasn't really in charge.  A bigger power, called Kala, controlled everything â€“ even Death!  Kala said that the boy died because of his own past actions, his own karma.

Finally, Kala, Death, and the snake all left.  Gautami felt peaceful because she understood.  The hunter also felt better.

Bhishma told Yudhishthira, "Just like the boy, everyone's life is ruled by karma.  You and Duryodhana didn't create the war; Kala did. It was already decided. You shouldn't blame yourself."

Yudhishthira felt much better after hearing the story. He understood that even though terrible things happened, it wasn't entirely anyone's fault.  He finally found peace.
