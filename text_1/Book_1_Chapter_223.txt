Once upon a time, Arjuna, a brave warrior, took a princess named Subhadra away.  Some people were upset.  Arjuna's uncle, Vasudeva, said, "Arjuna didn't dishonor us.  He made us proud!  We're not the type to sell anyone. Arjuna did what he thought was right, and Subhadra is a wonderful girl."  Everyone agreed, and they all went to get Arjuna.

Arjuna happily returned to Dwaraka and married Subhadra.  He stayed there for a whole year, and then he went back home.  Arjuna's wife, Draupadi, was a little jealous at first, but she forgave him.  Subhadra was very kind and respectful. She bowed to Kunti (Arjuna's mother) and Draupadi.  Everyone was happy!

Later, Krishna, Subhadra's brother, and many other important people visited Arjuna's city to celebrate. They brought lots of gifts:  gold, horses, cows, even beautiful servant girls!  Krishna gave many gifts to the Pandavas and Subhadra.

Subhadra had a baby boy! They named him Abhimanyu. He was a strong and brave boy, just like his father.  Draupadi also had five sons, one with each of the Pandava brothers.  All the children grew up to be very brave and strong warriors.  Everyone lived happily ever after!
