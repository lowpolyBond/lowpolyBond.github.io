Satyaki was angry.  He said, "Your words show what's in your heart!  There are brave people and scared people.  It's like a tree with some branches that have fruit, and some that don't.  Even brothers can be very different.  I don't blame you for what you said, but I blame the people listening to you! How can anyone blame good King Yudhishthira?  Clever people tricked Yudhishthira at dice. He wasn't good at the game, and they cheated!  If they'd played fairly, that would be different.  But they tricked him!  Yudhishthira did everything they asked. He went to the forest. He deserves his kingdom back. Even if he wanted their things, begging isn't right!  They say the Pandavas were seen in hiding, but that's not true.  Bhishma and Drona asked them to give back the kingdom, but they refused!

I'll fight! I'll use my arrows!  I'll make them bow down to Yudhishthira! If they don't, they'll die!  No one can beat me, Arjuna, Bhima, or the twins!  Who can fight Dhrishtadyumna, the Pandava sons, Abhimanyu, or the other strong warriors? We'll fight Dhritarashtra's son, Sakuni, and Karna! We'll put Yudhishthira back on his throne!  It's not wrong to kill those who want to kill us. Begging is wrong!  Help Yudhishthira get his kingdom back!  Today, Yudhishthira gets his kingdom back, or I will kill all our enemies!"
