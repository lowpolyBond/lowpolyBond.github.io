Once upon a time, in a shallow lake full of yummy fish, lived three friendly Sakula fish.  One fish was very smart and always planned ahead. Another fish was quick-thinking and clever.  The third fish was a procrastinator – he always put things off!

One day, fishermen came and started draining the lake! The smart fish saw the danger.  "We need to leave!" he said to his friends. "The lake is getting empty! Let's swim to a new lake before it's too late!"

The procrastinating fish said, "Yeah, yeah… later.  No need to rush."

The quick-thinking fish said, "I always act when I need to!"

The smart fish didn't wait. He swam away to a safe, deep lake.

The fishermen finished draining the shallow lake. They caught almost all the fish! The procrastinating fish was caught.

The quick-thinking fish was also caught! But he was clever.  He pretended to be caught, and when the fishermen put the fish in a bucket to wash them, he wriggled free and escaped!

The procrastinating fish wasn't so lucky. He was too slow and was eaten by the fishermen.

Bhishma, a wise man, told this story to teach us a lesson.  He said, "Planning ahead and being quick-thinking are very important.  Don't put things off! The procrastinating fish learned the hard way."  He added that even the quick-thinking fish faced danger; however, clever planning and quick wits can often save the day.  It's best to be both smart and prepared!
