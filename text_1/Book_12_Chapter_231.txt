Once upon a time, in the land of the Mahabharata, a wise king named Yudhishthira asked his grandpa, Bhishma, a very important question.  "Grandpa," he said, "I want to know everything about how the world began and how it will end! I want to know how long things last, and how time works."

Bhishma smiled. "That's a great question, my boy!" he said. "I'll tell you a story that my grandpa, Vyasa, told his son, Suka, a long time ago."

Suka had asked Vyasa the same thing. "Father," he'd asked, "who made everything, and what are the rules for good people to follow?"

Vyasa, who was very, very wise, said, "There is only one creator, Brahma, who is always there, without a beginning or an end.  He's like the sun, always shining."

Then Vyasa explained how time works. "Tiny bits of time add up," he said.  "Lots of tiny blinks make a small moment. Lots of small moments make a bigger moment. Lots of bigger moments make a day. Days make months, and months make years."

Vyasa explained that there are different kinds of years.  For us, it's simple. But for gods and other beings, a day or year is much, much longer.  He talked about four ages of the world: the Krita Yuga, the Treta Yuga, the Dvapara Yuga, and the Kali Yuga.

Each age is a different length of time, and things change in each age. In the first age, everything was good, people lived for a long, long time, and everyone did what was right. In each age after that, things got a little bit harder and life got a little shorter.  The best way to live also changed.

Vyasa said that a huge amount of time makes up a single day for Brahma.  When Brahma is awake, the world exists. When Brahma sleeps, the world ends.  Then Brahma wakes up again and the world starts all over!

So, Yudhishthira learned all about how the world began, how time works, and how things change over a very, very long time.  It was a very long story, but a very important one.
