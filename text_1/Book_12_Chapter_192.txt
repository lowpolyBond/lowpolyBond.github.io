Once upon a time, a wise man named Bhrigu told a story about holy people called forest hermits.  These hermits lived simply in the woods.

They slept on the ground.  They ate only berries, roots, and leaves. They didn't wear fancy clothes. They didn't cut their hair or nails.  They were very, very patient. They prayed and did special rituals.  They were kind and didn't hurt anyone. By being so good, they made their hearts pure and got to go to a wonderful place after they died.

Bhrigu then talked about traveling holy people called Parivrajakas.  They didn't care about riches or fancy things. They treated everyone the same – rich or poor, friend or foe. They didn't hurt any living thing, big or small. They wandered everywhere, sometimes sleeping under trees, sometimes near temples. They only stayed a few nights in towns and villages, asking only for a little food. They were always kind and thoughtful.

Another wise man, Bharadwaja, wanted to know about a special place. Bhrigu told him about a beautiful land far away, to the north. This was a magical land with happy people.  No one was sick or mean. Everyone was kind and happy, and they lived long, healthy lives.  There was no fighting or sadness.

Bhrigu explained that in our world, some people are good and some are bad. Some are rich, some are poor. There’s a lot of sadness and fighting.  But if we try to be good and kind, like the hermits and traveling holy people, we can also live happy lives and go to that beautiful land after we die.  Being kind and gentle is like magic!  It helps us to have a good life here and a wonderful life later.

Then Bhishma, a great warrior, told the King this whole story. He asked the King if he wanted to hear more.

The end.
