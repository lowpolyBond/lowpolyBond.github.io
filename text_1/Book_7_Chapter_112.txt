Once upon a time, in a great battle, Satyaki, a super-strong warrior, fought for the Pandavas.  He was so brave!  He wanted to get to Drona's chariot, so the Pandavas all helped him.  "Let's help Satyaki get through!" they shouted.

Satyaki was amazing! He shot arrows like a storm!  He hit so many enemy soldiers that they ran away!  The ground was covered with broken chariots, fallen soldiers, and even dead elephants! It looked like a messy battlefield.  No one dared to fight him.

Satyaki was so powerful, people saw many of him, even though he was just one warrior! He fought his way through lots of enemies and then tried to follow his friend Arjuna's path.

But then, Drona, a very powerful warrior, stopped him!  They fought a huge battle, shooting arrows at each other.  Satyaki shot seven arrows, and Drona shot back! Then Satyaki shot even more!

Drona shouted angrily, “Your teacher, Arjuna, ran away! If you don’t run too, you’ll die!”

Satyaki said, "I'm following my teacher's path, just as a student should."  He bravely went around Drona.

Satyaki's chariot driver said, "Look!  There's Karna's army! Let's go through the gap between the other armies to reach them!"

Satyaki went through the gap. Drona chased him, shooting arrows. Satyaki fought bravely against Karna's army, and his enemies ran away.  

But then, another strong warrior, Kritavarman, came to fight Satyaki. They shot so many arrows at each other! Kritavarman hit Satyaki, breaking his bow.  But Satyaki got a new bow and shot even more arrows. He even cut off Kritavarman's chariot driver's head!

Kritavarman's horses ran off, but he stopped them and kept fighting. Satyaki went on to fight other soldiers, but lots of warriors stopped him. Then Drona came back and the battle went on and on.  The Pandavas bravely fought back, even though it was hard!
