Once upon a time, in a great battle, a brave warrior named Bhishma was hurt.  He was lying on the ground, surrounded by arrows.  Arjuna, another brave warrior, saw Bhishma's pain.  Bhishma asked Arjuna, "Arjuna, my head hurts. Can you help me?"

Arjuna, very sad, said, "Of course, Grandsire!" He took his special bow and arrows.  He carefully used three arrows to make a soft pillow for Bhishma's head.

Bhishma smiled. He said, "Thank you, Arjuna.  A warrior should sleep on a bed of arrows like this on the battlefield. I will rest here until the sun moves to a certain place. Then, I will leave this world."  He asked everyone to dig a ditch around him and to stop fighting.

Then, some healers came to help Bhishma. But Bhishma said, "No thank you.  I have fought bravely.  I do not need your help." The healers went away.

Everyone was amazed by Bhishma's courage.  The soldiers from both sides, even though they were enemies, showed Bhishma respect.  They bowed to him and stayed with him to guard him.  Then, everyone went to their tents to rest.

Later, Krishna, a wise and powerful friend of Arjuna's, came and talked to Yudhishthira, the leader of Arjuna's side.  Krishna said, "You won the battle! It was fate that Bhishma, who was almost unbeatable, was defeated."

Yudhishthira happily replied, "This victory is all thanks to you, Krishna!  You protect us, and because of you, we are safe and victorious."  Krishna smiled. He knew Yudhishthira was right.
