Once upon a time, a wise man named Kalakavrikshiya visited King Kshemadarsin.  The king's advisors were stealing money from the kingdom!  But how could the king know?

Kalakavrikshiya had a clever plan. He carried a caged crow.  He told everyone, "My crow knows the past, present, and future! It understands the secrets of crows!"  Then he traveled the kingdom.  He watched the advisors.

His "crow science" was a trick.  It helped him find out the truth. He saw the advisors were stealing! He went to the king.

"Your advisors are stealing!" he said.  "My crow told me!"

The advisors were angry.  That night, while Kalakavrikshiya slept, they hurt his poor crow.

The next morning, the sad wise man went to the king. "King," he said, "I need your help! Your advisors are bad! They are stealing your money!"

The king was worried. "Tell me what to do!" he said.

Kalakavrikshiya explained.  He said kings need to be careful who they trust.  Advisors can be like poisonous snakes.  They can look friendly but secretly cause harm.

He told the king to be like a wise driver, guiding his kingdom carefully. He warned him that even though it's sad, sometimes bad people will try to hurt those who try to help. The King should choose his friends and enemies wisely and should not blindly trust anyone.

The king listened.  He fired the bad advisors.  He made Kalakavrikshiya his top advisor.  With the wise man's help, the king ruled wisely and fairly.  The kingdom became strong and prosperous!  The king learned that listening to wise people and being careful who you trust is very important.  And the crow? Well, even though it suffered, it helped save a kingdom!
