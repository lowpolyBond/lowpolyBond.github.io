Once upon a time, the good gods were losing a big fight against some bad guys called Asuras.  The Asuras took all the gods' stuff!  The gods were sad and wandering around.

Then, they met a super-powerful priest named Agastya. He was so bright and strong, like the sun! The gods asked Agastya for help.  Agastya was very angry at the Asuras.  He was so powerful, he shone like a giant fire!  The Asuras started to burn up and fall from the sky! They ran away to hide.

Even though Agastya defeated most of them, some Asuras hid underground. The gods asked him to finish them off, but Agastya said it would make him less powerful.  Even so, he had already defeated most of the Asuras with his amazing power!  The gods were very happy.

Another time, the gods were doing a special ceremony by a lake.  Some giant, scary Asuras called Khalins wanted to hurt them. These Asuras were super strong, and even when they were hurt, they got better right away! They were splashing around in the lake, making huge waves.

The gods were scared, even their leader, Indra!  They asked another powerful priest, Vasishtha, for help. Vasishtha was very kind. He used his magic to make the Khalins disappear! Then, he magically made a river appear, cutting right through the lake!  The gods were safe!

Bhishma told Arjuna these stories.  He wanted to show Arjuna how powerful priests could be â€“ even more powerful than any warrior!  Arjuna was quiet, thinking about how amazing these stories were.
