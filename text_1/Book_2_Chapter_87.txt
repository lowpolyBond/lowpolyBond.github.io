Bharata heard Guha's story about his brother, Rama.  Rama was strong and handsome, like a lion, but very sad inside.  He fainted!

Bharata's brother, Shatrughna, cried and hugged him.  Bharata's mothers, who were very thin from worrying, rushed to him.  Queen Kaushalya, Bharata's mother, held him close.  She was worried sick!  "My son," she cried, "are you alright?  Our whole family depends on you!  Rama and Lakshmana are in the forest.  What happened?"

Bharata woke up. He comforted his mother and asked Guha, "Where did Rama sleep? What did he eat?"

Guha, the king of the Nishadas, happily told him. "I gave Rama lots of food, but he only ate a little. He said, 'We are warriors. We give, we don't take!'"

Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana slept on the ground.  Lakshmana made a bed of grass for Rama and Sita. He even washed their feet! Then he stood guard all night, protecting them with his bow and arrows.  Guha and his men also kept watch.  "And, Prince," Guha said, pointing, "that's the tree, and that's where they slept!"
