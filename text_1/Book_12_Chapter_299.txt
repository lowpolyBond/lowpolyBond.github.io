King Janaka of Mithila had a question. He asked the wise Parasara, "What makes us happy? What's the best way to live? What good things last forever? And where can we go so we never have to come back?"

Parasara smiled.  "Being kind and not wanting too many things is the start of happiness," he said. "Learning is the best path.  Good deeds, like helping others, never disappear.  And if you're kind to everyone, even animals, you'll be safe and happy. Giving gifts is also good, like giving food to those who need it."

"It's like this," Parasara explained. "Smart people aren't bothered by bad things.  But people who are greedy can easily get into trouble.  Bad things always catch up to you eventually.  But people who are very good and believe in goodness, don’t have to worry about bad things happening to them."

He continued, "If you're always kind and calm, you won't get into trouble, even if you have lots of nice things. It's like a dam holding back a river.  A strong, good person is like that dam, strong and never breaking."

"Being good is like a special jewel that shines brighter when you’re around good people," Parasara said. "If you want to go to heaven, you need to let go of things you want too much – like toys or even your friends."

"It's like a fish chasing a tasty worm," he said. "If you only want things, you'll miss what's really important. We all need each other, like parts of a body.  We’re all connected, and death comes to everyone. So always be kind and good. Death waits for no one!"

"Being good is like a blind man carefully walking through his house," Parasara explained.  "Even without seeing, he knows his way around.  A wise person knows the right path, even if it’s hard to see."  He added, "We're born, and we die. But good people find happiness in this life and the next."  Being unselfish makes us happy. It's like a lotus flower growing out of the mud – it leaves the mud behind and becomes beautiful.


"Your mind can help you be good," Parasara said.  "And being good brings happiness.  People who only think about themselves and their things will be unhappy."

"Everything good or bad that happens to you comes from what you did before," Parasara explained.  "Good deeds are like investments that pay off, and bad deeds have consequences. So always try to be good."  

King Janaka listened carefully. He was very happy to hear this wise advice.  He knew exactly what to do.
