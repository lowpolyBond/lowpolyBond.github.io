Once upon a time, there was a kind king. He promised to give a special gift to a holy man, a Brahmin. The king's wife, Queen Kunti, was very respectful of holy men.  The king asked Kunti to take care of the Brahmin.

Kunti said, "Don't worry, King! I will take good care of him. I love to serve holy men. It's very important to me." She promised to serve him well, no matter what time of day or night he arrived. She knew that making holy men happy brought good luck, and making them angry brought bad luck.  She remembered a story about a king who angered a Brahmin and had bad things happen because of it.

The king was happy. He hugged Kunti and told her exactly what to do. He also gave Kunti his daughter, Pritha, a young girl, to the Brahmin. He told the Brahmin, "Pritha is still young. Please be kind if she makes a mistake."

The Brahmin said, "Of course, your Majesty."

The king gave the Brahmin a beautiful room, a special seat, and lots of delicious food.  Kunti worked hard to make the Brahmin happy. She served him as if he were a god.  She was kind and hardworking, and the Brahmin was very pleased.
