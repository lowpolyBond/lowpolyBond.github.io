One night, during the great Kurukshetra war, the Pandavas and Kauravas fought again.  Both armies were excited!  Just as the sun started to rise, painting the sky orange and red, the soldiers bowed to the sun.

Then, Drona, the Kaurava leader, and his army attacked the Pandavas.  Krishna, Arjuna's friend, told Arjuna, "Keep your enemies to your left, and attack Drona's army on your right."  Bhima, another Pandava brother, told Arjuna, "Arjuna, it's time to fight!  Show your strength and win!"

Arjuna, a very strong warrior, fought bravely. He faced Drona and Karna, two great Kaurava fighters.  He shot so many arrows that the sky filled with dust, and it got dark and noisy.  The soldiers couldn't see each other, so they fought by guessing who was near!  Many horses and chariots crashed together.

Then, Drona moved to another part of the battlefield. He looked strong and powerful, like a fire that doesn't smoke.  The Pandavas got scared when they saw him.  Many Kaurava soldiers felt afraid, but some were angry and fought hard.

Drona was very strong.  He quickly killed three of Drupada's grandsons and many other soldiers. Drupada and Virata, two brave Pandava leaders, tried to fight Drona, but he was too powerful. Drona even broke their bows!  He killed Drupada and Virata too.

Dhrishtadyumna, a Pandava general, was very sad and angry that Drona had killed so many people. He promised to kill Drona himself!  He attacked Drona, but Drona's friends, Duryodhana, Karna, and Sakuni, protected him.

Bhima saw Dhrishtadyumna was having trouble and yelled at him, "Fight, Dhrishtadyumna! Drona is like a fire, burning our army!" Then Bhima and Dhrishtadyumna attacked Drona together. The fighting was fierce and terrible, like nothing anyone had ever seen before!  Finally, the sun rose fully, and the battle raged on.
