Once upon a time, there were four brothers who lived in a forest.  Their names were Jaritari, Sarisrikka, Stamvamitra, and Drona.  The youngest brother, Drona, was very smart.

One day, a giant, fiery god named Agni came to burn down their home!  The brothers were scared.

Jaritari, the oldest, said, “When we die, it’s best to be brave and ready.”

Sarisrikka said, “Only one person can be brave and wise in times of trouble.”

Stamvamitra said, “The oldest brother should protect us, but if he can't, what can we do?”

Drona, the cleverest, said, "The fire god is coming! He has seven mouths and is very strong!"

The brothers were very worried.  They each prayed to Agni.  Jaritari called Agni the soul of the air and the body of plants.  He said Agni was powerful like the sun.

Sarisrikka asked Agni for help. He said, "We are young and have no one to protect us but you."

Stamvamitra said, "Agni, you are everything! You made the whole world, and you keep it going."

Drona prayed, "You, Agni, help us digest our food.  You bring rain and make plants grow. Please don’t burn us!  Please go another way!"

Agni heard Drona’s wise words. He remembered a promise he’d made to their father.  He said, "Drona, you are a wise one. I will not harm you.  But there are some nasty cats in this forest that are causing trouble.  You can ask me to burn them instead!"

Drona said, “Please, Agni, burn those mean cats and their friends!”

So, Agni, the fire god, listened to Drona and burned the cats instead of the brothers' home. He left the brothers’ home safe but burned down the rest of the forest. And that’s how the forest of Khandava was burned!
