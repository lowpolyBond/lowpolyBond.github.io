Satyaki, a brave warrior, fought bravely in the great battle. He had just defeated many enemies.  He told his driver, "We fought through a huge, scary battle! It was like crossing a stormy ocean filled with arrows and swords!  But now, the rest of the enemy army looks easy to defeat. Let's go!"

Satyaki was looking for his friend Arjuna. He knew he was close.  He wasn't afraid of all the enemies, even though there were many. They were like dry grass to a big fire – easily burned!  He could see where Arjuna had been fighting.  The ground was covered with dead soldiers and horses.  The enemy army was running away, kicking up a cloud of dust.  Satyaki could hear Arjuna’s bow, the Gandiva,  twanging – the sound he knew so well. He was sure Arjuna would win soon.

Satyaki’s driver said, "I'm not scared! I'm safe with you! You've already defeated so many enemy soldiers.  I've never been scared in battle before!"

Satyaki said, “I will defeat these enemies quickly!  I promised to help my friend Arjuna.  King Duryodhana will be very sad when he sees me fight. I want to show everyone how well my teacher, Arjuna, trained me!" He wanted to show everyone his strength and bravery.

Then Satyaki and his driver raced towards the remaining enemy soldiers.  The enemies, who were called Yavanas and Kamvojas, threw many arrows at Satyaki. But Satyaki was quick! He shot his arrows and cut down many enemy soldiers. He fought so bravely that the enemies ran away.  Everyone watching was amazed.  Even the magical singers and musicians praised him!  Satyaki was on his way to help Arjuna.
