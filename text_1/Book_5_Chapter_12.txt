Once upon a time, a powerful king named Nahusha became very angry.  He wanted Indra's wife, Sachi.  The gods were worried.  Nahusha was so angry that the whole world shook!

The gods begged Nahusha to calm down. They said, "King, please don't be angry!  Sachi is someone else's wife. It's not right." But Nahusha wouldn't listen. He said, "Indra, the king of the gods, did bad things too!  Why didn't you stop him?"

The gods were sad. They went to Vrihaspati, a wise teacher, who was protecting Sachi. They asked him to give Sachi to Nahusha.

Sachi cried. She begged Vrihaspati to help her.  Vrihaspati was a good man. He said, "I will never give someone who asks for my protection to their enemy! It's not right." He explained that helping Nahusha would bring bad luck.

The gods were clever.  They suggested that Sachi ask Nahusha for time to decide.  Vrihaspati agreed.  This gave them a chance to make a plan.

The gods then whispered to Sachi, "You are very important.  Go and talk to Nahusha.  He's bad, and soon he'll lose his power. Then Indra will be king again!"

Sachi, feeling scared but brave, went to Nahusha.  Nahusha, still very angry and wanting Sachi, was happy to see her.  This is how Sachi saved herself, and Indra got his kingdom back.
