King Dhritarashtra was a wise king, but he was also blind.  Sanjaya, his advisor, told him about the Pandavas and the Kauravas, who were about to go to war.  Dhritarashtra thought hard about who would win.

He saw that the Pandavas, the five brothers, were very strong.  They had magical help from the gods! Arjuna, one of the Pandavas, was especially powerful.  He had a super-strong bow and arrows.  He could shoot hundreds of arrows at once, faster than anyone could see!

Dhritarashtra worried about his sons, the Kauravas. They weren't as strong as the Pandavas.  He knew that Arjuna was almost unbeatable.  He thought the gods would help the Pandavas because the Pandavas were good.  The gods remembered how Arjuna helped them before.

Dhritarashtra was very worried.  He couldn't sleep! He was afraid his sons would be defeated and even killed.  He loved his sons very much. He said to his son Duryodhana, "I'm so scared!  The Pandavas are much stronger.  We need peace, not war! We should make peace with the Pandavas."  He believed the Pandavas would win the war. He wanted peace more than anything.
