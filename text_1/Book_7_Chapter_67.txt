King Rantideva was a very, very generous king. He had so many cooks – two hundred thousand! –  to feed all the guests who came to his palace.  He gave them delicious food, day and night.

He gave away all his riches to wise people called Brahmins. He was a brave warrior who won many battles.  He loved to do special ceremonies called sacrifices, and even animals seemed to want to be part of them!  So many animals were sacrificed that the leftover skin made a whole river!  It was called the Charmanwati River, the "Skin River."

King Rantideva gave away so much gold! He always said, "I give you gold! I give you gold!" He gave away tons and tons of it.  Even after giving away a huge pile of gold in one day, he thought it wasn’t enough! He always wanted to give more.  People said his whole kingdom was made of gold!  He gave away golden bulls, cows, and more gold to the Brahmins every two weeks for a hundred years!  He even gave away his furniture, houses, and everything else he owned.

One night, even though he fed twenty-one thousand cows to his guests, his cook still had to shout, "Eat all the soup you want! We ran out of meat today!"  King Rantideva even gave away his last bits of gold. The gods themselves would come down to take the offerings he made!

King Rantideva was a truly great king, always doing good and giving everything he had. Even when he died, everyone remembered his kindness.  He was much better than anyone who doesn’t give to others.
