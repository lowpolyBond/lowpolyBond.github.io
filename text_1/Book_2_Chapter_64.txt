King Dasaratha was very sad.  He had accidentally killed a young holy man, a sage's son. He felt terrible.

He told Queen Kaushalya, "I went to the sage's home.  His parents were old and weak, like birds without wings. They were waiting for their son to bring water.  Seeing them made me even sadder."

The sage's father said, "Son, why are you late?  Your mother is worried."

King Dasaratha was scared, but he told the truth.  "I'm not your son," he said. "I'm King Dasaratha. I was hunting. I heard a sound, thought it was an animal, and shot an arrow.  I killed your son by mistake."

The sage didn't curse him right away. He said, "King, you told me the truth. That saved you.  If you hadn't, I would have cursed you!"

The sage and his wife went to see their son's body.  They cried and cried. The father said, "My son, who will help us now? Who will read to us? Who will get our food?"

The wise holy man's son went to heaven. He told his parents, "I'm here, and you'll join me soon."  Then the sage and his wife made a fire and went to be with their son.

The sage's wife cursed the king.  She said, "You made me sad, so you will be sad too. You'll lose your son."

King Dasaratha remembered this, and he was very, very sad.  He was dying. He said, "I miss my son Rama so much! I want to see him before I die. But it's too late.  I did not treat Rama kindly. My cruel wife Kaikeyi sent him away. Oh, Rama, my son, where are you?"

King Dasaratha cried and cried, then he died. He died because he was so sad about his son.
