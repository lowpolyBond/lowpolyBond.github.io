Once upon a time, during a great war, a brave warrior named Satyaki saw Somadatta, a bad guy from the Kaurava army, aiming his big bow.  Satyaki told his driver, "Take me to Somadatta! I won't come back until I defeat him!"

His fast, white horses, as quick as the wind, zoomed towards Somadatta. Somadatta shot many arrows at Satyaki, like rain from a dark cloud.  Satyaki fought back bravely, shooting arrows too.  They both shot so many arrows that they looked like beautiful flowers covered in raindrops!

They were so good at fighting that they looked like two porcupines, covered in arrows!  Then Somadatta,  using a sharp arrow, broke Satyaki's bow.  Satyaki got a stronger bow and shot back!  He even cut Somadatta's flag!

They kept shooting arrows at each other.  Then, another strong warrior, Bhima, helped Satyaki. Bhima shot arrows at Somadatta, but Somadatta fought bravely.  Finally, Satyaki aimed carefully and shot a powerful arrow that broke Somadatta's bow and killed his horses!  With one last arrow, he defeated Somadatta!

After Somadatta died, many Kaurava warriors attacked Satyaki.  Meanwhile, another battle was happening. Yudhishthira, a good king, was fighting Drona, a powerful teacher. They shot many arrows at each other. Drona broke Yudhishthira's bow, but Yudhishthira quickly got a new one and fought back fiercely!  He shot many arrows at Drona's horses and chariot.

Drona was hurt and angry. He used a special weapon, but Yudhishthira stopped it with his own special weapon!  Yudhishthira was very brave and strong.  Krishna, a wise advisor, told Yudhishthira to stop fighting Drona and join Bhima in another part of the battle.  Yudhishthira listened and went to help his brother.  That night, Drona and his army continued to fight.
