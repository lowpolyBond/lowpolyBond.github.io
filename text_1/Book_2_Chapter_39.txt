King Dasharatha was very sad.  He saw Rama, his son, dressed like a holy man.  The king fainted!  His wives cried.  He woke up and cried, "I must have done bad things in my past life!  That's why this is happening.  Kaikeyi is making me send Rama away!"  He was heartbroken.

He told Sumantra, his friend, "Get the best chariot ready. Take Rama out of the city."  Sumantra quickly got the beautiful chariot ready.

The king also told his treasurer, "Get Sita, Rama's wife, beautiful clothes and jewels.  She'll need them in the forest." Sita got dressed in her finest clothes.  She looked like the morning sun!

Queen Kaushalya, Rama's mother, hugged Sita.  She said, "Many wives leave their husbands in trouble. But you, Sita, are different.  You are good and loyal.  Don't blame my son. He's like a god, whether rich or poor."

Sita said, "I'll always be with Rama.  A wife needs her husband like a lute needs strings.  He's like a god to me."  Queen Kaushalya felt better.

Rama said to his mother, "Don't be sad, Mother.  Fourteen years will pass quickly.  I'll be back soon!"

Rama also spoke to the other queens.  He said, "If I did anything wrong, please forgive me."  The queens cried. The palace, usually full of happy sounds, was now filled with sad cries.
