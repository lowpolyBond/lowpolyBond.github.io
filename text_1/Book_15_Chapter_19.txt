King Dhritarashtra was very sad.  Wise Vidura told him to go to a special place by the Bhagirathi River.  It was a holy place, perfect for quiet and thinking.

Many people went to see the king â€“ priests, warriors, farmers, and everyone else.  The king talked with them and made them happy. He even gave the priests and their students gifts.

That evening, the king and Queen Gandhari went into the river to wash and be clean.  They prayed.  Kunti, who was like a daughter-in-law to Gandhari, helped them out of the water.

Priests had built a special fire for the king.  He offered prayers to the fire.  Then, the king, Gandhari, and their friends went to Kurukshetra.

They went to see a wise king named Satayupa, who used to rule a big kingdom but now lived in the forest.  Satayupa welcomed them.  Then, they all visited the great sage Vyasa.  Vyasa taught the king how to live simply in the forest.

The king and queen went back to live with Satayupa.  They learned to live a simple life.  Gandhari and Kunti wore simple clothes made of tree bark and animal skins.  They prayed and practiced being good.

King Dhritarashtra became very thin from all his praying and fasting. His hair grew long and wild.  Vidura and Sanjaya, his loyal friends, also lived simply, showing they were also sad and sorry. They all wanted to make up for their mistakes.
