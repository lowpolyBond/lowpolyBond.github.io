The Kauravas were very happy to see Alayudha, a powerful warrior, join their army.  They were like people lost at sea who suddenly found a life raft!  They felt like they were reborn.  Everyone welcomed Alayudha.

Meanwhile, there was a big fight between Karna and Ghatotkacha, a giant.  It was a scary but exciting battle to watch.  But the Pandava army was scared!  They cried out, "We're going to lose!" They were worried about Karna.

Duryodhana saw Karna was in trouble. He told Alayudha, "Karna is fighting Ghatotkacha.  Please help him!  Don't let Ghatotkacha kill Karna!"

Alayudha attacked Ghatotkacha.  They fought like two angry elephants!  Karna was safe now. He rushed to fight Bhima.

But then, Bhima saw Ghatotkacha struggling against Alayudha.  Bhima went to help.  He and Alayudha fought fiercely! Other giant warriors joined the fight against Bhima.  Bhima was strong, and he defeated them all!

Alayudha fought back bravely.  They hit each other with arrows and then with big maces!  The ground shook with every blow!  They fought with everything they could findâ€”even their chariot wheels! They were covered in blood, like two angry elephants fighting.

Krishna, a wise friend of the Pandavas, saw Bhima was in danger.  He told everyone what to do.  He sent Ghatotkacha to help Bhima.  Alayudha even broke Bhima's chariot!  But Bhima was tough. He kept fighting!  He jumped off his broken chariot and kept fighting with his mace. The fight was very, very fierce!
