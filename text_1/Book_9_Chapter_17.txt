Once upon a time, during a great battle, a mighty warrior named Shalya fought bravely.  He was the king of Madra.  He was strong! He had a powerful bow.

Shalya hurt Yudhishthira, the Pandava king, with many arrows.  He was like a lion, roaring as he shot!  He also hurt many other brave warriors.  He even broke their chariots and killed their elephants and horses.

The Pandavas and their friends were angry.  They surrounded Shalya.  Bhima, the strongest Pandava, and Nakula and Sahadeva, Madri's sons, all fought Shalya together. They rained arrows upon him!

Yudhishthira, protected by his brothers, shot Shalya in the chest.  Then Shalya fought back hard! He shot Yudhishthira with many arrows.  They shot arrows at each other like two angry tigers! It was a big, loud battle!

Shalya shot so many arrows that he broke Yudhishthira’s bow! Yudhishthira got a new, stronger bow.  They kept shooting until Yudhishthira’s arrows broke Shalya’s bow too!

Bhima then broke Shalya’s bow. Bhima hit Shalya with more arrows. He even cut off Shalya's chariot driver’s head!  Then he hit Shalya's horses, one by one.

Shalya jumped from his chariot and fought with a sword and shield.  But Bhima was too strong. He broke Shalya's shield and sword.  Other Pandava warriors joined the fight.

Shalya was surrounded.  He was tired and hurt.  Yudhishthira threw a magical spear, a very special weapon. The spear flew through the air, shining brightly!  It hit Shalya right in the chest.  Shalya fell to the ground, like a giant tree falling down.

Shalya’s younger brother saw this and wanted revenge! He fought Yudhishthira, but Yudhishthira was too clever and strong. He quickly killed Shalya's brother.

Seeing their kings defeated, the Kaurava army was scared. They ran away! The Pandavas cheered, and the sound of their horns and drums filled the air. The battle was almost over.  Shalya, the brave king, was defeated.  The Pandavas had won!
