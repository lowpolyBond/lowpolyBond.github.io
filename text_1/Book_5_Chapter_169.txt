Once upon a time, in the great war of the Mahabharata, a wise old warrior named Bhishma talked to Karna, a brave but boastful warrior fighting for the Kauravas. Bhishma said Karna was a good fighter, but not as great as he thought.  He said Karna was only half as strong as a top warrior because of some bad luck and curses.

Karna was furious! He yelled at Bhishma, calling him mean and unfair.  Karna said Bhishma was just jealous and trying to make him look bad. He boasted about his own strength, saying he could defeat the Pandavas all by himself!  He even said he wouldn’t fight until Bhishma was gone.

Bhishma, though very old and powerful, calmly replied. He reminded Karna of his past boasts and said he just wanted Karna to fight bravely and be a true warrior. He pointed out Karna’s arrogance and told him to prove his strength against the strongest enemy warrior.

Then, King Duryodhana, who was Karna’s friend, stepped in. He told Bhishma and Karna that he needed them both. He wanted to know the strengths and weaknesses of their enemies to win the war.  He knew they both were important, even if they didn't always agree. The great war was about to begin!
