King Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandpa, how do I choose the right priests to honor at our special family ceremony?"

Bhishma said, "When you give gifts to priests, you shouldn't be picky.  It's like giving gifts to the gods! Just give to everyone."

But, Bhishma explained, at the special family ceremony, you should choose carefully. "Look at their family, their age, how they behave, and how much they know.  Some priests are good, and some are not so good."

Bhishma listed some bad priests:

* Priests who are sneaky or liars.
* Priests who hurt unborn babies.
* Priests who are sick with a wasting disease.
* Priests who own animals.
* Priests who don't know the holy scriptures.
* Priests who work as servants.
* Priests who lend money and charge interest.
* Priests who sing for money.
* Priests who sell things.
* Priests who start fires to hurt others.
* Priests who poison people.
* Priests who help people do bad things.
* Priests who sell special drinks for ceremonies.
* Priests who tell fortunes by looking at your hands.
* Priests who work for the king.
* Priests who sell oil.
* Priests who cheat and lie.
* Priests who fight with their fathers.
* Priests who let their wives have other lovers.
* Priests who have been cursed.
* Priests who steal.
* Priests who make things with their hands.
* Priests who pretend to be someone else.
* Priests who are two-faced and mean.
* Priests who are mean to their friends.
* Priests who cheat on their wives.
* Priests who teach bad people.
* Priests who fight.
* Priests who hunt with dogs.
* Priests who have been bitten by a dog.
* Priests who get married before their older brothers.
* Priests who have had a special cut made on their bodies.
* Priests who are disrespectful to their teachers.
* Priests who act in plays.
* Priests who make money from gods.
* Priests who study the stars.

Bhishma said, "If you give gifts to these bad priests, it's like feeding the gifts to scary monsters instead of your ancestors!"

He also said that if a priest eats the special food and then studies the holy scriptures or does something wrong, it makes his ancestors sad.

Bhishma then explained that giving gifts to certain types of priests is like throwing the gifts in the garbage! It's useless.

Then Bhishma said, "Here are the *good* priests!"  He listed good priests:  

* Priests who are kind and know the holy books.
* Priests who have studied and followed the rules.
* Priests who are good people.
* Priests who are very wise and knowledgeable.
* Priests who have been taught the holy books for many years and also teach others.
* Priests who are respectful to their parents.
* Priests who are faithful to their wives.
* Priests who are pure and holy.
* Priests who help others.
* Priests who have traveled far to holy places and bathed in sacred waters.
* Priests who are forgiving and calm.
* Priests who are truthful.


Bhishma said giving to good priests is like planting a seed that grows and grows!

Giving to bad priests is like planting a seed on a rock â€“ nothing grows!


Bhishma said, "So, always choose your priests carefully! Only invite good priests to your ceremony. Don't invite your friends, invite the holy priests!"  That way, your ancestors will be happy!
