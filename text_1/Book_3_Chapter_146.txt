Once upon a time, the mighty Bhima, a strong Pandava prince, met a big monkey blocking his path.  Bhima, proud and brave, asked, "Who are you, and why are you a monkey?"

The monkey smiled. "I'm a monkey, and you can't pass," he said. "Go back, or you'll be sorry!"

Bhima, even stronger than the wind-god (because his father was the wind-god!),  said, "Move! I won't be stopped!"  The monkey replied, "I'm too sick to move.  Just jump over me."

But Bhima said, "I know a great power, the Supreme Soul, and I can't disrespect it by jumping over you. Only if I didn't know this power would I jump, like *another* monkey jumped over the ocean!"

The monkey was curious. "Who jumped over the ocean?" he asked.

Bhima explained, "My brother Hanuman! He's the strongest monkey ever, famous for helping Lord Rama save his wife Sita.  Hanuman jumped the whole ocean to find her! I'm as strong as him, so move!"

The monkey chuckled.  He looked weak and old, so Bhima thought, "I'll just pull his tail and throw him aside."  Bhima grabbed the tail with one hand, then both, and pulled with all his might! He couldn’t even budge it! His face turned red, he sweated, and he couldn’t move the tail.

Finally, Bhima gave up.  He bowed down and said, "Please forgive me!  Are you a god or something amazing?"

The monkey, who was actually Hanuman, answered, "I am Hanuman, son of the wind-god, just like you! I'm here because..."  And Hanuman told Bhima the whole story of how he helped Rama rescue his wife, Sita, who had been kidnapped by the evil Ravana.  Bhima was amazed and humbled.  He finally understood why he couldn’t move Hanuman's tail!
