King Yayati wanted to find a husband for his daughter, Madhavi.  He took her to a special place where the rivers Ganga and Yamuna meet.  Madhavi's brothers, Puru and Yadu, went with them.

Lots of people were there!  Nagas (snake people!), Yakshas (magical beings!), animals, birds, and even forest creatures!  Wise men called Rishis were in the woods nearby.

Madhavi had to choose a husband. But instead of picking one of the many princes, she chose the forest!  She left and became a hermit.  She ate only grass and drank pure water. She lived like a deer, being very good and kind.

King Yayati lived for a very, very long time. His sons Puru and Yadu had many, many children and grandchildren.  Yayati went to heaven and was very happy.

But one day, Yayati became proud. He forgot to be humble and respectful to the gods and other heavenly beings.  The gods noticed.  They asked, "Who is this man? We don't know him!"  Because Yayati was proud, his heavenly glory disappeared! He lost his special place in heaven.
