It was still dark outside, but almost dawn.  Musicians started playing beautiful music to celebrate Prince Bharata.  Big drums boomed, horns blew, and lots of instruments played.

But Bharata was very sad.  He told them to stop.  "I'm not the king!" he cried.  He talked to his brother, Shatrughna. "This music is wrong!  Our stepmother, Queen Kaikeyi, has been unfair.  Our father, the king, is dead.  She sent our brother Rama away to live in the forest!" Bharata felt like their kingdom was a ship lost at sea without a captain.

The palace women heard Bharata crying and they started to cry too.  Then, a very wise and important man, Sage Vasishtha, arrived. He was like a magical teacher to the royal family.  He sat on a beautiful golden throne.  He told some people, "Go quickly!  Get all the important people â€“ the wise men, the soldiers, the leaders, and the princes!  We have a big problem to solve!"

Lots of people came rushing in, riding horses, elephants, and in chariots.  When they saw Bharata, they were so happy. He looked so much like their beloved King Dasaratha, his father.  The palace felt bright and wonderful, just like it did when King Dasaratha was alive.  It was like the ocean sparkling with whales, crocodiles, pretty shells, and golden sand.
