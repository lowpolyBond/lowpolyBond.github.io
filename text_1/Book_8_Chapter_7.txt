King Dhritarashtra was very sad.  Many of his best warriors were dead.  He asked his friend Sanjaya, "With Bhishma and Drona gone, what is the point of living?  Even Karna is dead! Who is left?"

Sanjaya said, "Don't worry, King!  Some brave warriors are still fighting for you!  There's Aswatthama, Drona's amazing son, a super-strong archer.  Kritavarma, a powerful warrior, is still there, too.  Shalya, a very strong warrior, is also fighting. He's even as strong as the god Indra!  The King of Gandhara is also there, along with many of his soldiers.  Gautama, a skilled warrior, is still fighting bravely.  Your son Purumitra is also fighting very hard. And Duryodhana himself is leading the charge!"

Sanjaya continued, "Duryodhana's brothers, Sushena and Satyasena, are also there. Many more brave soldiers are fighting, like Citrayudha, Srutavarman, and Jaya. The Kaitava king is still bravely fighting.  Srutayu, Srutayudha, Citrangada, and Citravarman are also fighting hard.  Even Karnaâ€™s son, Satyasanha and his other sons are still fighting."

Sanjaya said, "Many, many strong warriors are still fighting for you, my King! Duryodhana is fighting like a mighty god, ready to win!"

Dhritarashtra said, "Thank you, Sanjaya.  But it sounds like my army is very small now. It looks like the Pandavas will win."

Hearing this bad news, King Dhritarashtra felt very, very sad.  His heart ached, and he fainted! He woke up a little and said, "Wait!  This terrible news is making me weak."  Then, the king fainted again from sadness.
