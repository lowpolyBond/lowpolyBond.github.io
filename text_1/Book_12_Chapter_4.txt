Once upon a time, Karna got some awesome weapons!  He was very happy and spent his time with his friend Duryodhana.  There was a big party in a faraway city called Rajapura.  Lots and lots of kings were there to choose a princess to marry!

Duryodhana and Karna went in a shiny golden chariot.  Many strong kings were there – Sisupala, Jarasandha, and many more! They all wanted to marry the princess.

The princess went around, looking at all the kings. But she didn’t choose Duryodhana!  Duryodhana was very angry.  He didn't care about the other kings. He grabbed the princess and took her away in his chariot!

Karna, strong and ready for a fight, followed right behind. He was a great warrior with a sword and armor.  All the other kings got mad! They shouted, "Fight! Get ready!"  They threw arrows like rain from the clouds!

But Karna was super-skilled! With just one arrow at a time, he knocked all the other kings' bows to the ground.  Some kings ran away, some tried to fight back, but Karna was too strong! He even made their chariot drivers fall down.

The other kings, sad and defeated, rode away. Duryodhana and Karna, protected by Karna's amazing skills, happily went back to their city with the princess.  They had won the day!
