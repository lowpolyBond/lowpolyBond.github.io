Once upon a time, a great king named Vasu was very, very good. He worshipped God all the time.  But one day, he fell from the sky!  He even went underground!

Why?  Well, there was a big argument. The gods said sacrifices should use goats.  But wise people, called Rishis, said, "No! We should use plants and seeds!"

They all went to ask King Vasu, who was super-rich and kind.  He was a good judge, they thought.  The gods wanted him to say goats were okay.  King Vasu, wanting to please the gods, said, "Use goats!"

The Rishis were very angry!  "Because you chose wrong," they said, "you will fall from the sky and live underground!"  And *poof!*  King Vasu fell down a hole!

But the gods felt bad.  King Vasu was so good! He was still devoted to God, even underground.  The gods helped him. They said, "The butter offered in prayers will be your food!"

So, King Vasu lived happily, eating magical butter in his underground home.  He kept praying to God.  God, seeing his devotion, sent a giant bird named Garuda to rescue him!

Garuda flew down, picked up King Vasu, and zoomed him back up to the sky!  King Vasu was back in heaven! He learned that even good people make mistakes, but being kind and faithful to God always helps.  And that's the story of King Vasu!
