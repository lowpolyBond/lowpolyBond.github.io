Rama and his brother Lakshmana saw Bharata in the forest. Bharata was wearing simple clothes, like a holy man.  "Bharata," Rama asked, "why are you here?  Why did you leave your palace and come to the forest?"

Bharata was sad. He explained, "My father, the king, died of sadness.  My mother Kaikeyi made him very upset. She did something wrong.  She's very sad, too.  The people want you to be king, Rama.  They asked me to bring you back." Bharata bowed low. "You are the eldest brother. You should be king. Please, come back!"

Rama hugged Bharata. "Bharata," he said gently, "You are a good person.  But don't say bad things about your mother.  We must always obey our parents. My parents sent me to the forest. I have to obey them."

Rama smiled. "You should be king, Bharata.  The people want you.  I will stay in the forest for fourteen years. That's what my father wanted."

Bharata was still sad, but he understood. He knew Rama was a good and kind brother. He went back to the city, ready to be king. Rama stayed in the forest, remembering his father's wish.
