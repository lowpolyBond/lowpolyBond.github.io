Arjuna felt sad and didn't want to fight.  He said he didn't want to kill anyone.

But Bhima was angry!  "Arjuna," he roared, "You're talking like a peaceful monk!  Warriors protect people! We were treated badly!  They took our kingdom! They even insulted Draupadi! We were forced to live in the forest for thirteen long years!  You've forgiven them, but I haven't! I'm going to kill those bad guys myself!"

Bhima was a strong warrior.  He boasted, "I can smash mountains! I can defeat armies of gods and demons!  Don't worry about Drona's son. I'll take care of him!"

Then, another warrior, the king's son, spoke up. "Arjuna, I killed Drona. He wasn't a good person. He was a warrior who used magic tricks to fight.  He even hurt our family. Killing him was right.  Drona's son is angry, so what?  It's a warrior's duty to fight and sometimes die fighting.  Drona was our enemy. I've done nothing wrong."

He continued, "My family has been enemies with Drona's family for a long time. Everyone knows that.  Arjuna, don't be sad. Let's fight and win!"  He said that he forgave Arjuna for his words because of Draupadi and her children.  "Let's fight now!" he finished.
