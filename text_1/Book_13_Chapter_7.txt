Yudhishthira, a very good king, asked Bhishma, a wise old warrior, "What happens when we do good things?"

Bhishma smiled.  "I'll tell you a secret," he said. "Everything you do has a result.  If you think good thoughts, you'll have good dreams. If you do good deeds, good things happen to you, even after you die!  It's like planting a seed – you get a plant later.  Your actions follow you, like a shadow."

He explained, "Being kind is very important.  If you help travelers with food, a warm place to sleep, and kind words, you'll be rewarded. If you share your food with someone who's hungry, that’s great! Sleeping on the floor shows you're humble, and you'll get a comfy bed later. Wearing simple clothes?  You'll get beautiful clothes later. Helping others is like magic!"

Bhishma continued, "Being brave and honest brings good things.  Always speak the truth.  Kindness to your parents and teacher brings blessings, too.  The opposite is also true—bad actions bring bad results. Lying is like planting a weed."

He told Yudhishthira about many ways to be good:  sharing food, helping guests, being brave, telling the truth, being kind to your parents and teachers.  He also said that even small things, like taking care of your body, matter.


Bhishma's words amazed everyone. They were all happy to hear such wise advice.  Vaisampayana, who was telling the story, asked Yudhishthira, "Is there anything else you want to know?"
