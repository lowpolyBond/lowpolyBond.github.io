Once, during the big battle, Drona's son saw Duhsasana, a prince and a strong warrior, running away!  "Why are you running?" he shouted. "You're a prince!  You should be fighting! You even said mean things to Draupadi, calling her a slave and saying her husbands were weak.  Why are you scared now?  Even Satyaki, just one warrior, is making you run!  Remember the dice game? You should have known those dice would bring bad luck! You hurt the Pandavas and Draupadi, and now you’re running away?"

Duhsasana didn't answer. He just kept fighting.

Meanwhile, Drona, a super strong warrior, fought the Pandavas. He was so powerful, he was beating them badly!  Viraketu, a prince, fought back bravely. He shot lots of arrows at Drona, even hitting Drona’s flag!  But Drona was too strong, and he shot Viraketu down!

Viraketu’s brothers were very sad. They all fought Drona together, shooting many arrows like a big summer storm.  Drona was strong, but they were many. Drona was so angry, he knocked their chariots over and cut off their heads.

Dhrishtadyumna, another brave prince, was furious! He saw his brothers fall. He rushed at Drona, covering him in arrows.  Drona didn't even flinch; he just kept smiling and fighting!  Dhrishtadyumna jumped from his chariot onto Drona’s, ready to attack, but Drona fought back with short, strong arrows.  Dhrishtadyumna jumped back onto his own chariot and they fought some more! It was an amazing battle, like a storm! Everyone watched them fight.

Then Drona cleverly cut off Dhrishtadyumna's charioteer's head. Dhrishtadyumna's horses ran away, and Drona won that fight. He pushed the Pandavas and their friends back.  The Pandavas were too afraid to fight Drona again.
