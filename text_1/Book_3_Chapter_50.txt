King Janamejaya asked, "Dhritarashtra, the king, was so sad after sending the Pandava brothers away.  Why did he let his son Duryodhana make them so angry? And what did the Pandavas eat in the forest?"

Vaisampayana answered, "The Pandavas were strong and brave. They hunted deer with their arrows and shared their food.  First, they gave food to the priests, then they ate.  Many, many priests lived with them.  Yudhishthira, the eldest brother, took good care of everyone. He made sure everyone had enough to eat.  They never went hungry!  Draupadi, their wife, cooked for everyone. She fed her husbands and the priests first, and then she ate.

Yudhishthira, Bhima, Nakula, and Sahadeva went hunting every day to get meat.  Yudhishthira went east, Bhima went south, and the twins, Nakula and Sahadeva, went west and north. They were very good hunters!

They lived in the Kamyaka forest for five years. They missed Arjuna, but they spent their time studying, praying, and doing religious ceremonies."
