The great battle was about to begin!  Sanjaya told King Yudhishthira what was happening.

Yudhishthira told his army, "Fight bravely and fairly, my friends!  Let's win and go to heaven!"

Sikhandi and his soldiers were in the middle of the army, protected by the mighty Arjuna.  Dhristadyumna led the front lines, protected by the strong Bhima.  The brave Yuyudhana, a great warrior, protected the southern side.

Yudhishthira sat on a beautiful chariot, shining with gold and jewels.  A big white umbrella shaded him.  Wise priests walked around him, praying for his victory.  They gave him blessings and wished his enemies would lose.  Yudhishthira gave gifts to the priests – cows, fruits, flowers, gold, and clothes.  He was generous and kind, like a king of the gods.

Arjuna's chariot was amazing! It had a hundred bells and was pulled by white horses.  It shone brightly, like a thousand suns.  Arjuna, with his powerful bow Gandiva and many arrows, stood ready to fight. He was the best archer in the world!

Bhima, super strong and brave, was ready to fight too. He could crush enemies with his bare hands!  He was like a roaring lion, and the enemy soldiers were scared.

Krishna, Arjuna's friend and charioteer, pointed to Bhishma, the leader of the Kaurava army.  “See him? He’s the one we must defeat. He’s strong and surrounded by many brave warriors, but we will win!” Krishna told Arjuna.  The battle was about to begin!
