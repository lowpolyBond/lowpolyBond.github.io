Once upon a time, a wise man named Javali tried to convince Prince Rama to give up his promise to live in the forest.  He said, "Rama, don't go!  Staying here would be much better!"

But Rama said, "No!  My father asked me to go, and I promised.  That's very important.  It's wrong to break a promise."

Rama explained that being truthful and doing what's right is the most important thing.  He said, "Being good and honest brings happiness, not just here, but in heaven too!  Good people are respected, and bad people are feared, like a scary snake."

He said that following the rules and being honest is like the foundation of a house â€“ everything is built on it.  It's how we get to heaven.  He said, "Even the gods and wise people value truth more than anything."

Javali tried again, but Rama stood firm. He said, "If I don't keep my promise, then everyone will break their promises.  A king must be honest, because everyone copies the king!"

Rama reminded Javali that he had promised his father to go to the forest and that making his stepmother, Queen Kaikeyi, sad was also wrong.  He wanted to keep his promises to everyone.

Javali finally admitted, "I tricked you, Rama! I pretended to not believe in heaven to test you. I wanted to see if you were strong enough to keep your word."

Rama, even though Javali had tricked him, was happy to learn that Javali was truly a good person who believed in truth.  Rama learned a very important lesson that day about the power of keeping your word. And he went to live in the forest, a good and honest prince.
