Galava was very sad.  A wise man named Viswamitra had asked him to do something important, but Galava couldn't do it! He felt terrible. He couldn't eat, sleep, or even sit still. He was so worried, he looked skinny and pale!

He cried, "Where will I find the money?  How will I get eight hundred white horses?  I can't enjoy anything anymore! I don't even want to live! I'll go far away and die! What good is life without friends and money?"

He felt awful because he couldn't keep his promise. He knew that being dishonest was bad. He thought, "A dishonest person has no happiness, no good things, and no friends. I'm a bad person!"

Then Galava decided to ask for help. He wanted to see Lord Vishnu, a powerful god, and Lord Krishna, who is very kind. He thought they could help him.

Just then, his friend Garuda appeared! Garuda was a giant bird, strong and kind. He said, "Galava, my friend!  I've already talked to Lord Vishnu, and he'll help you!  Come on, I'll take you wherever you need to go!"

Garuda offered to carry Galava anywhere he wanted to go. Galava was very happy!  His friend had helped him. He would get the chance to keep his promise after all.
