King Dhritarashtra was sad. He asked his advisor, Sanjaya, "Sanjaya, how do you know Krishna is the greatest of all? I don't understand."

Sanjaya said, "King, you don't know because you don't have the right knowledge. I do. I know Krishna is the creator of everything! He is the beginning and the end of everything."

Dhritarashtra asked, "Sanjaya, how do you know so much about Krishna?"

Sanjaya answered, "I don't chase after things of this world. I focus on being good and learning from the holy books. That's how I know."

Dhritarashtra said to his son, Duryodhana, "Duryodhana, be friends with Krishna! Sanjaya is a good friend. Ask Krishna to help us."

But Duryodhana said, "Even if Krishna killed everyone, I wouldn't ask him for help!"

Dhritarashtra sighed. "My son is stubborn and mean. He ignores everyone's advice."

His wife, Gandhari, added, "Duryodhana, you’re foolish! You are ignoring your father and me!  One day, you will regret it!"

Vyasa, a wise man, then spoke, "Dhritarashtra, you are Krishna’s friend. Sanjaya can help you. Listen to him, and he will keep you safe. People often get into trouble because they always want more.  Be wise, like the wise people, and you will be happy."

Dhritarashtra asked Sanjaya, "Sanjaya, how can I become friends with Krishna?"

Sanjaya explained, "You must control your mind and your senses.  You must stop wanting things you don't need.  True wisdom comes from controlling yourself and being kind.  Krishna is only found by those who have learned to control themselves."
