Garuda, a super strong bird, flew to see his mom, Vinata.  Vinata was sad.  She had lost a bet and was now a servant to Kadru, the snake mom.

Kadru told Vinata, "Carry me to a beautiful place in the ocean where the Nagas live!" Vinata, carrying Kadru on her shoulders, and Garuda carrying the baby snakes on his back, flew towards the sun.

Oh no! The sun was so hot! The baby snakes fainted!

Kadru was scared. She begged Indra, the king of the gods, for help.  She said, "Oh great Indra, you're so powerful! You defeated Vritra and Namuchi!  You control the rain and the storms! Please save my children!"

Kadru praised Indra a lot. She said he was the sun, the wind, the rain, and everything else amazing in the world!  She said he was the best god ever!

Indra, hearing her prayers, sent rain to cool the snakes.  And that's how the snakes were saved.  The end of that part of the story.
