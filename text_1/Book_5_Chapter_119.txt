Galava was on a mission for his teacher, Viswamitra. He needed to get eight hundred special horses.  He found six hundred, but was still short!

Garuda, a powerful bird, saw Galava looking sad.  "Don't worry," Garuda said. "You can't get the other two hundred."

Garuda explained what happened:  A long time ago, a wise man named Richika wanted to marry a princess.  Her father wanted a thousand special horses as a gift. Richika got them, but then a king used them for a big party and gave them away!  The three kings Galava had asked for horses had bought those very horses!  The rest of the horses were lost in a river!

Garuda had a clever idea. "Give Viswamitra the six hundred horses," he said. "And give him the princess you were going to give him as payment for the other two hundred. Then you'll be finished!"

Galava liked the idea.  He took the princess and the horses to Viswamitra.  "Here are six hundred horses, and this princess is worth the other two hundred," Galava said. "The princess already has three sons, and you can have a fourth!"

Viswamitra was happy.  He took the princess and had a son with her. He named the boy Ashtaka. Then he gave Ashtaka the six hundred horses.

Galava was relieved!  He said goodbye to the princess, thanked Garuda, and went to live in the forest.  The princess went back to her father, happy that her sons had saved her family and Galava!
