Once upon a time, in the land of Bharat, a wise king named Yudhishthira asked his grandfather, Bhishma, a very strong and knowledgeable warrior, a big question.  He wanted to know about the very first creators of the world, called Prajapatis, and the great wise men, called Rishis.

Bhishma smiled. "Listen carefully," he said. "It all began with one great being, Brahman, who was powerful and magical. Brahman had seven amazing sons: Marichi, Atri, Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, and Vasishtha.  These were like super-powerful creators!

From these sons, many more Prajapatis were born.  There was Daksha, who was also called Kasyapa, and Kasyapa had many, many children!  One Prajapati, named Sasavindu, had so many sons and grandsons that they filled the whole world!

Then, Bhishma talked about the Adityas, twelve powerful gods like the sun god and Indra, the king of the gods. He also spoke of the Ashwins, twin gods who were healers, and many other gods and goddesses.  All these gods and goddesses had different jobs in making the world work!

Next, Bhishma told Yudhishthira about the seven great Rishis.  These were super-wise men who lived in different directions.

The seven Rishis in the East were Yavakriti, Raivya, Arvavasu, Paravasu, Ausija, Kashivat, and Vala.  They were like super-wise teachers!

In the South lived other Rishis like Unmucha, Vimucha, and Agastya.

In the West, there were Rishis like Upangu, Karusha, and Saraswata.

And finally, in the North, lived the famous Rishis like Atreya, Vasishtha, Kasyapa, Gautama, Bharadwaja, Viswamitra, and Jamadagni.

Bhishma said, "These Rishis are everywhere, watching over us.  If you say their names, your bad feelings will go away!"  He explained that by remembering them, everyone could feel better and happier.  And that was the end of the story.
