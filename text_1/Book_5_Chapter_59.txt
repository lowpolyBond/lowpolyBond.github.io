King Dhritarashtra was worried. He asked Sanjaya, his wise advisor, "Tell me what Krishna and Arjuna said! I'm very anxious."

Sanjaya said, "I went to see Krishna and Arjuna. They were in a beautiful room.  They were relaxed and happy.  Abhimanyu and the twins weren't there. Krishna and Arjuna were sitting on a fancy golden seat, all dressed up and wearing flower garlands.  Krishna’s feet were resting on Arjuna's lap, and Arjuna's feet were on Krishna and Satyabhama’s laps!  Arjuna offered me a golden footstool to sit on. When he moved his feet, I saw special markings on his soles.  They were so strong and tall, like big trees! I was a little scared; they seemed like gods!  Duryodhana, who relies on Drona, Bhishma, and Karna, doesn't understand how powerful they are.  I knew then that Yudhishthira would win, with Krishna and Arjuna on his side.

After I ate and drank with them, I told them King Dhritarashtra's message. Arjuna then asked Krishna to speak. Krishna sat up straight and tall, like a king!  He spoke calmly but his words were serious. He said, ‘Tell Dhritarashtra and the other Kuru elders to celebrate with their families. But warn them – great danger is coming!  They should give to the poor, raise good sons, and be kind to loved ones, because Yudhishthira is ready to fight! We have not yet settled our debts. You have made enemies of Arjuna and me. Who would dare fight Arjuna with me by his side?  Arjuna is incredibly strong and skilled. Nobody can defeat him!  Remember what happened in Virata's kingdom? Arjuna alone defeated your entire army!  Arjuna has strength, speed, and courage unlike anyone else.’

Then Arjuna, looking very strong and proud, agreed with Krishna."
