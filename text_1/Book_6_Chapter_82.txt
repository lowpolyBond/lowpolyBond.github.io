Once upon a time, in a great war, Grandpa Bhishma was talking to Duryodhana, the prince of the Kauravas.  He said, "Duryodhana, don't worry!  Lots of strong warriors are fighting for you!  There's Drona, Salya, Kritavarman, Aswatthaman, and many more kings and soldiers with powerful elephants and horses. We have a HUGE army, strong enough to fight even the gods!"

But Bhishma was honest. He said, "The Pandavas, your cousins, are also very strong. They have Krishna on their side, and they are amazing fighters.  I'll do my best to help you win, but it will be a tough fight."  Then Bhishma gave Duryodhana a special medicine to heal his wounds.

The next morning, Bhishma organized the Kaurava army. It was a fantastic sight!  The army was set up in a special formation, with lots of chariots, elephants, horses, and soldiers.  For every elephant, there were seven chariots; for every chariot, seven horses; for every horse, seven archers; and for every archer, seven shield-bearers!  It was a massive army!  Duryodhana looked magnificent on his chariot.

Then, the Pandavas also organized their army.  Both sides were ready to fight!  The battle began!

The brave warriors fought hard!  Arjun fought many kings. Bhima fought hard too. Abhimanyu fought bravely against many enemies.  Many other warriors from both sides battled.  Arjun was so angry he shot many arrows!  The arrows flew everywhere, like rain!  Everyone was amazed at the fighting. Even the gods were watching!  The battle was furious.  Many soldiers were hurt.  They ran to Bhishma for help.  The Kaurava army was in a terrible mess.  It looked like a stormy sea!
