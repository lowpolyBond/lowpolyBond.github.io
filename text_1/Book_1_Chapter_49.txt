King Janamejaya wanted to know how his father, King Parikshit, died.  He asked his advisors to tell him everything.

The advisors said, "King Parikshit was a great and good king. Everyone loved him. He was fair to everyone, rich or poor, big or small. He was brave and strong, and he learned how to fight from a great teacher. He ruled for sixty years."

Janamejaya said, "I know he was a good king. But how did he die? Tell me everything!"

The advisors explained, "Your father loved to hunt. One day, he shot a deer and followed it into the forest.  He was old and tired, and he got lost. He was very hungry. He found a wise holy man, a Rishi, who was very quiet and peaceful.  The Rishi was taking a special silent vow â€“ he couldn't speak. Your father asked him where the deer went, but the Rishi didn't answer.  Your father got angry. He thought the Rishi was ignoring him. In his anger, he picked up a dead snake and put it on the Rishi's shoulders."
