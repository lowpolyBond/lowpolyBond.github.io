Once upon a time, after some important people left, Arjuna, a brave warrior, thought about Indra's amazing chariot.  Suddenly, whoosh!  A shining chariot zoomed into view! It was pulled by thousands of golden horses, super fast!  The chariot was full of cool stuff:  sharp swords, powerful weapons, and even flying darts!  Huge, fiery snakes were there too, along with piles of white stones.

A friendly driver named Matali hopped off. "Hello, Arjuna! Indra, the king of the gods, wants to meet you. He sent me for you!" Matali explained. "Indra, your father, wants all the gods to see you!  He's waiting with many other important people."

Arjuna was amazed!  "This chariot is incredible!" he said. "Only the most special people can even *see* it, let alone ride it!" He politely asked Matali to get on first.

Matali did as Arjuna asked. Arjuna then took a bath in the Ganges River, said his prayers, and offered water to his ancestors. He also said goodbye to a big mountain he loved. He thanked the mountain for all the fun he had there.  Then, he climbed onto the incredible chariot!

Whoosh! Up, up, up they soared!  Arjuna couldn't see the ground anymore. He saw thousands of other amazing chariots!  The sky glowed with its own light, brighter than any sun or moon!  He saw sparkling stars, which were actually places where good people lived.  He saw brave heroes, wise people, and beautiful magical beings.  He even saw Airavata, Indra's four-tusked elephant, who was as big as a mountain!

Matali explained that all these lights were homes for good people.  Finally, they arrived at Amaravati, the amazing city of Indra!  Arjuna had made it to heaven!
