Once upon a time, a wise teacher named Yajnavalkya was talking to a young student.  He was explaining something very big and important – the difference between Purusha and Prakriti.

Imagine a clear crystal, he said.  If a red flower is near, the crystal seems red, right?  That's like Purusha (the spirit) taking on qualities.  But the crystal itself isn't really red. It's just showing the flower's color. When the flower is gone, the crystal is clear again. That's Purusha without qualities.

Prakriti (nature) is different. It's always full of qualities, like colors and shapes.  It's like a playful child – always changing and doing things. It has no intelligence on its own, just like a toy without a person to play with it.  Purusha, on the other hand, is always wise and knowing.  It knows everything and is always aware of itself.

When Purusha and Prakriti are together, Prakriti becomes active and seems smart.  But if Purusha forgets its true nature and gets too attached to Prakriti’s qualities, it gets stuck. It can't find freedom.

Think of a fish in water, he said. The fish is separate from the water, even though it lives in it.  Or a worm in a fig – the worm is not part of the fig! It's the same with Purusha and Prakriti. They are together, but they are different.

If you think of them as one, you are mistaken. Yajnavalkya said it's like a reed and its outer cover, or fire in a pot.  They are together but not the same!

Understanding this difference between Purusha and Prakriti is very important.  If you understand, you can become free. That's what the wise people who studied the Sankhya philosophy wanted to know. They wanted to be free like the crystal when the flower is gone.  The teacher explained that this is like yoga – freeing your spirit to be its true self.
