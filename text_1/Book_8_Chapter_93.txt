King Dhritarashtra asked, "Sanjaya, what happened to my army that awful day?  Karna and Arjuna fought, and it was a terrible battle!"

Sanjaya replied, "King, it was a terrible battle!  Lots of people, elephants, and horses were hurt. When Arjuna killed Karna, the Kaurava soldiers were very scared.  They didn't want to fight anymore. They were like lost sailors on a big, stormy ocean – their ship had sunk, and they had no way to get home.

They ran away like scared elephants seeing lions! Some ran on horses, some on chariots, some on elephants, and some just ran on foot!  They bumped into each other, falling down in fear.  They were yelling, "Arjuna's chasing me!" and "Bhima's chasing me!"  It was a big mess.

Chariots crashed into elephants, horses fell down, and soldiers got trampled.  They were like sheep without a shepherd, lost in a scary forest full of wild animals.  They were all alone and afraid.

Duryodhana, the Kaurava king, saw his army running away. He told his driver to go slowly, behind everyone else. He said, "I'll fight at the back.  I'll defeat Arjuna and everyone else, and I’ll avenge Karna’s death!"

Then, 25,000 soldiers stayed behind to fight. But Bhima and Dhrishtadyumna, two strong Pandava warriors, attacked them. Bhima jumped off his chariot and fought them with his big club. He was like a strong hawk, and he killed all 25,000 soldiers!

Arjuna then fought the rest of the Kaurava chariots.  The other Pandava brothers also fought bravely.  When they saw Arjuna's chariot, with Krishna driving, the soldiers ran away again!  More soldiers died.

Then Duryodhana saw his army running. He tried to get them to fight again. He said, "Don't run!  The Pandavas are weak.  Let's fight and win, or die bravely! A warrior's duty is to fight!  Dying in battle is better than running away."

But even while Duryodhana spoke, his soldiers kept running away!"
