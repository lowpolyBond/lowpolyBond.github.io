Long ago, in the land of the Mahabharata, wise people gathered together.  They wanted to learn about being good and doing the right thing.  They asked Arundhati, a very holy woman, to tell them.

Arundhati said, "Being good comes from a good heart.  You can't teach someone who is mean, proud, or has done something really bad."  She explained that being kind to guests was very important.  It was even better than giving away lots and lots of cows!

Then Arundhati shared a secret.  "If you wake up early, take some water and grass, and sprinkle it on a cow's horns, then let the water drip on your head, it's like you've bathed in all the holy rivers in the world!" Everyone cheered!

Then, Yama, the god of death, spoke. He told everyone about Chitragupta, who keeps track of everyone's good and bad deeds. Yama said, "Every good deed you do is remembered.  Giving water, light, sandals, umbrellas, and especially cows, are very good things to do.  These things help you in the afterlife."

Yama explained that giving water helps you have water to drink in the next life.  Giving light means youâ€™ll never be in darkness. Giving a special cow to a wise person cleanses you of your sins!  He said that even giving sandals or an umbrella is good!

But Yama also said some things are really, really bad.  He said, "Never talk to people who kill wise people (Brahmins), kill cows, cheat on their wives, don't believe in good things, or sell their wives' honor. These people will suffer in the afterlife."

Everyone agreed that Arundhati and Yama had shared very important and helpful secrets about how to be good and kind.  They all praised the good things and learned to stay away from the bad.
