Once upon a time, during a great battle, a brave warrior named Satyaki fought for the Pandavas.  He was super strong and fast!  He zoomed around the battlefield, fighting lots of enemies all at once.  He was like a whirlwind!  It was amazing to watch. He fought so many soldiers from Trigarta, a faraway land, that they all ran away!

Then, other soldiers tried to stop him, but Satyaki was too powerful. He fought them, too, and then went to find his friend, Arjuna.  Arjuna was like a brother to him.

Krishna, Arjuna's best friend, saw Satyaki coming and told Arjuna, "Look! Satyaki's here! He's fought bravely, defeating many enemies. He's your friend, and he came to help you."

Arjuna wasn't happy though. He said, "I'm worried! Satyaki should have stayed with King Yudhishthira, to protect him.  Now the king might be in danger.  And Satyaki is tired, and he has to fight Bhurisravas next!  That's a tough fight. Did King Yudhishthira make a mistake by sending Satyaki to help me?"  Arjuna was nervous about what might happen. He was worried about his friend, Satyaki, and most of all about his brother, the king.  The sun was setting, and the battle wasn't over yet.
