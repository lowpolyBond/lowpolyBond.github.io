Once upon a time, during a HUGE battle in the Mahabharata, Arjuna, a great warrior, was fighting lots of enemies.  His bow, Gandiva, twanged loudly above all the noise.  He was battling the Samsaptakas, the Kosalas, and the Narayana army.

The Samsaptakas were angry and fired many arrows at Arjuna.  But Arjuna was super-fast! He dodged the arrows and fought back, killing many enemy warriors.  He even fought Susharma, a strong enemy warrior who also fired many arrows.  Susharma hit Arjuna a few times, and even hit Arjuna's chariot's flag!  The flag had a giant monkey on it, and it roared loudly, scaring everyone!  Arjuna's enemies were so scared they stopped fighting for a bit.

Then, they all attacked Arjuna again, raining arrows on his chariot.  They attacked his horses, wheels, and even tried to grab him!  But Arjuna was strong like an elephant, and he threw all his attackers off his chariot.  He fought bravely and killed many more enemies.

Arjuna told his friend Krishna, "Look at all these Samsaptakas!  They keep attacking, even though I'm killing thousands!" Then Arjuna blew his horn, and Krishna blew his too. The loud sound scared the Samsaptakas. Arjuna used a special magic to make their legs stiff, and they couldn't move!  They were stuck like statues!

Arjuna easily killed them all. But Susharma used his own magic to help his soldiers. Birds flew down and helped the Samsaptakas, and they started fighting again.  They shot many arrows at Arjuna and even hit him!  Arjuna was hurt, and everyone cried out, "Arjuna is dead!"

But Arjuna wasn't dead! He used another magic power that sent thousands of arrows flying, killing lots more enemies.  The Samsaptakas were so scared, no one wanted to fight Arjuna anymore. He was so strong, he killed over 20,000 soldiers, elephants, and horses!  The battle was fierce, and everyone was terrified of Arjuna's power.
