Rama's brother, Bharata, brought terrible news: their father, the king, was dead!  Rama was so sad he fainted. He fell to the ground like a tree chopped down.  Sita and Lakshmana poured water on him to wake him up.

When Rama finally woke, he cried.  "What will I do now?" he sobbed. "My father is gone! Who will rule the kingdom?  I wasn't even there to take care of him when he died!"  He praised Bharata for taking care of their father's funeral.

Rama looked at Sita, his wife, and said, "My father is gone. Lakshmana, you don't have a father anymore either.  Lakshmana, please get me some special fruit and new clothes. I need to offer water to honor my father."  

A kind old man named Sumantra helped them go to a special river, the Mandakini.  They poured water into the river, saying, "Father, this water is for you." Rama poured water and cried, "Father, this water is for you, always." They also made a special food offering for their father.

Rama, Sita, Lakshmana, and Bharata cried together. Their sad sounds echoed through the mountains.  The king's army heard them. They thought Rama had been gone a long time. They rushed to see him.  The animals in the forest were scared by all the noise!

When the army saw Rama, they were very sad too. They blamed Kaikeyi and Manthara for what happened.  Rama hugged everyone and comforted them. Everyone cried together. Their sadness filled the air!
