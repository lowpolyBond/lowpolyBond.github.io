Once upon a time, a great war was about to begin.  Just like the wise man Vyasa had said, all the kings came to fight!  The sky looked strange. The sun seemed to split in two!  The moon was close to the spirits of the dead. Scary jackals and crows cried out, waiting for the battle to end.

Every morning, the old king and his friend Drona wished for the Pandavas (the good guys) to win.  The brave Bhishma, the grandfather of the kings, told everyone, "Warriors, this battle is your chance to go to heaven!  Great kings before you died bravely in battle.  It's a warrior's duty!"

So, the kings got ready.  They all looked amazing in their chariots!  Only Karna, a great warrior, stayed behind for a while to honor Bhishma.  Then, the Pandavas and their army came, roaring like lions.  Their army was full of bright colors – white umbrellas, flags, elephants, horses, chariots, and soldiers!  It was noisy, with drums, cymbals and chariot wheels!

Bhishma, the leader of the Kauravas (the bad guys), had a big, beautiful flag.  He looked like the sun!  All the Kaurava warriors got into their places, just as Bhishma told them.  There was Saivya on his elephant, Aswatthaman with his lion-tail flag, and many more brave warriors.  Their flags were amazing – golden, sparkling things! Drona's flag had a golden altar, and Duryodhana's flag had a jeweled elephant.  Many more kings joined them – like the King of Magadha, with his bull flag.

Karna’s son and Kripa led the Eastern army, which looked like fluffy clouds. Jayadratha, with his boar flag, had a huge army –  lots of chariots, elephants and horses!  The Sindhu king and the Kalinga king, with Ketumat, also had powerful armies with giant elephants.  King Bhagadatta was like a storm, and Vinda and Anuvinda, two strong princes, were right behind him.

The Kaurava army was like a giant animal!  The elephants were its body, the kings were its head, and the horses were its wings.  It looked ready to pounce! The battle was about to begin!
