Once upon a time, there was a big party on a mountain!  The Vrishnis and Andhakas, two groups of brave warriors, were celebrating.  It was a super fun party with lots of music, dancing, and yummy food.  Everyone was dressed in their finest clothes.  Even the king, Ugrasena, was there with all his wives!

Arjuna, a very strong and handsome warrior, and his friend Krishna were at the party too.  They saw Krishna's beautiful sister, Subhadra.  Arjuna thought she was the most beautiful girl he'd ever seen! He was completely smitten.

Krishna saw how much Arjuna liked his sister. He smiled and asked Arjuna, "Arjuna, are you in love with my sister?  Her name is Subhadra.  If you want to marry her, I'll talk to our father."

Arjuna said, "Subhadra is so beautiful!  I would love to marry her! Tell me how I can!"

Krishna said, "Warriors like us sometimes take what they want!  Let's take Subhadra!"

Krishna and Arjuna decided to do something a little bit sneaky.  They sent a quick message to Arjuna's brother, Yudhishthira, to tell him their plan.  Yudhishthira agreed.  So, Arjuna planned to take Subhadra away.  This was how Arjuna met Subhadra and eventually married her.
