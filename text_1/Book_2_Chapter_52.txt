One sunny morning, Rama, a strong and brave prince, woke up.  "Lakshmana," he said, "the sun is coming up!  Listen to the birds singing in the forest. Let's cross the fast-flowing river!"

Lakshmana, Rama's brother, called Guha and Sumantra.  Guha, understanding Rama's plan, told his helpers, "Quickly! Bring a strong boat for Rama!"

Soon, a big, strong boat arrived. Guha bowed to Rama. "Your boat is ready, my prince!  Please, get on board."

Rama said, "Thank you, Guha. Let's put our things in the boat."  Rama and Lakshmana, with their bows and arrows, got on the boat.

Sumantra bowed low. "What are your orders, my prince?" Rama patted Sumantra's hand. "My good friend, go back to the king and help him. I'm going to the forest on foot, not in the chariot."

Sumantra was very sad. He cried, "Oh, Rama, everyone will miss you!  Going to the forest will be hard!  But you will be famous, like a king who rules the whole world! We will miss you!"

Sumantra cried for a long time. Then, Rama said kindly, "Sumantra, be a good friend to the king. He's old and sad. Do what Queen Kaikeyi wants.  Tell the king, 'Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita are fine in the forest.  We'll be back in fourteen years!'"

Rama also told Sumantra to tell his mother and the other queens that he was okay.  He asked Sumantra to make Bharata, his younger brother, the new king.  "Tell Bharata to be kind to our mothers," Rama said.

Sumantra begged Rama to let him come to the forest. "I can't leave you, Rama!  I'll even jump into a fire!" he cried.

Rama said, "I know you're a loyal friend. But I need you to go back and make my stepmother, Kaikeyi, happy. She'll be pleased to see that I've gone to the forest."

Rama then talked to Guha.  "I'll build a small house in the forest. I, Sita, and Lakshmana will live simply.  Guha, please bring me the milky sap from the Bhurja tree."

Guha brought the sap.  Rama poured it over his head and Lakshmanaâ€™s.  They looked like forest monks!

Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana said goodbye to Guha. They went to the river.  Lakshmana helped Sita into the boat, then he got in.  Rama got in last.

On the boat, Sita prayed to the river goddess Ganga, asking her to keep Rama safe.  She promised to give gifts to the gods when they returned.

They reached the other side.  Rama said, "Lakshmana, protect Sita.  I'll walk behind you both, to keep you safe."

Sumantra watched them go, heartbroken. Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita walked into the forest.  They ate berries and roots, and slept under the trees.
