Sanjaya said, "Karna finished talking.  Then Duryodhana, the Kaurava prince, spoke to Drona, their teacher, who was with the army.

Duryodhana said, 'Teacher Drona, you are the wisest and bravest of us all! You're strong, smart, and a great warrior.  You're better than any other leader. Please be our leader! You're like Indra, the king of the gods, protecting his army.  With you leading us, we'll win! You're the best teacher, the best warrior â€“ the best of everyone!  We have a huge army, ready to follow you. Lead us to victory!  Arjuna is afraid of you.  If you lead us, we'll beat the Pandavas easily!'

Sanjaya continued, 'All the Kaurava kings shouted, "Victory to Drona!" They were so happy!  The whole army cheered.  They all praised Drona, their amazing teacher.  Then, Drona spoke to Duryodhana.'"
