The battle was over.  The good guys won!  But Duryodhana, the mean king, was badly hurt.  Messengers told his friends – Ashvatthama, Kripa, and Kritavarma – what happened.

They rushed to the battlefield on their fast horses. There, they found Duryodhana lying on the ground.  He was covered in blood and looked very, very sad. He was hurt so badly he looked like a big tree that had fallen in a storm!  He was like a giant elephant a hunter had caught.  His friends were shocked.

Ashvatthama, Drona's son, cried.  He said, "King Duryodhana, the world is so unfair!  You, a great king, are lying here alone! Where are your friends? Where is your big army?"

Duryodhana, even though he was hurt, wiped his eyes and said,  "Everyone dies someday.  I fought bravely. I'm lucky my friends survived. Don't be sad for me."

Ashvatthama was still angry. His father had been killed unfairly.  He promised to get revenge!  He wanted to fight again!

Duryodhana told Kripa, another friend, "Get me some water."  Then he said, "Make Ashvatthama the leader of our army!" Even though Ashvatthama was a priest's son, he could fight like a warrior.

Ashvatthama hugged Duryodhana and roared like a lion.  Then,  Duryodhana's friends helped him leave the battlefield.  They were very sad, and they didn't know what to do next.  The end.
