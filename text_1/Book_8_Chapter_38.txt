Karna, a great warrior on the Kaurava side, roared into battle!  He wanted to find Arjuna, the greatest warrior on the Pandava side.  So, Karna shouted to all the Pandava soldiers, "Anyone who shows me Arjuna will get a HUGE reward!"

He offered amazing prizes! First, he promised mountains of gold and jewels.  If that wasn't enough, he'd give a whole cartload more!  Then, he promised hundreds of cows with shiny brass buckets, and even a hundred of the best villages!

He kept going! He promised beautiful girls with long, dark hair, and a fancy carriage pulled by white mules!  He offered another amazing golden carriage pulled by huge bulls, almost as big as elephants!  Then, he offered more beautiful girls who could sing and dance, plus hundreds of elephants, villages, and carriages!

He wasn't done yet!  He promised thousands of strong horses, and even cows with golden horns and their babies!  He promised more horses with beautiful gold decorations and jewels. He offered a stunning golden chariot pulled by the fastest horses.  He even promised hundreds of elephants wearing gold necklaces!

Karna was really, really trying to impress everyone!  He promised fourteen amazing villages, full of people and riches, and even more beautiful servant girls.  He said, "If you still want more, just ask! I'll give you anything â€“ even my sons and everything I own!"

He went on to say, "And if I defeat Arjuna, I will give you all his treasure, too!"

After making all these big promises, Karna blew a loud, beautiful horn.  His friends were very happy.  The Kaurava army cheered, banging drums, trumpets, and cymbals.  Elephants trumpeted, and everyone shouted with excitement!

But one warrior, from Madras, just laughed! He thought Karna was bragging too much. He couldn't believe all the promises Karna was making.  The battle was about to begin, and Karna's boasting had just started.
