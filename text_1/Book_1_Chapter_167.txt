After defeating the scary monster Vaka, the Pandava brothers stayed at the kind Brahmin's house.  They were busy studying.

Soon, another Brahmin came to visit. The first Brahmin welcomed him. He was very kind and shared his home.  The Pandavas and their mother, Kunti, asked the new Brahmin to tell them stories.

He told them amazing tales about faraway lands, rivers, kings, and cities!  Then he told them a really special story.  It was about a princess named Draupadi.  He explained how she was born from a magical fire at a big ceremony.  He also talked about her brothers, Dhrishtadyumna and Shikhandi, who were born in special ways too.

The Pandavas were very curious.  They asked the Brahmin, "How did Draupadi come from the fire?  How did her brother Dhrishtadyumna come from the fire?  How did Dhrishtadyumna learn to fight so well? And why did Drupada (their father) and Drona (their teacher) become enemies?"

The Brahmin happily answered all their questions, and told them the whole story of Draupadi's amazing birth!
