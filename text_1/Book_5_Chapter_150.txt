Once upon a time, in the land of Kuru, there was a big fight brewing.  King Dhritarashtra’s sons, the Kauravas, led by the mean Duryodhana, refused to share the kingdom with their cousins, the Pandavas.

Many wise people – Bhishma, Drona, Vidura, Gandhari, and even Dhritarashtra himself – tried to talk Duryodhana into sharing.  But Duryodhana was stubborn and angry!  He stomped out of the meeting, his face red with rage.  All the kings who were his friends followed him, ready to fight.

Duryodhana shouted, "Let's march to Kurukshetra today!  We have a huge army!"  He had gathered a massive army, led by the great warrior Bhishma.

King Vasudeva, the Pandavas' father, explained everything to his sons. He said, "I tried everything! I talked nicely, I tried to make them disagree with each other, I even offered them gifts.  I suggested that you live with your uncle Dhritarashtra and just ask for five small villages. But Duryodhana wouldn't listen! He’s too wicked.”

Vasudeva continued, “Now, there is only one way.  A great war is coming.  All the kings are already on their way to Kurukshetra.  They will not give you your share of the kingdom without a fight.  They are ready to die, and a terrible war will begin.”  The Pandavas knew that a big, scary battle was about to begin.
