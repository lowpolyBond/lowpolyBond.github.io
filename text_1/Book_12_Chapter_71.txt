King Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather Bhishma, "Grandpa, how can a king keep his people happy and always do what's right?"

Bhishma said, "Yudhishthira, I'll tell you the most important things.  There are so many, I couldn't tell you all of them!  Always treat wise priests with great respect.  When they visit, stand up, touch their feet, and give them gifts.  This will bring you good luck.

Be honest, kind, and brave.  Don't be greedy or angry.  A king who is greedy and angry loses everything.  Never choose greedy or silly people to help you rule. Choose wise and honest people.  Greedy people are mean to the people, making them unhappy.

A king should collect taxes fairly.  He should take a small part of what the farmers grow. He should also collect taxes from traders, but only what is fair.  Use the money wisely so people aren't poor.

People love a king who is kind, fair, and protects them.  A king shouldn't be greedy and try to get rich by being unfair.  It's like trying to get milk from a cow by hurting it â€“ you won't get any! A king who is kind to his people will get much more.  The land will give you lots of food and gold, just like a good mother gives milk to her baby. Be like a gardener who nurtures his plants, not like a charcoal maker who destroys the trees.

If you go to war and run out of money, you can take money from anyone except the priests.  Always be kind and generous to the priests, even if you are poor.  If you are kind to them, you'll have a wonderful life after you die.

Protect your people, and you'll be famous and happy.  Protecting your people is the most important thing a king can do. Being kind to everyone is the best thing you can do. If you don't protect your people even for one day, you'll suffer in hell for a thousand years! But if you do protect them, you'll live in heaven for ten thousand years!

Being a good king is better than anything else. You are a wise king, so rule fairly and kindly.  Give gifts to the gods and to your friends."
