Once upon a time, Sahadeva, one of the Pandava brothers, disguised himself as a cowherd. He wore simple clothes and spoke like a cowherd.  He went to King Virata's city and found work looking after the king's cows.

King Virata saw Sahadeva. He was amazed! Sahadeva looked like a very important person.  The king asked, "Who are you? Where do you come from? What kind of work do you want? I've never seen you before!"

Sahadeva answered in a strong voice, "I'm a cowherd named Arishtanemi. I used to work for the Pandavas, but I don't know where they are now. I need a job, and I would like to work for you, Your Majesty."

King Virata wasn't sure.  He said, "You don't look like a regular cowherd. You look like a king!  Tell me the truth. Where are you from? What do you know? What will you do for me?"

Sahadeva explained, "I used to take care of the Pandavas' many cows.  I knew everything about cows â€“  how many they had, what would happen to them in the future, and even how to help them have more baby cows! People called me Tantripala because I was so good at my job."

King Virata was impressed. He said, "I have many cows! I'll put you in charge of them all!"

So Sahadeva became the cowherd for King Virata.  He kept his true identity a secret, and no one knew he was one of the powerful Pandava brothers. He lived happily, working with the cows, until he could reunite with his brothers.
