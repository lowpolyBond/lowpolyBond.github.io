Once upon a time, after a big battle, Karna, a brave warrior, spoke to Duryodhana, a powerful king.  "Duryodhana," he said, "you've won!  Now you should rule the land like the greatest king of all!"

Duryodhana was very happy. He said to Karna, "I want to hold a special ceremony, like the one the Pandavas had. Can you help me?"

Karna said, "Of course! Since you control the whole land, let's gather the best priests. They'll plan a wonderful ceremony with lots of food and drink!"

Duryodhana called a priest.  "I want to have the Rajasuya sacrifice!" he said.

But the priest shook his head. "No, King," he said. "You can't have the Rajasuya while Yudhishthira is still alive.  And your father, Dhritarashtra, is still alive too.  But," the priest said, "there's another great ceremony, the Vaishnava sacrifice. It's almost as good as the Rajasuya!"

The priest explained, "You can use gold from the kings who now obey you to make a special plow.  Youâ€™ll plow the ground for the ceremony, and it will be a wonderful feast!"

Duryodhana loved this idea. He asked Karna and his friends, "What do you think?"  They all agreed it sounded great!

So Duryodhana chose people to do different jobs. He told the workers to build the special plow.  Everyone got to work, and soon, everything was ready for the amazing Vaishnava sacrifice!
