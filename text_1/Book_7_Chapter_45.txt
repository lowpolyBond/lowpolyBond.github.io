King Dhritarashtra asked, "My brave warriors fought Abhimanyu, the brave son of Subhadra.  He was so strong and he fought on his amazing three-year-old horses!  Who fought him?"

Sanjaya answered, "Abhimanyu was super strong! He drove away many kings with his sharp arrows.  Then, six great warriors surrounded him: Drona, Kripa, Karna, Aswatthaman (Drona's son), Vrihadvala, and Kritavarman.  Many other soldiers fought too, but they were busy fighting Yudhishthira because Jayadratha was holding him off.

These strong warriors rained arrows down on Abhimanyu like a storm! But Abhimanyu was even stronger. He shot back at them! He hit Drona with fifty arrows, Vrihadvala with twenty, Kritavarman with eighty, and Kripa with sixty! He even hit Aswatthaman with ten special golden arrows! He shot a powerful arrow and hit Karna too.  He shot so many arrows that he knocked Kripa's horses and driver off their chariot, and then hit Kripa himself! He even killed Vrindaraka, a famous Kurus warrior!

Then, Aswatthaman hit Abhimanyu with twenty-five arrows.  Abhimanyu shot many arrows back at him! Aswatthaman shot sixty more arrows at Abhimanyu, but Abhimanyu didn't move â€“ he was as strong as a mountain! Abhimanyu shot back even more arrows!  Drona and Aswatthaman shot many more arrows because they wanted to protect each other. Karna and Kritavarman and Vrihadvala and Kripa all shot lots of arrows at Abhimanyu, too. But Abhimanyu kept fighting! He shot ten arrows back at each of them!

Then a king from Kosala shot Abhimanyu in the chest. Abhimanyu was so strong, he knocked the king's horses, his chariot, his bow, and even his driver to the ground! The king was left with nothing, so he grabbed a sword. But before he could use it, Abhimanyu shot an arrow and killed the king Vrihadvala. When they saw this, ten thousand other soldiers were scared and ran away! Abhimanyu kept fighting bravely, shooting arrows at all the soldiers."
