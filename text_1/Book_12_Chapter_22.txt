Arjuna went to his older brother, King Yudhishthira.  Yudhishthira was very sad. Arjuna said, "Brother, you're a great king! You've fought bravely and won many battles. Why are you so upset?

For warriors like us, dying in battle is better than doing lots of religious ceremonies. That's what our rules say.  Warriors are meant to fight!  Our duty is to use weapons. We should die fighting if we have to.  Even if a priest acts like a warrior, it’s okay, because warriors and priests come from the same source.

Warriors don't just pray or give away their belongings. We fight! You’re a wise king.  You know what’s right and wrong. Stop being sad! Be strong!  A warrior's heart is strong like thunder!

Even Indra, the king of the gods, fought many battles. He fought his own family! He was a great warrior and became the leader of the gods because of it.

You should celebrate and give gifts to people, just like Indra. Don't worry about the past.  Those who died in battle are heroes.  It was meant to happen. You can’t change what fate has decided."
