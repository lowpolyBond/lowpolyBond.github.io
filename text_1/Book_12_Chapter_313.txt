A long, long time ago, a wise man named Yajnavalkya told a king a story about the beginning and end of the world.  He said that a powerful being, like a super-god, creates everything.  This god is always there, never beginning and never ending.

When this god wants to rest, it's like nighttime for the world. He sends another powerful being, Maharudra, to destroy everything.  Imagine Maharudra like a giant sun, blazing with light!  He's so strong, he wipes out all the animals, plants, and everything else in a flash!  The Earth becomes empty, like a bare turtle shell.

Then, Maharudra makes a big flood, covering the empty Earth with water.  Next, he uses a super-hot fire to dry up the water. After the fire is gone, a mighty wind blows everything away.  Then, empty space disappears.  Then, thought itself disappears.  And finally, even consciousness, which is what makes us *us*, is gone.

Everything gets swallowed up by a giant being, Sambhu.  Sambhu is everywhere, inside everything, and yet he's small enough to fit on your thumb!  After Sambhu swallows everything, only the unchanging, undying god remains.  That's how the world ends, said Yajnavalkya.  Then he told the king even more amazing stories!
