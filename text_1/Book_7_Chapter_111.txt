King Yudhishthira asked Satyaki, a very brave warrior, to go help Arjuna.  Satyaki was worried what people would think if he didn't go, so he agreed.

"I'll go help Arjuna," Satyaki said. "He's my best friend!  And I'll do anything for you, King Yudhishthira!"

Satyaki knew it was a dangerous journey.  He had to fight his way through a huge army! There were thousands of soldiers,  lots of elephants, and even scary warriors riding elephants!  He knew he'd face Karna and Kripa, too.  It was a long way, three whole yojanas (that's a very long distance!).

"But I'll get there!" Satyaki declared.  "I will fight through all of them to reach Arjuna, no matter what!"

King Yudhishthira gave Satyaki the best weapons and a strong chariot with fast horses. He even gave Satyaki a special blessing.  Satyaki felt powerful and ready to fight.

Before he left, Yudhishthira also asked Bhima, another strong warrior, to protect the king.  Satyaki told Bhima to stay and keep the king safe.

"Go protect the King, Bhima!" Satyaki said.  "I'll be okay.  I'm going to defeat the enemy!"

Bhima agreed and stayed behind to protect Yudhishthira. Then, Satyaki roared into battle, charging through the enemy army like a lion!  The enemy soldiers were so scared, they froze!
