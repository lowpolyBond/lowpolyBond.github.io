King Dhritarashtra asked, "Who started the big battle, my side or the Pandavas?"

Sanjaya answered, "Dussasana, Dhritarashtra's son, led the Kaurava army with Bhishma at the front. The Pandavas, with Bhima leading them, charged right back!  Boom!  It was loud!  There were shouts, elephant trumpets, drums, and cymbals â€“ a huge, noisy mess!  Both armies crashed together!

Bhima roared like a giant lion!  His roar was louder than the drums, trumpets, and even the elephants!  It was so loud, it scared the Kaurava soldiers!  Their horses and elephants even peed and pooped from fear!

Duryodhana, Duhsasana, and other Kaurava princes fought back. They shot many arrows at Bhima, covering him like a dark cloud.

The Pandavas fought bravely too!  Draupadi's five sons, Arjuna's son Abhimanyu, Nakula, Sahadeva, and Dhrishtadyumna attacked the Kauravas with sharp arrows.

Nobody ran away in that first big clash!  Drona's students were amazing archers; they never missed!  The sounds of the bows twanging were never-ending.  Arrows flew everywhere, like shooting stars!

Other kings watched the battle.  The Kaurava and Pandava armies looked beautiful from far away, like a painted picture.  Then, even more kings joined the fight.  The dust from the battle made it hard to see the sun!

The battle was huge and loud, like a stormy ocean! Thousands of soldiers fought on both sides.  It was so chaotic, you couldn't tell who was winning! But even in all the chaos, your father, Bhishma, was the bravest and strongest warrior of all!"
