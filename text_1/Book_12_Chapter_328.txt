Suka was a very wise young man.  After talking with King Janaka, he felt peaceful and happy.  He didn't need to ask any more questions.  Suka zipped north to the Himavat mountains, fast as the wind!

These mountains were amazing!  Beautiful fairies (Apsaras) lived there.  Lots of singing creatures like Kinnaras (half-human, half-horse) and other magical beings filled the air with music.  Peacocks showed off their bright feathers, and swans and happy birds sang pretty songs.  Even Garuda, the king of the birds, lived there!  Many good gods and wise people visited these special mountains.  

A long time ago, Vishnu, a powerful god, prayed there to have a son.  And a long time ago,  a brave young god named Kumara threw his magic spear into the ground!  He challenged anyone stronger or more devoted to the gods to pick it up.  Everyone was scared!

Even the gods were worried.  Vishnu, so strong he could lift the spear, only shook it a little. He wanted to show everyone how powerful Kumara was.  Prahlada, a very strong man, tried to lift it but couldn't! He fainted.

Farther up the mountain, another powerful god, Mahadeva, was praying.  His special place was surrounded by fire, so only good people could go near.  

At the bottom of the mountain, Suka's dad, Vyasa, taught the holy books (Vedas) to his students.  Suka, shining bright like the sun, hurried to see his father. He told Vyasa everything he learned from King Janaka.

One day, Vyasa’s four students asked for a special wish.  They wanted to be the only ones to teach the Vedas! They didn’t want anyone else to be famous for teaching them.  Vyasa, very wise, said that everyone who was good and wanted to learn should be taught the Vedas.

He told his students that they should only teach good people who really wanted to learn and follow the rules. They should teach fairly and wisely. They shouldn't teach anyone who didn't deserve it, just like you wouldn't give away your favorite toy to someone who might break it.  Vyasa explained that teaching the Vedas was a very important job, and it had to be done the right way. He wanted the good teachings to spread everywhere.
