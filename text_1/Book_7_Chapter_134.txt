King Dhritarashtra was sad.  He thought fate was in charge.  Even Karna, a very strong warrior, couldn't beat Arjuna's brother, Bhima.  Dhritarashtra's son, Duryodhana, always bragged about Karna. He said, "With Karna on my side, we could beat even the gods!"  But Duryodhana was wrong.

Bhima was incredibly strong!  He was like a giant!  Even many strong warriors together couldn't beat him.  When Karna was defeated, Duryodhana sent other soldiers to fight Bhima.  It was like sending tiny ants against a roaring lion!  They didn't stand a chance.

Dhritarashtra worried.  He said, "No one can survive facing Bhima's anger!  He's like death itself!"  He was very upset because Bhima had defeated his best warriors, including Karna.  His sons were scared of Bhima, and they wouldn’t fight him anymore.

Sanjaya, Dhritarashtra's advisor, said, “King, you started this war! Your sons' bad choices caused all this. It's too late to change things now.  Let me tell you what happened next.”

Five of Dhritarashtra's sons tried to stop Bhima.  They were brave warriors, but they were no match for him.  They attacked Bhima with many arrows, like a swarm of bees, but Bhima just smiled!  Then Karna tried to help, shooting many arrows.  But Bhima was too strong.  He quickly defeated all five of Dhritarashtra's sons, and even Karna looked scared.  Bhima was incredibly powerful, and even though Karna tried his best to fight back, he was no match for Bhima’s strength and fury.
