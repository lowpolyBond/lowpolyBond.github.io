The night passed. Krishna and his driver, Daruka, had a chat.  When the sun came up, King Yudhishthira woke up.  Lots of musicians played happy music.  They played drums and other instruments.  The music was so loud, it woke the king!

Yudhishthira got up and went to take a bath.  One hundred and eight servants helped him. They brought many golden jars of special scented water.  He washed with lovely smelling water and herbs. Then, he dried himself with a fluffy white cloth.  He put on nice sandalwood paste and flowers.

He prayed to the gods.  Then he went to see the priests.  Thousands of priests were there! They were very holy men.  Yudhishthira gave them gifts: gold, horses, and delicious food. He walked around them respectfully.

He saw more beautiful things: lucky symbols, flowers, and yummy treats. Servants brought a beautiful golden chair for him to sit on. He put on his sparkly jewels.  He looked very handsome! Servants fanned him with soft yak tails.  More musicians played, and people sang his praises.

Suddenly, there was a lot of noise!  Carriages, horses, and elephants were arriving. The ground shook a little!  A guard came and said that Krishna was waiting to see him.  Yudhishthira ordered a special seat and welcome drink for Krishna.  He welcomed his friend with a big smile and lots of respect.
