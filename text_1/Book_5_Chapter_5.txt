Krishna, a very clever friend, spoke to King Virata.  He said, "These kingdoms are perfect for the strong Pandava brothers.  We should be smart and try to make peace first.  It's the best way. We are friends with both the Kauravas and the Pandavas.  We came for a wedding, and now the wedding is over, let's go home.  You, King Virata, are the wisest king. We all look up to you. Dhritarashtra, the Kaurava king, respects you a lot. Youâ€™re also friends with their teachers. Please, send a message to the Kauravas, asking them to make peace with the Pandavas. If they agree to be fair, everyone will be happy. But if the Kaurava prince, Duryodhana, is stubborn and refuses, then call us back.  We will help the Pandavas fight!"

King Virata thanked Krishna and sent him home.  Then, Yudhishthira and his brothers, with King Virata, started getting ready for war.  They sent messages to all their friends, asking for help.  King Drupada also sent messages. Many strong kings came to help the Pandavas.  When the Kauravas heard about the big army, they also gathered many soldiers.  The whole land filled with soldiers!  There were so many soldiers marching that the earth seemed to shake!  King Drupada even sent a wise priest to talk to the Kauravas.
