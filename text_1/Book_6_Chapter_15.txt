Once upon a time, there was a big war between two families: the Pandavas and the Kauravas.  A wise man named Sanjaya told King Dhritarashtra all about it.

The King asked why the war happened. Sanjaya said, "It wasn't just Duryodhana's fault.  Duryodhana did many bad things, and bad things always have bad consequences.  People who hurt others deserve to be stopped."  The Pandavas had been very patient, even though the Kauravas were mean to them. They forgave them many times.

Sanjaya had special powers. He could see everything happening far away, even the past and the future! He told the King, "This war was meant to happen.  Don't be sad."

Then, Sanjaya described the battle. Duryodhana, the Kaurava leader, told his brother Dussasana, "We need to protect our strongest warrior, Bhishma!  He's the key to winning."  Bhishma wouldn't fight Sikhandin, a warrior from the Pandava side, because Sikhandin used to be a woman. Duryodhana wanted to make sure Bhishma stayed safe, so he ordered his army to protect him from Sikhandin.  He said, "Even a strong lion can be killed by a wolf if it's not protected! We can't let Sikhandin defeat Bhishma!"  The Pandavas had also arranged their own protection for Sikhandin.  They wanted to make sure their warrior was safe too.

The battle was about to begin.  It was going to be a very scary fight!
