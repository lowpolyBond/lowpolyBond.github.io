Once upon a time, during a big war, Duryodhana was very angry. He went to his teacher, Drona, and complained.  "Teacher," he whined, "we let the Pandavas rest. Now they're strong again, and we're tired! You're the best warrior ever! You have magical weapons!  Nobody can beat you! Why are you letting the Pandavas win?"

Drona, a wise old man, sighed.  "Duryodhana, I'm fighting hard!  But if I kill them all, it wouldn't be right.  However, I'll do what you want." Drona then boasted about Arjuna, the Pandava warrior.  "Arjuna is incredibly strong! He's defeated gods and monsters! Even the powerful Indra couldn't beat him!"

Duryodhana was still furious. "I, Duhsasana, Karna, and my uncle Sakuni, we'll kill Arjuna!" he declared.

Drona chuckled. "You? Kill Arjuna? That's like a little ant trying to defeat a giant elephant!  Arjuna is unbeatable! But," Drona continued, "Youâ€™re a brave warrior.  You want to fight Arjuna, go ahead. You've lived a good life, and death in battle would be honorable.  Your uncle Sakuni is clever, and Karna is strong.  Go fight! Prove you're a true warrior."

And so, after Drona spoke these words, the mighty battle began!
