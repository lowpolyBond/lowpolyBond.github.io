Once upon a time, during a great battle, a brave warrior named Satyaki fought the powerful Drona.  Drona showered Satyaki with arrows, like a rain of sharp sticks!  Their fight was fierce and amazing, like a battle between two legendary heroes from long ago.

Drona hit Satyaki three times on the forehead with special iron arrows.  Satyaki looked like a mountain with three peaks!  But Satyaki was quick and clever. He shot back many arrows at Drona, making a loud noise like thunder.

Drona smiled. He was strong and shot many more arrows at Satyaki – thirty, then fifty, then even a hundred!  But Satyaki fought back, shooting hundreds and thousands of arrows at Drona's chariot.  They were both so skilled, it was hard to say who was better!

Satyaki, very angry now, hit Drona with nine arrows.  He even hit Drona's flag and his driver with many more!  Drona, not to be outdone, hit Satyaki's driver and horses with arrows.  He even cut off Satyaki's bow with one arrow!

Satyaki grabbed a big club and threw it at Drona. Drona blocked it with more arrows. Then Satyaki grabbed a new bow and shot many arrows at Drona. Satyaki roared like a lion!  Drona, though very powerful, couldn't ignore that roar.

Drona threw a special dart at Satyaki’s chariot. The dart zoomed past Satyaki but crashed into the ground.  Satyaki hit Drona back on his arm with many arrows, hurting him badly.  Drona broke Satyaki's bow and hit Satyaki's driver, who fainted.

Satyaki became his own driver and kept fighting! He shot a hundred arrows at Drona. Drona shot back, and Satyaki's armor was pierced.  Angry, Satyaki shot many arrows back at Drona, even knocking Drona's driver off his chariot!  Drona’s chariot spun around and around.

Drona's friends saw what was happening.  They rushed to help, leaving Satyaki alone.  Because of Satyaki’s amazing skill, the other warriors were scared and disheartened.

Drona, with his horses tired, had to go back to protect his army. The battle was far from over, but for a moment, Satyaki had made a huge difference.  Drona, like a burning fire, protected his soldiers, ready for the next challenge.
