Sanjaya told the king, "Your son saw his army losing badly.  Many soldiers were hurt!  Angry, he ran to Karna and Drona, two great warriors.  He shouted, 'You started this fight because Savyasachi killed the Sindhu king! You're watching my army get beaten, even though you could easily win! If you leave me now, why didn't you say so before? You promised to defeat the Pandavas! I believed you and fought. If you hadn’t promised, I never would have fought the Pandavas!'”

The king’s son was very upset.  Karna and Drona felt bad, so they fought hard again. They charged towards the Pandavas, like angry snakes.  The Pandavas fought back.  Drona, a super-strong warrior, shot ten arrows at Satyaki. Karna, Vrishasena, and Suvala's son shot many arrows too. They surrounded Satyaki.

Then, the Somakas fought back and shot lots of arrows at Drona.  Drona was so strong, he fought like the sun destroying the darkness!  Many Panchala soldiers were scared. Some left their family to save their own lives. Others fought even though they were losing.  Many died.

That night, the Pandava army ran away. They dropped their torches, and it was very dark.  Only the Kaurava side had lights, so they could see the Pandavas running. Karna and Drona chased them.

Krishna felt sad. He told Arjuna, "Dhrishtadyumna and Satyaki fought Karna and Drona, but our army is broken. They’re running away, but don’t worry! We'll fight them together!"

Krishna saw Bhima coming to help.  He told Arjuna, "Bhima is here with the Somakas and Pandavas!  Fight with him, and we'll stop Drona and Karna!"

Arjuna and Krishna fought bravely alongside Bhima.

Sanjaya said, “Yudhishthira’s army returned to the battle. Drona and Karna were still fighting hard. That night, a big battle happened. It was so dark and dusty!  Soldiers could only tell who they were fighting by their voices.  It was very quiet for a moment, then the fighting started again. The warriors ran towards the lights like bugs to a flame.  Pandavas and Kauravas fought in the dark.”
