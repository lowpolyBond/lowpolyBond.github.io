Once upon a time, King Yudhishthira asked his grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandpa, how can we know if someone will be lucky or unlucky?"

Bhishma smiled. "Yudhishthira, a person's own mind shows signs of their future.  Let me tell you a story about Lakshmi, the goddess of good fortune."

Long ago, a very holy man named Narada was bathing in the river Ganga.  Suddenly, Indra, the king of the gods, arrived!  They talked for a while.

Then, something amazing happened!  A bright light appeared in the sky.  It was Lakshmi, the goddess of fortune, arriving in a beautiful chariot!  Indra, very respectful, greeted her.

"Who are you, beautiful goddess?" Indra asked.

Lakshmi answered, "I am Lakshmi, also called Padma and Sree. I bring good luck to everyone! I live with good people: those who are kind, honest, and brave. I live with those who are always fair and follow the right path."

Indra asked, "Why did you leave the Asuras (demons)?"

Lakshmi explained, "At first, the Asuras were good. They were kind to everyone, shared their food, and respected their elders. But things changed. They became mean, selfish, and disrespectful.  They didn't share, they fought, and they didn't treat others fairly."  She listed all the bad things they did.  "Because of this, I left them and came to you, Indra."

Indra welcomed Lakshmi. The gods were very happy.  The sky shone brightly, flowers bloomed, and everyone was lucky.

Bhishma finished the story, "Yudhishthira, this shows that good deeds bring good luck, and bad deeds bring bad luck.  Always try to be good and kind, just like the early Asuras, and good fortune will follow you!"
