Dhaumya, a wise man, told Yudhishthira, the king, about amazing holy places in the north.  "Listen closely, brave king!" he said. "These places are very special."

He talked about the Saraswati River. It was a beautiful river with easy banks, perfect for a bath.  There was also the fast-flowing Yamuna River.  Near them was a very special place called Plakshavatarana. People who went there felt happy and lucky.  People even did special ceremonies there!

Dhaumya told Yudhishthira about another holy place called Agnisiras.  King Sahadeva, Yudhishthira's brother, had done a special prayer there. Even the great god Indra praised Sahadeva for it!  Another king, Bharata, did many, many horse sacrifices there!

There was a place where a good king named Sarabhanga helped everyone.  And the Saraswati River, loved by the gods, where the Valikhilyas did their prayers.  He mentioned more holy rivers: Drisadwati, Nyagrodhakhya, Panchalya, Punyaka, Dalbhyaghosha, and Dalbhya.  These were amazing places where great people had done good things.  Kings Etavarna and Avavarana had done special ceremonies there, too!

There was Visakhayupa, where even the gods like Indra and Varuna went to pray.  And Palasaka, where the great wise man Jamadagni prayed.  All the rivers came together there, surrounding him!  Even the god of fire sang a song about it!

Dhaumya then told Yudhishthira about Gangadwara, where the mighty Ganges River flows down from the mountains. Many magical creatures lived there!  Sanatkumara, a wise being, said it was a very holy place.  Near it was another holy place called Kanakhala.

He also talked about Mount Puru.  This mountain was where the great Rishi Bhrigu prayed, and where Pururavas was born.  Nearby was Vadari, a very, very holy place. It was where Lord Vishnu, the most powerful god, lives!  The Ganges River flowed warmly here, with golden sands.  Gods and wise people always came here to worship Narayana.  He's the greatest of all, the source of all goodness and holiness.  Knowing him brings happiness.

Dhaumya said, "All these holy places are visited by the gods and wise people.  If you and your brothers go there with the Brahmins and wise men, you will be happy and peaceful."
