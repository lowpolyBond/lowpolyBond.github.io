Once upon a time, long, long ago, there was a powerful king named Sagara.  He was very strong and handsome.  He wanted a son very badly.  So, he went to a mountain to pray to a great god.

He prayed and prayed, and the god appeared!  The god was happy with the king's hard work and said, “You will have sixty thousand sons!”  But he also said,  “They will all die together.”  The god added that the king’s other wife would have one special son.

The king’s first wife gave birth to something that looked like a giant gourd. The king was about to throw it away, but a voice from the sky told him to carefully open the gourd. Inside were tiny seeds!  He planted the seeds, and guess what? Sixty thousand strong sons grew from them!

Later, the god Brahma said to all the other gods, "The ocean needs help. The ocean will fill again thanks to Bhagiratha, a descendent of King Sagara."  The gods went away and waited.


Yudhishthira, a king himself, wanted to know more about this story. He asked a wise holy man to tell him how the ocean was refilled.  The holy man agreed and told him the whole story of Sagara's sixty thousand sons, and what happened next.  That’s a story for another time!
