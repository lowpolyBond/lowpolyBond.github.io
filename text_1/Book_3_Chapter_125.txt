Long ago, a powerful god named Indra faced a scary monster named Mada. Mada had a huge mouth and looked like death itself!  Indra was so scared, his arms froze, and he nervously licked his lips.

Indra cried out to a wise man named Chyavana, "Help me!  This monster is going to eat me!"

Chyavana helped Indra, and as a reward, Indra said, "From now on, the Aswin twins, two special gods, can always drink the magical Soma juice!"

Chyavana agreed, and he made sure the monster Mada couldn't hurt anyone anymore.  He broke Mada into tiny pieces and hid them in things people liked:  drinks, women, games, and sports. So now, Mada was like a little bit of fun, not a scary monster anymore.

Chyavana then lived happily with his wife, Sukanya, near a beautiful lake.  He helped many people.

Later, a great king named Yudhishthira went to visit that very same lake. Chyavana told Yudhishthira, "This lake is very special!  Many gods and great people have been here.  Itâ€™s a place where you can wash away all your bad deeds and become a good person. You should offer water to honor your ancestors and the gods."

Chyavana showed Yudhishthira many special places: a hill with fruits that never ran out, springs with pure water, and even the spot where the gods used to live!  He told Yudhishthira, "This is a magical place! It's where the world changed from one time to another, and it can help you be a better person!"  He invited Yudhishthira and his brothers to visit these special places and pray to the gods.
