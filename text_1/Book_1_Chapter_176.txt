Once upon a time, a great warrior named Arjuna was hunting in the forest.  He was very strong and brave, like a mighty bull! He hunted deer and wild boars.  He got very thirsty and tired.

Arjuna came to a wise man's home, a holy Rishi named Vasishtha.  Vasishtha was kind. He welcomed Arjuna and gave him cool water, tasty fruits, and delicious food.  He had a magical cow named Nandini!

Nandini could give anything you asked for!  She gave milk, fruits, and even jewels!  Arjuna was amazed.

King Viswamitra, a powerful warrior, also saw Nandini. He really wanted the cow! He offered Vasishtha ten thousand cows, or even his whole kingdom, for Nandini.

But Vasishtha said, "Nandini is special. She's for the gods, my guests, and my ceremonies. I can't give her away."

Viswamitra was angry. He said, "I'm a king! I'll take the cow by force!"

Vasishtha just said, "If you must, go ahead."

Viswamitra tried to take Nandini. He hurt her and chased her. Poor Nandini cried.

She ran to Vasishtha and said, "Why don't you help me?"

Vasishtha, a very peaceful man, replied, "Kings are strong, but my strength is forgiveness. If you want to go, Nandini, you may go."

Nandini said, "If you don't stop me, I can't be taken!"

Vasishtha said, "I won't stop you. But your baby calf is tied up over there."

As soon as Vasishtha said this, Nandini became super strong!  She was angry!  From her tail, she made a rain of fire!  From her body, she created HUGE armies of soldiers!  These armies fought Viswamitraâ€™s soldiers.

Viswamitra's army ran away, scared! They ran for miles and miles!

Viswamitra was amazed. He saw that the wise man's power was much greater than his own. He realized that peace and kindness are stronger than fighting.

He gave up being a king and became a holy man, just like Vasishtha. He learned that true strength comes from peace, not war.
