King Dhritarashtra asked his advisor, Sanjaya, "Sanjaya, when the sun came up, which army—ours led by Bhishma, or the Pandavas' led by Bhima—looked more ready for a fight?  Which army did the sun, moon, and wind seem to be against? Which army did the animals sound warnings about?  And which soldiers looked the happiest?"

Sanjaya answered, "King, both armies looked amazing!  They were huge and strong, like two giant forests filled with elephants, chariots, and horses.  Neither army wanted to back down. They both seemed ready to fight even the gods! The Kauravas (your army) were facing west, and the Pandavas were facing east.  The Kauravas looked like an army of giants, while the Pandavas looked like an army of gods!

The wind blew towards the Kauravas. The wild animals cried out warnings against the Kauravas. Even your elephants didn’t like the smell of the Pandavas' elephants!

Duryodhana, your son, was in the middle of your army on a beautiful lotus-colored elephant.  He had a big golden umbrella over his head.  Sakuni, the king of Gandhara, was right behind him.  Bhishma, the great warrior, led your army. He was all in white—white clothes, white horse, white umbrella! It was like a white mountain moving!

Bhishma's army had many brave soldiers from many different lands.  Drona, a great teacher and warrior, was in a golden chariot with red horses. He was like a protector, watching over everyone.  Another brave warrior, Saradwat’s son, led the soldiers from the north.  Kritavarman led soldiers from the south.  Many, many soldiers were there! Your army had a thousand elephants, each with lots and lots of soldiers to help it!

Your army, King, was enormous and scary. But even though the Pandavas’ army was smaller, it felt even stronger because Arjuna and Krishna were leading them!"
