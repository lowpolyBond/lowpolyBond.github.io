King Yudhishthira was a very good king. He asked a wise man named Markandeya a lot of questions about fire.  He wanted to know why the fire god, Agni, hid in the water a long time ago.

Markandeya told him a story.  A long time ago, there was another powerful fire god named Angiras. Angiras was so bright and strong, he even shone brighter than Agni! Agni felt sad and worried. He thought, "Maybe I'm not the fire god anymore!"

Agni felt so bad, he hid himself in the ocean to think.  He was very upset. Angiras, who was very kind, saw Agni was unhappy.  He told Agni, "You are still the important fire god!  You're the one who keeps the world bright. I'll be a different kind of fire."

Agni was happy to be the main fire god again. Angiras then had a son named Vrihaspati. This son was special because Agni helped create him! The other gods were curious about this, so Angiras explained everything.

That's the story of how Agni, the fire god, and Angiras, another powerful fire, worked together! And that's why there are many kinds of fire, even though there is only one true source of fire. King Yudhishthira learned a lot that day!
