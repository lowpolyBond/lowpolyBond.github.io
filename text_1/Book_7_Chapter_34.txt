Once upon a time, during a big war, a brave young warrior named Abhimanyu was ready to fight.  His uncle, Yudhishthira, told him to go fight the enemy army led by the powerful Drona.

Abhimanyu's charioteer was worried.  He said, "Abhimanyu, Drona is a very strong warrior! You've lived a comfortable life.  This is a huge battle, are you sure you can handle it?"

But Abhimanyu laughed.  "Who's Drona?" he asked. "Even if I fought a whole army of gods, I wouldn't be scared! This army is nothing to me! I'm not worried at all!"

So, Abhimanyu told his charioteer to rush into battle.  The charioteer wasn't happy, but he did as he was told.  Abhimanyu, on his fast horses, charged straight at Drona's army!

The enemy soldiers, led by Drona, were surprised! They all attacked Abhimanyu, but he was incredibly brave.  He fought like a lion against many elephants!  He was strong and skillful, and he quickly defeated many warriors.

The battlefield was filled with noise! Elephants trumpeted, horses neighed, and soldiers shouted. Abhimanyu fought so bravely that he broke through the enemy lines!  He was like a whirlwind, cutting down soldiers and their warhorses.  He cut down so many that the ground was covered in weapons and the bodies of fallen warriors.

He even destroyed many war chariots!  It was a very scary, but amazing battle. Abhimanyu fought so well that the enemy soldiers were terrified. They were so scared they ran away, leaving their wounded friends behind. Abhimanyu, all alone, had won a huge victory!
