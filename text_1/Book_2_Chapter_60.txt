Queen Kaushalya was very sad.  She was so upset she looked like she was going to faint!  She told her driver, Sumantra, "Please, take me to Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita! I can't live without them!"

Sumantra was sad too. He tried to comfort the Queen. "Don't worry," he said. "Rama is happy in the forest. Lakshmana is with him, and Sita is doing fine.  She's brave. She loves Rama so much that she thinks the forest is even better than a palace! She explores, learns about the plants and animals, and is happy just being with Rama."  He almost mentioned why Rama went to the forest, but quickly stopped himself.  He didn't want to upset the Queen even more.

Sumantra continued, "Sita looks beautiful!  The forest hasn't changed her. She still wears her pretty jewelry, and she even makes the swans jealous with her happy dancing! She isn't scared of lions or tigers because she knows Rama will protect her.  Everything will be alright.  Rama is doing what his father asked, and heâ€™ll be a hero for always obeying."

Even though Sumantra tried his best, Queen Kaushalya kept crying. "My dear Rama! My son!" she sobbed.  She missed him terribly.
