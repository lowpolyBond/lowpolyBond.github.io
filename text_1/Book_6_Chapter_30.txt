Once upon a time, Krishna, a wise and kind prince, taught his friend Arjuna about devotion.  He said, "Being devoted isn't about giving up everything. It's about doing what you should do, without worrying about the results."

Krishna explained that devotion is like a journey.  First, you act, helping others and doing good deeds. Then, as you grow, you become less attached to things and what people think.  You become happy from within, not from outside things like toys or treats.

He said, "Be your own best friend! Don't be your own worst enemy. Treat everyone the same â€“ your friends, your family, even people you don't like.  Be calm, even when things are hot or cold, happy or sad."

To become devoted, Krishna said to find a quiet place. Sit comfortably, close your eyes, and focus on your breathing. Think only good thoughts. Think of Krishna, or whoever makes you feel peaceful.

Krishna said, "It's not about eating a lot or eating nothing, sleeping too much or not sleeping enough. It's about being balanced. Do good deeds without being attached to them. Live simply."

He compared a devoted person to a lamp that doesn't flicker in the wind.  Their minds are calm and peaceful.  They are happy inside, no matter what happens.

Arjuna was worried. He said, "My mind is like the wind!  It's restless and hard to control!"

Krishna said, "It's hard, but not impossible. With practice and letting go of wanting things, you can calm your mind.  Even if you stumble, don't give up! Keep trying."

Krishna reassured Arjuna. Even if someone falls away from devotion, they'll have good things in their next life. They'll keep getting closer to being devoted, one step at a time.  "Devotion is the best path," Krishna said. "Those who are truly devoted, with faith in me, are closest to me."
