Once upon a time, there was a very tall and proud Salmali tree.  It was so big and strong!  But it was also very mean.  It decided to cut off all its own branches, leaves, and flowers.  It did this so it wouldn't look so big and strong anymore.

Then, the Wind came along.  The Wind was very angry! It usually loved to blow through the Salmali's branches, but now the tree was bare.  The Wind blew hard, knocking down other trees.  When the Wind saw the Salmali, it laughed.

"Silly tree," the Wind said, "I was going to do that to you! Now you're small and weak, just like you wanted. You did this to yourself!"

The Salmali was very ashamed.  It remembered some wise advice it had been given and felt very sorry for being so foolish.

Bhishma, a wise old man, told a king this story. He said it showed how a weaker person should never make a stronger person angry.  It's better to be kind and not fight someone much stronger than you.  Bhishma told the king that even though he had many soldiers, they weren't as strong as Arjuna, a single powerful warrior.  Arjuna won the battle because he was strong and brave.  

Bhishma said being smart and strong is important, but being kind is best. It's like being kind to a baby or someone who can't see or hear. Always remember this, he said. That's the important lesson from the Salmali tree.
