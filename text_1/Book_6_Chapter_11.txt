King Dhritarashtra asked his friend Sanjaya, "Sanjaya, you told me about Jambu Island.  Tell me more! How big is it? And tell me about the other islands and the sun, moon, and Rahu (a planet)."

Sanjaya said, "King, there are many islands! I'll tell you about seven, and the sun, moon, and Rahu.  Jambu Mountain is HUGE – 18,600 yojanas long!  (A yojana is a long distance!) The ocean around it is twice as big! It’s full of shiny gems and corals, and more mountains!  Lots of special beings live there.  It’s a round ocean."

"Now, let me tell you about Saka Island," Sanjaya continued.  "It's twice as big as Jambu Island! And the ocean around *it* is twice as big again!  People there are always good and kind. They never get sick or die! They never go hungry!  They’re always happy and strong. That’s all for now, King.  What else do you want to know?"

Dhritarashtra said, "Sanjaya, you only told me a little about Saka Island. Tell me everything!"

Sanjaya said, "Okay! Saka Island has seven amazing jewel-covered mountains! And many rivers! The first mountain is Mount Meru, where the gods live!  Next is Malaya Mountain, where the clouds are born. Then comes Jaladhara Mountain; Indra, the rain god, gets his rain water from there!  After that is Raivataka Mountain, with a special star above it.  Then there’s Syama Mountain, which is dark-colored, so the people who live there have dark skin."

Dhritarashtra asked, "Why do the people there have dark skin, Sanjaya?"

Sanjaya answered, "King, on every island there are people with light and dark skin.  Because Syama Mountain is dark, the people there are dark too. After Syama is Durgasaila Mountain, then Kesari Mountain, which smells wonderful!  Each mountain is twice as big as the one before it.  Saka Island has seven different areas called Varshas. Each one is named after a mountain. In the middle of Saka Island is a giant Saka tree, as big as the Jambu tree on Jambu Island! People there love that tree.  Everyone is good, and they all do their jobs. There’s no stealing! They live a very long time!  Many rivers flow there, like Ganga, which is divided into many smaller rivers.  It's impossible to name them all!  There are four special areas: the Mrigas, Masakas, Manasas, and Mandagas.  Each group has people who do different kinds of jobs. There’s no king, no rules, no punishments! Everyone is happy and helps each other. That’s Saka Island for you, King!"
