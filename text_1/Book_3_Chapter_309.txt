The Pandavas were very sad.  Their friend Krishna had been taken away. After they rescued her, they moved to a new forest called Dwaitavana.  It was a beautiful place with lots of yummy fruits and roots.

The Pandavas lived simply, eating fruits and being very good.  One day, a Brahmin (a holy man) came to them, very upset. A fast deer had run off with his special fire-making sticks and a churning stick! He needed them for his prayers.

Yudhishthira, the oldest Pandava brother, said, "Don't worry!"  He and his brothers – Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva – went to find the deer. They chased it, shooting arrows and spears. But the deer was super fast! It disappeared!

The Pandavas were tired, hungry, and thirsty. They sat under a big tree to rest. Nakula was sad.  He said, "We're always good and helpful. Why couldn't we catch that deer?"

This was just the beginning of a big adventure for the Pandavas!  They learned a very important lesson that day in the forest.
