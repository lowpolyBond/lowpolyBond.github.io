Once upon a time, in a great battle, Arjuna, a super strong warrior, was winning! He fought through many soldiers, even defeating strong princes like Sudakshina and Srutayudha.  Arjuna was like a wildfire, burning through Duryodhana’s army.

Duryodhana, scared and worried, rushed to his teacher, Drona.  "Teacher!" he cried, "Arjuna is unstoppable! He’s destroying everything! Please, help me save Jayadratha!"

Drona was a wise teacher, but he also had a vow he couldn't break.  He told Duryodhana, "Arjuna is too fast for me to catch!  You need to fight him yourself. You are strong and brave.  You are a king!"

Duryodhana was scared. "But teacher, Arjuna defeated even YOU! How can I fight him?"  He pleaded with Drona to help.

Drona thought for a moment.  He knew of a special magical armor.  "This armor," he said, "is so strong that no weapon can hurt you!  It was even worn by the gods!"

Drona chanted magic words and quickly put the special armor on Duryodhana.  He gave Duryodhana blessings from all the gods and great heroes of the past!  Everyone watched in amazement.

Drona explained how the armor had been passed down through generations, even used by the god Indra to defeat a mighty demon.  It was super strong and magically protected the wearer.

Duryodhana, feeling brave in his new armor, charged towards Arjuna, ready for a fight!  His army cheered loudly, happy to see their king fight back! The battle continued with a huge roar.
