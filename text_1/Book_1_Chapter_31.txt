Long ago, the great god Indra had a job to do.  King Kasyapa was having a big party, a sacrifice to have children! Indra was in charge of bringing the firewood.  He was super strong and carried a huge pile, like a mountain!

On his way, Indra saw some tiny, tiny people. They were so small, like your thumb!  They were super skinny because they hadn't eaten.  They were struggling in a puddle.  Indra, feeling very proud of his strength, laughed at them and just walked right over them!

These tiny people were actually very powerful magicians! They were very upset that Indra was mean to them.  They performed a special magic, a powerful prayer.  They wished for a new powerful being, someone even stronger than Indra, who could fly anywhere and be super strong!

Indra got scared! He went to Kasyapa for help.  Kasyapa, being kind, talked to the tiny magicians. He explained that Indra was already chosen to be the king of the gods. He asked the magicians to change their wish. Instead of creating a new king, they could make a powerful bird king!

The tiny magicians agreed. Meanwhile, Vinata, Kasyapa's wife, wanted children.  She prayed very hard.  Then, Kasyapa told her she would have two amazing sons who would be kings of all the birds!  These sons would be super strong and could change their shape.  They would help Indra.

Vinata had two sons: Aruna and Garuda. Aruna helped the sun, but Garuda became the king of all the birds! He was incredibly strong and could fly anywhere. He was unbeatable! And Indra learned a very important lesson about being kind to everyone, even the tiniest among us.
