The sun god, Surya, told a story.  "I saw something amazing!  This person isn't a fire god, a demon, or a snake-person. He's a wise Brahmin. He went to heaven because he was really, really good.

He ate only fruits, roots, and fallen leaves. Sometimes he only drank water, or even just breathed air!  He spent his time thinking good thoughts and praying to Lord Shiva. He was always kind.

He did all this because he wanted to go to heaven. And guess what? He did! He was so good, and so selfless, that he went to live in the sun!  Even gods and demons arenâ€™t as great as someone who lives such a good life.

This Brahmin was so good, and he lived in the sun because of how well he lived his life. To this day, he travels around the earth, right here in the sun!"
