King Yudhishthira asked his wise uncle Bhishma, "Uncle, you've told me about the jobs and lives of everyone â€“ the priests, the warriors, the farmers, and the workers. You've explained how kings should rule, how they get their money, and how they win battles.  You've told me about good advisors, happy people, and strong armies.  But what about the brave people who help the king? How can they all work together? How can they defeat enemies and make friends?  It seems like disagreements can ruin everything! How can they keep secrets when there are so many people?  Please tell me, Uncle!"


Bhishma said, "Yudhishthira, the biggest problems between the king and his noble helpers are greed and anger.  If the king is greedy, the nobles get angry.  Then they try to hurt each other, and everyone loses! They use spies, tricks, and even fighting to hurt each other.  If the king is too greedy, the nobles feel unhappy and might even help the king's enemies!  If the nobles don't work together, they are easy for enemies to defeat.

The nobles must be a team!  When they work together, they're strong!  Others want to be their friends. Smart people admire them. If they all agree on what's right, they'll be happy and successful. They should teach their children to be good and kind to everyone. They should be smart, use spies to know what's happening, and save up their money. They should respect brave and wise people. They should help those who need it.

But if the king is angry, and he punishes or scares the nobles, they'll run away to the king's enemies. So, the king must be kind to his most important helpers. He should only talk to the most important ones and keep secrets with them.  He shouldn't tell everyone everything!

If the nobles fight amongst themselves, they become weak.  The wise nobles should quickly stop any arguments. If older nobles don't stop fights, the whole group will fall apart. The biggest danger for a king comes from inside, not from outside. A single fight can destroy everything. If nobles who are related start arguing, it's a bad sign! It's not strength, smarts, beauty, or riches that destroy noble groups. It's only disagreements and bribes that can do that.  So, working together is the most important thing for the nobles!"
