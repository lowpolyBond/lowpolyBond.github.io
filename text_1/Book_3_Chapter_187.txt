Long ago, King Yudhishthira asked the wise Markandeya, "You've lived for ages! You've seen the world end and begin again many times. Tell me, what happens?"

Markandeya smiled.  "I have.  I've seen the world disappear, the gods vanish, even Brahma, the great creator, go to sleep on a lotus flower.  Only I was left to watch."

"Then what?" asked the king.

"Then," said Markandeya, "Brahma wakes, and I help him create the world again.  I've seen this happen many, many times."

"But what about the end of the world?" Yudhishthira wanted to know.

"It's a long story," Markandeya said.  "The world goes through different ages.  First is the Krita Yuga, then Treta, Dwapara, and finally Kali Yuga. Each age is shorter than the last. In Kali Yuga, people become bad. They lie, they are greedy, and they don't follow the rules.  People don't worship properly, and the world becomes full of trouble."


"What happens then?" asked the king.

"Then," said Markandeya, "seven suns appear! They dry up all the water.  A huge fire burns everything â€“ trees, animals, even the gods!  Then, powerful storms come, and the whole world is flooded!"

"Oh no!" cried Yudhishthira.

"But it's not the end," Markandeya reassured him. "After the flood, I saw a giant banyan tree in the water.  On a branch, sitting on a beautiful shell bed, was a boy, glowing like the sun! He was so beautiful!"

"Who was he?" Yudhishthira gasped.

"I was scared and tired," Markandeya explained. "He told me to rest inside him.  I entered his mouth, and guess what? I was inside his tummy, and...his tummy was the whole world! I saw all the rivers, mountains, animals, and even the gods, all there inside him, like a tiny world inside a big one!"

"Wow!" said Yudhishthira.

"He was Vishnu, the protector," Markandeya said.  "He held the whole world inside him while it rested. When it was time, he let me out, and I saw the world reborn once more."

"So, the world ends and begins again?"

"Yes," Markandeya said. "And I've seen it happen many times.  The cycle always repeats."
