Once upon a time, a great king named Janamejaya was performing a huge sacrifice.  A wise man named Astika was there.  Astika said, "King, your sacrifice is amazing! It's as good as the best sacrifices ever done by gods like Soma, Varuna, and Prajapati!  It's even better than a hundred sacrifices done by the powerful god Indra!  It's as wonderful as the sacrifices of many famous kings and heroes from the past!"

Astika went on, praising the king's sacrifice again and again. He said it was like the best sacrifices ever performed.  He talked about how great the priests were; they were as bright as the sun!  The fire used in the sacrifice was special; it burned beautifully and carried the offerings to the gods.

Astika then praised King Janamejaya himself. He said, "King, you are a great protector of your people. You are fair and just, like the gods of justice! You are strong and brave, like many great heroes of the past. You are wise and peaceful, like the wisest saints! You are powerful and glorious, shining like the sun!"

After praising the king, the priests, and the sacrifice, Astika made everyone happy. King Janamejaya, seeing how wonderful everything was, was very pleased.  And thatâ€™s how Astika praised King Janamejaya's amazing sacrifice.
