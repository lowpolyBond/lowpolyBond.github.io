Once upon a time, during a great battle, young Abhimanyu, Arjuna's brave son, bravely fought the enemy army all by himself!  He was a young boy, but very strong and skilled. He rode his three little horses and went right into the middle of the enemy!

King Dhritarashtra wondered, "Did any of Yudhishthira's brave warriors follow Abhimanyu?"

Sanjaya, who was watching, answered, "Oh King, many warriors rushed to help Abhimanyu!  Yudhishthira, Bhima, and many others, all Abhimanyu's family and friends, followed him to rescue him from the enemy!"  But Jayadratha, a strong warrior from the enemy side, stopped them.  He was like a huge elephant, stopping all the Pandavasâ€™ brave soldiers.

Dhritarashtra was amazed.  "How could Jayadratha, all by himself, stop so many brave warriors?" he asked.

Sanjaya explained, "Long ago, Jayadratha was defeated by Bhima.  He was very ashamed! So, he prayed very hard to Lord Shiva. He went without food and water for a very long time. He did many difficult things to show how sorry he was.  Lord Shiva was pleased and gave Jayadratha a special gift: he could stop all the Pandava brothers in battle, except Arjuna!"

Because of this gift and his own strength, Jayadratha was able to hold off the Pandava army. His strong bow and arrows scared the Pandavas, but his power made the Kaurava army very happy! They all fought bravely alongside Jayadratha.
