Once upon a time, after a great war, King Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, about the most important things in life.  He wanted to know what everyone should do to be happy, no matter what their job was.

Bhishma said, "There are many ways to be good.  Being good is always worth it!  Everyone has their own path, but the best thing is to focus on making your soul happy.  Things like money and fancy toys aren't as important as you think.  When you think about it, they're like bits of straw!"

Yudhishthira then asked, "But what do I do when I'm sad? Like when I lose my money, or someone I love dies?"

Bhishma told a story.  A long time ago, King Senajit was very sad because his son died.  A wise man visited him and said, "Why are you so upset? Everyone is sad sometimes. Soon, others will be sad for *you*.  We all come from somewhere and we all go back.  Nothing stays the same."

King Senajit asked, "How can I not be sad?"

The wise man said, "I don't think of myself as separate from the world.  Everything is connected, like friends playing together, sometimes close, sometimes far apart.  Your son was here for a little while, and now he's gone. It's like two boats drifting on the ocean â€“ they meet, then they separate.  Sadness comes from wanting things too much.  Happiness and sadness come and go like a spinning wheel."

Bhishma explained that everything is decided by fate. Having friends or enemies, being smart or not, doesn't decide your happiness.  Only truly wise people, or those who are totally calm and peaceful, are truly happy.  Everyone else is somewhere in between, sometimes happy, sometimes sad.  The wise man knows this, and he doesn't let it bother him.

Bhishma then told another story, about a woman named Pingala. Pingala was a woman who worked at a special place, but she didn't get to see her friend that day, and she was upset. But then, she realized that true happiness comes from being calm and peaceful, not from getting what you want. She let go of her sadness.  She learned to be happy without wanting things.

Bhishma finished by saying, "King Senajit listened to the wise man, and he wasn't sad anymore. He felt happy and peaceful."  He told Yudhishthira that the best way to be happy is to be kind, calm, and not get angry, and to let go of wanting things too much.
