Arjuna, sad and heavy-hearted, went to see a wise old man, Vyasa.  Arjuna looked very unhappy. Vyasa asked him, "Arjuna, what's wrong?  Have you done something bad? Have you lost a battle?"

Arjuna sighed. "My dear friend Krishna, and many brave Yadava warriors, are all dead!  They killed each other in a terrible battle.  It was like a huge storm of weapons and blood.  Even Krishna, who was so strong and brave, couldn't stop it."

Arjuna's voice cracked.  "Even worse, many Yadava women were taken away by bad people.  I couldnâ€™t even lift my bow! I felt so weak and helpless.  Krishna is gone. He's no longer with me.   I don't want to live without him."

Vyasa, the wise old man, listened patiently. Then he said, "Arjuna, this was all part of a plan.  It was the end of an age, and it was their time to go.  Krishna, who was really a god, left his human form and returned to heaven.  He helped you win a great war, and now it's your time to move on too.  Your weapons will come back when they are needed.  It's time for you and your brothers to leave this world, too."

Arjuna felt a little better after talking to Vyasa.  He went back to his brother Yudhishthira and told him everything that happened.  It was a very sad time for everyone.
