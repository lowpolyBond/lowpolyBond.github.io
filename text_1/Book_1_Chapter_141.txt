Once upon a time, after a year had passed, King Dhritarashtra decided Yudhishthira, the eldest Pandava brother, should be the next king.  Yudhishthira was kind, brave, and honest. He was so good, he even did better than his own father!

His brother Bhima trained hard with a strong warrior named Sankarshana. He learned to fight with swords and maces and became super strong!  

Arjuna, another Pandava brother, was amazing with weapons! He was so quick and accurate, he could use any weapon perfectly.  His teacher, Drona, said there was no one better!

One day, Drona gave Arjuna a powerful weapon, the Brahmasira. It was like a thunderbolt!  But Drona warned Arjuna to only use it in extreme need and never against weak people.  Arjuna promised to listen. To receive the weapon, Arjuna had to promise to fight Drona when challenged.  Everyone cheered, saying Arjuna was the best archer ever!

Sahadeva learned all about being good and honest.  Nakula, another Pandava brother, also became a great warrior.

The Pandava brothers were incredibly strong!  They won many battles. They defeated powerful kings, even some that even their father couldn't beat!  They won so much treasure, they sent it all back to their kingdom.

But King Dhritarashtra, the Kaurava king, watched his nephews become so powerful, and he got scared and jealous.  From that day on, he couldn't sleep, worried about the Pandavas' strength.
