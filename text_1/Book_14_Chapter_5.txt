Once upon a time, a powerful god named Indra was angry.  A king named Marutta was very proud.  Indra didn't like this. He told another king, Dhritarashtra, "Tell Marutta to choose a wise teacher, or I'll strike him with my lightning bolt!"

Dhritarashtra went to King Marutta and delivered Indra's message.  Marutta said, "It's wrong to be disloyal to a friend!  But I won't choose Indra's teacher."

Dhritarashtra warned Marutta, "Indra's lightning is coming!"  Marutta was scared.  He went to his own wise teacher, Samvarta.

Samvarta said, "Don't worry! I have magic! Indra's lightning won't hurt you!"  Marutta was still worried.  He said, "I wish Indra would come to my special ceremony and see how much I respect him."

Samvarta used his magic.  Suddenly, Indra and all the other gods appeared!  They came to Marutta's ceremony.  Indra was very happy.  He said, "I'm not angry anymore!"

Samvarta told Indra, "Please help us make this ceremony even better!"  Indra helped.  He made a beautiful building for the ceremony.  Everyone had a wonderful time.

After the ceremony, Marutta gave lots of gold to the wise people. He was happy, and he lived a good life.  Yudhishthira, a great king, heard this story and wanted to have a big ceremony too, just like Marutta!
