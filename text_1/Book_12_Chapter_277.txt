King Yudhishthira was worried.  "Grandfather," he said, "Time keeps moving.  What's the best thing for us to do?"

Grandfather Bhishma smiled. "I'll tell you a story," he said. "A wise man had a very smart son named Medhavin. One day, Medhavin asked his father, 'Father, life is short.  What should a clever person do?'"

The father, who loved to study holy books, said, "Son, study the holy books, have children to carry on the family name, and do important ceremonies.  Then, go live peacefully in the forest and wait for your life to end."

But Medhavin was upset. "Father," he said, "Death is everywhere!  It's like a scary storm hitting us all.  How can you be so calm?"

His father was surprised. "What storm? What are you talking about?"

Medhavin explained, "Death is the storm! Old age is the wind! Every day and night is like a thunderclap, getting closer.  Death can come at any time! We're like fish in a puddle—we’re so vulnerable!"

"You're right," the father said.  "We should do good things today, not wait until tomorrow. Death doesn't wait for anyone. Do good, be kind, and don't waste time. Don't let Death catch you unprepared!"

Medhavin said, "People get busy with family and things they want, and then Death takes them away like a tiger grabbing a sleeping deer!  Or a wolf stealing a sheep!"

He added, "It doesn't matter if you're strong or weak, rich or poor, smart or not. Death takes everyone. The only way to fight Death is to be truthful and kind."

Medhavin decided to be good. He said he didn't need to have children, and would focus on being true, and helping others, instead.  He would be peaceful and calm.

Bhishma finished the story,  "Yudhishthira, the father listened to his son.  You should do the same. Be truthful and kind. That is the best way to live."
