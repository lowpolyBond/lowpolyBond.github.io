King Janamejaya asked, "After the great sage Vyasa left, what happened to King Dhritarashtra and his family?  What happened to Kripa and the others? I heard about Ashwatthama's powerful actions and the angry curses. What happened next?"

Vaishampayana, the storyteller, said, "After the big battle, when Duryodhana and many soldiers were dead, Sanjaya, who could see far away, lost his special sight. He went back to the blind King Dhritarashtra.  Sanjaya said, 'King, all the kings and soldiers from many lands are dead, including your sons. Your son Duryodhana, even though everyone begged for peace, wanted to fight and kill the Pandavas. He caused so much death!  Please, King, do the proper ceremonies for your sons, grandsons, and family members.'"

Vaishampayana continued, "When King Dhritarashtra heard this sad news, he fell to the ground. He looked lifeless. Vidura, a wise man, went to him and said, 'King, get up! Don't be so sad!  Everything in life ends.  People are born, they live, and then they die. That's how it is.  Being sad won't bring them back.  You can die without a battle, or live through one.  When it's your time, you can't escape.  Time takes everyone, good or bad. It's like a long journey, some people arrive a little sooner than others. Your sons were brave warriors. They died fighting bravely, and they went to heaven.  There's no better way for a warrior to die than in battle.  They were good people, brave and strong. Don't be sad, King.  Be strong.'"
