Once upon a time, in a great battle, two brave warriors fought!  Satyaki, a strong fighter, faced Bhuri.  They were like elephants charging!

Satyaki shot five sharp arrows into Bhuri's chest. Bhuri's blood flowed.  Bhuri fought back! He shot ten arrows into Satyaki's chest! Both warriors were very angry!  Their arrows flew like rain! It was a terrible fight!  They fought and fought, both hitting each other.

For a little while, they were equally strong.  Then, Satyaki, with a smile, broke Bhuri's bow! He quickly shot nine more arrows and yelled, "Wait! Wait!"  Bhuri shot three arrows back, then, smiling, he broke Satyaki's bow!

Satyaki, furious, threw a spear.  The spear hit Bhuri!  Bhuri fell from his chariot, covered in blood, like the sun falling from the sky.

Seeing Bhuri fall, another warrior, Aswatthaman, attacked Satyaki. He yelled, "Wait! Wait!" and rained arrows down on him like a storm.

Ghatotkacha, a giant warrior, roared, "Wait, Aswatthaman! You won't escape! I'll defeat you!"  He rushed at Aswatthaman, shooting huge arrows!

Aswatthaman fought back, dodging the arrows and shooting hundreds back! Ghatotkacha looked like a porcupine with its quills sticking out!

Then, Ghatotkacha's son, furious, shot many arrows at Aswatthaman!  They fought with all kinds of arrows – some sharp, some curved, some like a boar's ear!

Aswatthaman fought bravely, his arrows like magic!  The sky lit up with sparks from clashing arrows.

They fought in the dark night, like powerful gods fighting! Ghatotkacha hit Aswatthaman with ten fiery arrows. Aswatthaman fell, everyone thought he was dead!

But Aswatthaman got up! He shot a powerful arrow that hit Ghatotkacha, who became weak and had to leave the battle.

Another big fight happened between Bhima and Duryodhana! They shot arrows at each other, covering themselves in arrows.  Duryodhana broke Bhima’s bows again and again.  Finally, Bhima threw a huge iron spear. Duryodhana broke the spear! Bhima then threw his mighty mace, smashing Duryodhana's chariot!  Duryodhana quickly got into a new chariot. Bhima thought he'd killed Duryodhana, and roared loudly. Everyone thought Duryodhana was dead.

Then, Duryodhana’s friends were very sad, and many more warriors fought in a big, dark battle.
