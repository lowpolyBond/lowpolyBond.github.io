Bharata was telling his grandpa about a scary dream.  Suddenly, tired messengers arrived from his home, Ayodhya.

They bowed to Bharataâ€™s grandpa and his cousin, Yudhajita.  The messengers had a message: "Go back to Ayodhya!  Important things need you!" They gave Bharata beautiful clothes and jewels for his mom.

Bharata was worried. He asked, "Is my dad okay? Is Rama okay? Is Lakshmana okay?  Is Queen Kaushalya okay? Is my other mom, Sumitra, okay?  And what about my Mom Kaikeyi? What does she want?"

The messengers said, "Everyone you love is fine.  Hurry back!"

Bharata said, "I need to ask my grandpa for permission to leave."

Bharata told his grandpa, "I must go home quickly!  I'll visit again soon."

His grandpa, King Kaikeyi, hugged Bharata and said, "My dear Bharata, you are a good son. Tell your parents I said hello.  Give my greetings to the wise Vasishtha too, and to Rama and Lakshmana."

Grandpa Kaikeyi gave Bharata lots of presents: elephants, beautiful clothes, jewels, horses, and even strong guard dogs!  Yudhajita also gave Bharata two amazing elephants.

Bharata thanked everyone and hurried away. He felt sad because of his dream and needed to get home fast.

He got into his chariot with his brother Shatrughna.  Lots of servants, horses, camels, and other animals followed them.  A whole army went with him to protect him!  Bharata and Shatrughna rode away, feeling brave and ready to help their family.
