Once upon a time, in a faraway land, lived King Pandu and his queen, Kunti.  They wanted children very much.

First, Kunti prayed to Dharma, the god of justice, to give her a son.  Dharma came in a shining chariot, like the sun! He asked Kunti what she wanted, and she asked for a son.  Soon, a wonderful baby boy was born!  A magical voice boomed from the sky, saying the baby would be the best and most truthful king ever! He was named Yudhishthira.

Next, Pandu said, "A strong king is a good king!" So Kunti prayed to Vayu, the god of wind. Vayu arrived on a deer! He gave Kunti a strong, strong baby boy named Bhima.  Another magical voice said Bhima would be the strongest of all!  When Bhima was a tiny baby, he fell from his mother's lap onto a rock, and *smash!* the rock broke into pieces, but Bhima was fine!  That same day, another important baby was born, but he wasn't as nice: Duryodhana.

Pandu wanted an even better son, so he prayed to Indra, the king of the gods. He did many hard things, like standing on one leg all day!  Finally, Indra came and gave Kunti another son, named Arjuna.  

*Whoa!* This time, the magical voice was even louder! It said Arjuna would be super strong and brave, and he would be famous all over the world!  Many gods and goddesses came to celebrate Arjuna’s birth – it was a huge party in the sky!

After Arjuna was born, Kunti told Pandu, "We have three amazing sons! That's enough.  Having more babies with different gods is not right."  And so, the story of the Pandava brothers began.
