Once upon a time, in a faraway kingdom, lived a wise man named Vasishtha. He talked to Prince Rama, a very good boy.  Vasishtha said, "Rama, your parents and teacher are very important. Your parents gave you your body, and your teacher gives you wisdom."

He told Rama to be kind to everyone â€“ his family, friends, and the people in the kingdom.  He reminded Rama to always listen to his mother.  Vasishtha said, "Rama, you did the right thing by not taking the throne when your brother Bharata asked."

Rama listened carefully. He said, "My parents took such good care of me when I was little. I can't ever repay them for their love. I will always do what my father wants."

Bharata, Rama's brother, was very sad. He told his driver, Sumantra, "Make a bed of grass for me. I will sit here and wait until Rama agrees to come home!"  He sat down sadly in front of Rama.

Rama was surprised. He said, "Bharata, why are you doing this?  You are a prince! You shouldn't act like this. Please get up and go home!"

Bharata wouldn't move. He asked the other people, "Please ask Rama to come home!" But they said, "Rama is just following our father's wishes. We can't make him change his mind."

Rama heard this and said to Bharata, "Think about what your friends are saying. Get up, Bharata. You don't have to do this. Drink some water and come and touch me."

Bharata stood up. He said, "I don't want the kingdom. I didn't ask Mother to send Rama away! I didn't even know about it. If someone must live in the forest, I will go instead of Rama!"

Rama was amazed by Bharata's kindness. He said, "Bharata, we can't change what our father promised. I will go to the forest, but when I return, I will rule the kingdom with you."  Rama was happy that Bharata was so good and honest.  He knew that he and Bharata would always be the best of brothers.
