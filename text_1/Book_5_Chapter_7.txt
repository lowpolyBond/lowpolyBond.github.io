Once upon a time, the Pandavas needed help for a big war.  They sent messages to many kings.  Arjun, a brave Pandava prince, went to see Krishna, a powerful friend.  Duryodhana, the mean prince from the other side, also raced to Krishna on his fast horses.

He got there first, but Arjun arrived shortly after.  Krishna was sleeping!  Duryodhana sat down by Krishna's bed.  Arjun came in and stood politely.  When Krishna woke up, he saw Arjun first.

Duryodhana asked Krishna for his army to help in the war. He said, "We're both your friends. I got here first, so you should help me!"

Krishna was clever. He said, "You came first, that's true. But I saw Arjun first.  I have a huge army.  One of you can have me, but I won't fight. The other will get my powerful army."

Arjun got to choose first.  He chose Krishna, even though Krishna wouldn't fight.  Duryodhana got Krishna's amazing army.  He was happy, even though Krishna wasn't fighting for him.

Duryodhana also talked to another strong warrior, but he refused to help either side.  Then Duryodhana got more soldiers from someone else.

After Duryodhana left, Krishna asked Arjun, "Why did you choose me? I won't even fight!"

Arjun replied, "I know you're strong, and you're famous.  I want you to be my chariot driver!"

Krishna smiled and said, "That's a good choice! I'll drive your chariot."

Then Arjun, happy to have Krishna by his side, went back to his brothers.  He had the best chariot driver in the world!
