Yudhishthira asked his grandpa Bhishma, "Grandpa, you said we can reach freedom, but how?  Tell me the way!"

Bhishma smiled. "Yudhishthira, that's a great question!  It's like making a clay pot.  Once you finish the pot, you don't need to think about making it anymore.  Reaching freedom is like that.  You need to follow a path."

He explained, "There's only one way to freedom. It's not like other paths.  Listen carefully:

* **Control your anger:** Forgive others.
* **Control your wants:** Don't always wish for things.
* **Control your sleep:** Stay awake and think good thoughts.
* **Control your fear:** Be brave and careful.
* **Control your breath:** Think about your inner self.
* **Control your bad feelings:** Be patient with others.
* **Control your bad thoughts:** Learn the truth.  Learn new things.
* **Control your health:** Eat simple food.
* **Control your greed:** Be happy with what you have.
* **Control your bad actions:** Be kind to everyone.
* **Control your worries:** Don't worry about the future.
* **Control your love of things:** Let go of things you own.  Don't get attached to things.
* **Control your hunger:** Practice yoga.
* **Control your pride:** Be humble.
* **Control your cravings:** Be content.
* **Control your laziness:** Work hard.
* **Control your doubts:** Be sure of yourself.
* **Control your talking:** Don't talk too much.
* **Control your fears:** Be brave.

Control your words and your mind.  Control your understanding.  Control your knowledge.  And finally, control your inner self.  You do this by being good and calm.  You need to stop wanting things, being angry, being greedy, being scared, and sleeping too much. You must be truthful and kind. You must be pure in your heart and actions.

By doing all these things, you'll become stronger, get rid of bad things you've done, get what you want, and learn lots of things. Then, you'll be ready for freedom.  Freedom comes from knowing the truth, not wanting things, being kind and forgiving, and being strong through yoga. It means letting go of worries and not being attached to your home or family. This path is beautiful, clean, and pure. It’s also about controlling what you say, do, and think, because you don’t want things anymore."
