Once, in a big battle, Drona, a super strong warrior, had his arrows blocked.  Yuyudhana, a brave fighter, saved him.  Dhritarashtra, the king, wanted to know what happened next.

Sanjaya, who was watching, told him:  "Drona got really angry!  He was like a huge, angry snake, his bow was his big mouth, and his arrows were his sharp teeth.  He zoomed towards Yuyudhana in his fast chariot, shooting golden arrows."

Yuyudhana saw Drona coming.  He was like a storm of arrows and rumbling wheels! Yuyudhana told his driver, "Go fast! Let's face that angry teacher!"

The two warriors fought!  Thousands of arrows flew everywhere.  The sky was full of arrows, it was so dark you couldn't even see the sun!  The wind stopped. It was a really, really big fight!

It sounded like thunder! The warriors were covered in blood.  Their chariots and horses were hit too.  Everybody else stopped fighting to watch this amazing battle.

Yuyudhana was so fast! He kept cutting Dronaâ€™s bows, nine times!  Drona was amazed.  He thought, "This warrior is as strong as Rama, Arjuna, and other great heroes!"

Then Drona used a super-powerful magic arrow. Yuyudhana used his own magic arrow! The two magic arrows crashed into each other and disappeared!

The sun was setting.  Yudhishthira and his brothers rushed to help Yuyudhana.  Dhritarashtra's army came to protect Drona.  A huge battle started, with so much dust and arrows flying around, nobody could see anything!
