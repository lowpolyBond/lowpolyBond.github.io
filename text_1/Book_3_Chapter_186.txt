Once upon a time, a very good king named Yudhishthira asked a wise man named Markandeya, "Tell me the story of Manu!"

Markandeya said, "Long ago, there was a super strong and holy man named Manu. He was so powerful and good, he was almost like a god! He wanted to be even better, so he prayed very hard in a forest. He stood on one leg for ten thousand years!  One day, a tiny fish swam up to him and said, 'Please help me! Big fish want to eat me!'"

Manu felt sorry for the fish. He picked it up and put it in a small bowl. The fish grew bigger and bigger! Soon, it was too big for the bowl.  "I need a bigger home!" the fish said.

Manu moved the fish to a big pond.  But the fish grew even bigger!  It was too big for the pond!  "Please, take me to the river Ganga!" the fish begged.

Manu took the fish to the Ganga River.  But the fish kept growing! Finally, it said, "Please take me to the ocean!"

Manu carefully carried the giant fish to the ocean.  The fish smiled and said, "Thank you!  A big flood is coming! Build a big boat, take seven wise men, and collect all kinds of seeds.  I'll come back to help you!"

Manu did exactly what the fish said.  He built a huge boat and gathered the seeds. When the flood came, the water covered everything!  Then, the fish came back. It looked like a giant animal with horns! Manu tied a rope to the fish, and the fish pulled the boat to safety!

They floated for a long, long time.  The boat rocked and swayed, but Manu and the wise men stayed safe.  Finally, the fish pulled the boat to a high mountain.  "I am Brahma, the great god!" the fish said. "I saved you. Now Manu, you will create a new world!"

And that's how Manu created the world again, after the big flood! The story teaches us that being kind and brave can help us even when things get really, really tough. And that's the story of the fish!
