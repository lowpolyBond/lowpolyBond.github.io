The Pandava brothers were sad and worried.  Their wise teacher, Dhaumya, saw this. He was like a super-smart, wise man. Dhaumya said, "Don't worry, my brave princes! I know of many special places.  Visiting them will make you feel better."

Dhaumya told them about a wonderful eastern land.  There was a place called Naimisha, loved by the gods.  There were many holy rivers and lakes there, including the beautiful Gomati River.  He told them about Mount Gaya, a very holy mountain with a special lake called Brahmasara.  People believed that if even one son in a family visited Gaya, it would bring good luck to ten generations!  There was a huge banyan tree there, too, where food offered to ancestors would last forever.

He talked about the holy Ganges River, where a great king did many good deeds.  He mentioned a forest called Utpala where a powerful man, Viswamitra, became a holy man.  He also spoke of Prayaga, where a very important river joined another. This was a very special place, where the gods themselves had performed sacred rituals.

Dhaumya also mentioned other places: Agastyaâ€™s hermitage, a holy mountain called Mahendra, and Kedara, a sacred place that was far away.  He told them about a mountain called Kundoda, where a king once rested.  There were many holy forests and rivers, too.

"These are just the holy places in the east," Dhaumya said. "I'll tell you about the other parts of the world next!"  The Pandavas felt a little bit better after hearing about all these amazing places.  They knew that even though things were hard now, there were wonderful places to visit and amazing things to learn about.
