King Dhritarashtra was worried.  His wise uncle, Vidura, gave him some advice. Vidura said some people are like fools. They try to do impossible things, like punching air or catching sunbeams!

He listed some foolish things people do:

* Trying to control someone who can't be controlled.
* Being happy with very little.
* Being nice to their enemies.
* Trying to stop women from being women.
* Asking the wrong people for gifts.
* Boasting about what they've done.
* Doing bad things even if they're from a good family.
* Fighting someone much stronger.
* Talking to someone who's laughing at them.
* Wanting things they can't have.
* Making jokes with their daughter-in-law.
* Boasting that their daughter-in-law calmed them down.
* Planting seeds in someone else's garden.
* Saying mean things about their wife.
* Pretending they don't remember something they were given.
* Boasting about giving things away but not actually giving them.
* Lying and trying to make people believe it.

Vidura said, "These people are punished! Treat others how they treat you. Be honest with honest people, but you can be tricky with tricky people." He explained that some things destroy happiness: old age destroys beauty, impatience destroys hope, and death destroys life.  Bad friends take away your goodness, and anger takes away your good luck. Pride destroys everything!


Dhritarashtra asked why not everyone lives to be 100 years old.  Vidura answered, “Too much pride, talking too much, overeating, anger, wanting too much fun, and fighting among yourselves – these things shorten your life!  They kill you, not death itself."

Vidura also talked about serious sins, like:

* Taking someone's wife who trusted you.
* Being unfaithful to your teacher.
* A priest marrying someone not of his class, or drinking alcohol.
* Hurting priests or taking their land.
* Killing someone who asked you for help.

These are very bad things, Vidura said.  But good things lead to a happy life after death: being kind, following the rules, being generous, thanking people, and always being good.

Vidura said it's hard to find people who say kind things, but even harder to find people who say tough but helpful truths.  A good advisor tells the king the truth, even if it’s hard to hear.  He compared sacrificing things: one person for a family, a family for a village, a village for a kingdom, and the whole world for your soul!  Protect your things, your family, and yourself. Don’t gamble, it causes trouble.

Vidura warned Dhritarashtra against fighting the Pandavas. He said the Pandavas are like strong tigers, and Dhritarashtra's sons are like weak jackals.  “You're protecting jackals while ignoring lions!” he cried.  "You'll be sorry!"

Vidura gave Dhritarashtra advice on how to choose good advisors and servants. Good servants are humble, helpful, honest, and kind.  Bad servants are proud and argue. Don’t trust people who are always with bad company.   Don’t borrow or lend money to certain people:  very kind people, bad women, servants, sons, brothers, widows with babies, soldiers, or people who have lost everything.

Good qualities are wisdom, good family, knowing the scriptures, self-control, bravery, not talking too much, giving what you can, and being thankful.  Being kind brings you many good things.  Eating less gives you good health, a long life, and healthy children.  Don’t keep bad people in your house: those who are mean, eat too much, are hated, are liars, are cruel, are bad at timing things, and dress badly.  Also, don't ask these people for help: greedy people, those who say bad things about others, those who don’t understand the rules, people who live in the forest, tricky people, cruel people, and those who are always fighting.   Don’t work for those who are mean, liars, don't believe in God, are unkind, and think they know everything.

Vidura said to provide for your children and give your daughters good husbands before retiring to the forest. Do what is good for everyone, it brings happiness.  A smart, strong, and hardworking person never needs to worry about food.

Vidura ended by warning Dhritarashtra again about fighting the Pandavas. It would create family conflict, worry, bad reputation, and make enemies happy.  “Don’t fight the Pandavas," Vidura said. "The Pandavas are the tigers, and you are the forest. You need each other."  Bad people look for flaws, not good qualities. Doing good brings success.   A good person understands everything. Following virtue, wealth, and desires at the right time brings happiness. A person who can control their emotions and stay calm during trouble will succeed.


Vidura listed five types of strength: physical strength (the weakest), good advisors, wealth, good birth, and intelligence (the strongest). Don't trust women, kings, snakes, your boss, enemies, pleasure, or your life. There’s no cure for foolishness. Don't ignore snakes, fire, lions, or family. Powerful people are like fire –quiet but strong. Dhritarashtra is like a vine and the Pandavas are like the trees. Vines need trees to survive; and trees need vines.
