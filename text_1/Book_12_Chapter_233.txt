Once upon a time, a wise old storyteller named Vyasa explained how the world ends.  He said it's like the sun setting at night, but much bigger!

Imagine twelve suns blazing at once!  A giant fire starts, hotter than anything you can imagine. Everything on Earth – people, animals, trees, even the ground itself – disappears into the fire. The Earth becomes empty like a giant turtle shell.

Then, the fire turns into water.  The water roars and splashes, filling everything.  But even the water disappears, turning into fire again.  The fire gets bigger and brighter, burning up even the air.

Next, the fire turns into wind.  The wind howls and swirls, until it disappears too, becoming quiet like a whisper.  Then, only space is left.  Space is empty and silent, like a dream.

Even this space disappears.  Everything becomes one with Mind, which is like a big thought.  This Mind is then swallowed up by the Moon!

The Moon, which is also called Sankalpa, is like a giant wish.  A very long time later, even this wish disappears, leaving only Iswara, which is a powerful and wise being.  Iswara is like a super-smart superhero.

Then, time itself disappears, followed by energy.  Finally, even knowledge disappears, being swallowed by Iswara. Iswara is everything, and is like the quiet, powerful creator of everything.  It is the greatest and most powerful thing there is.

Iswara is like the sun at the end of a very long night. Then it all starts again!  That's how the world is created and destroyed, again and again, over and over.  Each part of this cycle is called a Yuga, and it takes a very, very long time!
