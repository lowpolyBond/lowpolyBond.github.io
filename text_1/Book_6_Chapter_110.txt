Once upon a time, during a big war, King Dhritarashtra asked, "Tell me about the battle! How did Sikhandin, a brave prince, fight against the powerful Bhishma?  Who helped protect Sikhandin?"

His advisor, Sanjaya, explained, "Bhishma's chariot and bow were fine. He was a great warrior, and he fought very bravely.  He killed many soldiers from your army, King. The Pandavas and their friends couldn't stop him!  On the tenth day, Bhishma was incredibly strong, like a super hero!"

Sanjaya continued, "Then, Arjuna, a very strong Pandava warrior, arrived!  He roared like a lion and shot many arrows.  Arjuna was so brave that your soldiers ran away scared! Duryodhana, your son, was very worried. He said to Bhishma, 'Arjuna is destroying our army!  We need your help!'"

Duryodhana begged Bhishma for help. Bhishma had made a promise to Duryodhana, that he would kill many warriors each day.  He said, "I've kept my promise, Duryodhana. Today, I will either die or win the battle for you! I will fight with all my might!"

So Bhishma fought even harder. He killed many, many soldiers. He was so strong that even the bravest Pandava warriors couldn't look at him without fear. He was like the sun, shining brightly!

The Pandavas, along with their friends, fought bravely against Bhishma. It was a huge, fierce battle, with many, many soldiers fighting all around Bhishma! Your sons, King, helped protect Bhishma.  The battle was very, very intense!
