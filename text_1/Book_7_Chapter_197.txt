Once upon a time, during a great battle, a powerful weapon was used.  Whoosh!  Violent winds blew, and it rained even though the sky was clear. BOOM! Thunder roared. The ground shook! The ocean raged! Rivers flowed backward! Mountains cracked!  Scary animals ran past the good guys, the Pandavas. It got dark.  Even the gods and other magical beings were scared! Everyone wondered what was happening.  It was all because of a very powerful weapon used by Aswatthaman, Drona's son.

King Dhritarashtra asked his advisor, Sanjaya, "What did the Pandavas do when they saw the Kauravas, led by Aswatthaman, coming back to fight again after they'd lost their teacher, Drona?"

Sanjaya said, "After Drona, the teacher, was killed, like a mighty demon was slain by a god, many Kauravas ran away. Some crashed their chariots, others fell off their horses, some were trampled by elephants. It was total chaos! Then, a HUGE noise filled the air.  It sounded like the whole world was ending.  Yudhishthira, the Pandava king, asked Arjuna, his brother, 'Who is making all this noise? Who is leading the Kauravas back to battle?'"

Arjuna answered, "It's Aswatthaman!  He's strong and brave, like a raging elephant. He's very angry because Dhrishtadyumna, a Pandava warrior, tricked and killed his father, Drona.  Yudhishthira, you tricked Drona into thinking Aswatthaman was dead.  That wasn't fair!  Drona was a good teacher, but you lied to him so he'd stop fighting, and then he was killed. This was a very bad thing to do!"

Yudhishthira felt terrible. He said, "I lied to save our kingdom, but it was wrong. Iâ€™m so ashamed! I feel like I've already gone to hell. We killed our teacher, who was old, wise, and had put down his weapons! It was a terrible, terrible thing to do."
