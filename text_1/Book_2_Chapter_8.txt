Once upon a time, in a faraway kingdom, lived a queen named Kaikeyi.  Her son, Bharata, was very dear to her.  One day, everyone was happy because Rama, the older prince, was going to become king.

But a wicked woman named Manthara was jealous.  She didn't like Rama. She whispered terrible things to Queen Kaikeyi. "This is bad news, Queen," she hissed, throwing away a precious jewel. "You think you're happy, but you're about to be very sad! Rama is clever and dangerous. He will get rid of Bharata to become king. He will be all powerful, and your Bharata will be left with nothing."

Manthara went on and on. "Rama will be king, and he will be the boss of everyone. He will be like a big, strong lion, and your Bharata will be helpless!" She was so good at convincing Queen Kaikeyi that Queen Kaikeyi started to believe everything she said.

Queen Kaikeyi loved Rama, but she was worried about her son Bharata. She thought, "Rama is kind and good. He’ll take care of everyone," she said. "Bharata will have his turn to be king someday."

But Manthara wouldn’t stop. "No, Queen," she said, "If Rama is king, Bharata will be alone and heartbroken. He might not even survive. You must protect your son, your dearest Bharata!"

Manthara convinced Queen Kaikeyi that Rama was a danger to Bharata.  She filled Kaikeyi's mind with fear and anger. In the end, Queen Kaikeyi, believing Manthara’s lies, made a terrible choice.

She asked the king to send Rama away to the forest and make Bharata king instead.  This was the beginning of a very sad story.
