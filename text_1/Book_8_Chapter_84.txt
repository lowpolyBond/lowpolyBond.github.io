Once, after Bhima defeated Duhshasana, ten brave Kaurava brothers got really angry.  They were great warriors! They all shot arrows at Bhima to stop him. Bhima was strong and looked fierce, like a powerful monster!

But Arjuna, Bhima's brother, was even faster. He shot ten golden arrows!  Whoosh! The ten brothers fell down.  The Kaurava army was scared and ran away.

Karna, a Kaurava warrior, saw this and got worried.  His friend Shalya told him, "Don't be afraid!  Everyone is running. Duryodhana is sad because of Duhshasana. Kripa and the others are with him." Shalya told Karna, "You must fight Arjuna!  The whole war depends on you!  If you win, you'll be famous. If you lose, you'll still go to heaven! Your son, Vrishasena, is already fighting!"

Karna knew he had to fight. Vrishasena, Karna's son, attacked Nakula, another Pandava brother.  Nakula was super strong, too! He broke Vrishasena’s flag and his bow with his arrows.

Vrishasena got a new bow and shot many arrows at Nakula. Nakula fought back bravely, his arrows like flaming torches!  Vrishasena even broke Nakula's chariot’s wheels.  Nakula jumped off and fought on foot, dodging arrows like a bird!  He killed lots of soldiers!

Vrishasena kept shooting at Nakula, hitting him many times. Nakula got hurt but kept fighting, helped by his brother Bhima.  They fought and fought!

Finally, Sahadeva, another Pandava brother, saw Nakula in trouble. He told Arjuna, “Nakula needs help! Karna’s son is too strong!”  Arjuna, ready for battle, rushed to help his brothers.
