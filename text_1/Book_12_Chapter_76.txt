Once upon a time, in the land of Bharatavarsha, a wise king named Yudhishthira asked his grandfather, Bhishma, a very important question.  He said, "Grandpa, some priests are really good, and some are not so good. What's the difference?"

Bhishma, the wise old warrior, smiled and explained. "Yudhishthira," he said, "some priests are so wise and kind, they are like Brahma, the creator god! They know all the sacred texts and treat everyone the same.  They are like gods themselves!"

"But," Bhishma continued, "some priests don't follow the rules. They are not well-behaved, and they do bad things.  They are like ordinary people, not special at all."

Bhishma then listed some priests who weren't very good.  There were priests who:

* Did jobs for money, like working in courts or performing rituals for others.
* Performed sacrifices for farmers and commoners.
* Even worked as village priests!
* Sailed the seas instead of studying sacred texts.

These priests, Bhishma said, were like the lowest class of people, the Chandals.

"Some priests," Bhishma explained, "do other jobs. Some become advisors to kings, or messengers, or even soldiers.  These priests are like warriors (Kshatriyas)!"

"Others become merchants or farmers, just like ordinary people (Vaisyas)," Bhishma added.  "A good king can take taxes from these priests, but not from the really good ones. Kings only control the wealth of everyone *except* the very best priests."

Bhishma said it was very important for a king to make sure all priests followed the rules.  If a priest did something wrong, like stealing, the king had to punish him.  If a good priest was stealing only because he was very poor, then the king had to give him food and money.  But if the priest kept stealing, the king had to send him and his family away.

"A king is responsible for what happens in his kingdom, even if it's a priest doing wrong!" Bhishma finished.  "He has to make sure everyone is good and behaves properly."
