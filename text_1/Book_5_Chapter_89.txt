One sunny morning, Krishna woke up.  He finished his prayers and said goodbye to his friends.  He was going to the Kuru city!  Everyone in his town waved goodbye to the strong, big-armed Krishna.

Many important people came to greet Krishna.  Bhishma, Drona, Kripa, and many of Dhritarashtra's sons (except Duryodhana) were there. Thousands of people came too! They all wanted to see Krishna.  The city was beautifully decorated with jewels and bright colors.  Everyone came out to see him â€“ men, women, and children! They cheered and bowed down as he passed by.  Krishna's horse was slow because there were so many people!

Krishna went to Dhritarashtra's palace.  Dhritarashtra, the king, stood up to greet Krishna, along with Bhishma, Drona, and others.  Krishna showed respect to the king. Then he greeted all the other kings.  Dhritarashtra offered Krishna a special seat and gave him gifts of milk, honey, and water. Krishna sat and chatted happily with everyone.

After a while, Krishna left the palace. He went to see Vidura. Vidura was so happy to see him! He gave Krishna many gifts and asked him how the Pandava brothers were doing.  Krishna knew Vidura was a good friend of the Pandavas, so he told Vidura everything about them.
