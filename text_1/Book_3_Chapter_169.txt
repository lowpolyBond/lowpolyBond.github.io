Arjuna was fighting a big battle!  Lots of scary demons called Nivata-Kavachas attacked him. They threw spears, axes, and clubs at his chariot.  It was like a huge storm of weapons!

Arjuna was brave. He shot arrows from his amazing bow, the Gandiva.  He hit each demon ten times!  His chariot driver, Matali, was super-skilled. He drove the horses so fast, they swirled and dodged the demons, like the wind!

The demons kept coming.  They threw more and more weapons.  Arjuna's chariot rattled, and the demons fell by the hundreds.  Some demons even got caught up in the chariot's wheels!

Arjuna got a little worried.  So many demons! But then he saw how amazing Matali was, driving those super-fast horses.  It gave him courage!

Arjuna fought harder. He used his magic arrows and defeated thousands more demons. His chariot driver, Matali, was so happy to see Arjuna fight so bravely!

The demons tried a new trick. They threw even more weapons.  Arjuna used his special weapon, the powerful thunderbolt, and cut the demons' weapons to pieces.

It was a huge battle, with arrows flying everywhere like buzzing bees.  The demons hit Arjuna too, but he sliced their arrows in half with his own!  He kept fighting, and kept winning.  He hit so many demons, they bled like rivers flowing down a mountain.

Finally, the demons tried to trick Arjuna with magic. But even magic couldn't stop Arjuna! He was too strong!
