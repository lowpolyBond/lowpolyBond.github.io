Once upon a time, the five Pandava brothers – Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva –  were traveling with their sister-in-law, Draupadi, and some wise Brahmins. They were going to a magical mountain called Gandhamadana.

Their journey was exciting! They walked past sparkling lakes, rushing rivers, tall mountains, and forests full of amazing trees.  These trees had delicious fruits and beautiful flowers all year round.  Even magical creatures lived there!

The Pandavas were very brave. They ate simple fruits and roots, and carefully watched where they stepped. They saw all sorts of wild animals!

Suddenly, a HUGE windstorm hit! It was so strong that it blew dust and leaves everywhere.  It was so dark and dusty that the brothers couldn't see each other!  They heard loud crashing noises from trees falling down.  They were scared! They thought the sky or the mountains were falling apart!

To stay safe, they quickly hid. Bhima, the strongest, protected Draupadi under a tree. Yudhishthira and his teacher Dhaumya hid deep in the forest. Sahadeva, who carried a sacred fire, hid in a cave. Nakula and the Brahmins found shelter under different trees.

When the wind stopped, a big rain started!  It was like a huge waterfall from the sky! The rain was so heavy that it created rushing rivers. The rivers were full of foam and mud, and they even carried away trees!

After the storm, the Pandavas all found each other again. They were wet and a little scared, but safe!  They took a deep breath, and continued their journey to the magical Gandhamadana mountain.
