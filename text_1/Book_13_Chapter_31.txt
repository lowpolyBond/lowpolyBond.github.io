Once upon a time, a wise king named Yudhishthira asked his great-uncle Bhishma, "Uncle, who deserves the most respect in the whole world?"

Bhishma said, "I'll tell you a story.  It's about Narada and Krishna."

Narada, a holy man, was seen bowing to many Brahmins (wise priests).  Krishna, a powerful warrior, asked, "Narada, who are you bowing to with so much respect?"

Narada answered, "Krishna, I bow to Brahmins who worship the gods â€“ like the sun god, the wind god, the rain god, and the fire god. I honor Brahmins who are kind, patient, and always study holy books.  I respect those who are happy with what they have, and who share their food with others."

Narada continued, "I honor Brahmins who live simply, in forests, eating only fruits and roots.  I respect those who are always polite to guests and share their food. I admire those who study holy books all day and teach others. I honor those who are kind to everyone, and those who are always truthful and honest. I also respect those who are devoted to their teachers, and those who have given up their desires for worldly things. I admire those who live a simple life and only have what they truly need."

Narada finished, "I bow to those who are peaceful, always truthful and kind to everyone, and who always remember the gods.  I respect the wisest and oldest teachers, those who teach everyone and help them understand the world."

Bhishma then said to Yudhishthira, "So, you see, you should also always respect the gods, your ancestors, wise priests, and your guests. If you do this, good things will come to you!"
