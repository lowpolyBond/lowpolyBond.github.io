Once upon a time, a wise man named Bharadwaja asked another wise man, Bhrigu, "What makes someone a Brahmana (priest), a Kshatriya (warrior), a Vaisya (farmer/merchant), or a Sudra (worker)?"

Bhrigu smiled.  "A Brahmana is someone who is very good and kind," he said. "They study holy books, pray, and help others. They always share their food and are respectful to their teachers. They are honest and truthful."

"A Kshatriya is a brave warrior who also studies holy books and helps people. They fight to protect others and share their wealth," Bhrigu explained.

"A Vaisya works hard, maybe farming or trading. They are good people who study and make sure they have enough to live on," Bhrigu continued.

"A Sudra works hard at many jobs. But if they learn to be good and kind, even a Sudra can be as good as any other person."

Bhrigu added, "It's not just about what job you have, but about how you act.  Being angry and greedy is bad. We should be good, and try very hard to control our anger and greed. We should protect our good qualities from bad influences."

He said, "The best people are kind to everyone and don't want anything for themselves. They pray every day and help everyone they can.  They don't let anything upset them. They are at peace with themselves. They focus on things we can’t see with our eyes—things like kindness and truth."

"To find true peace," Bhrigu said, "you need to believe in goodness and focus on good things. Then you can be happy, here and forever."  A true Brahmana is always pure, kind, and compassionate to everyone.
