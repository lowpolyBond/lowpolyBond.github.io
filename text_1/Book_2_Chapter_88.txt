Bharata and his friends went to a special place.  They saw where Rama, his brother, had slept.  Rama had to live in the forest.

Bharata looked at the grassy bed. He said, "Rama, who slept in a beautiful palace with soft beds and golden floors, slept here on the hard ground!  His palace had parrots and sweet music.  Now he hears only wild animals!"

Bharata was very sad. He saw tiny bits of gold and silk from Sita's beautiful clothes. Sita is Rama's wife. She slept on the ground too!

"Rama and Sita slept here," Bharata said to his mothers.  "They are so kind.  I made Rama go to the forest. I feel terrible!"

Bharata thought about Lakshmana, Rama's best friend, who stayed with him.  He thought about Sita, who stayed with Rama even in the forest.  Bharata was sad because he was not with them.

Bharata said, "Our city, Ayodhya, is sad without Rama.  It's like a ship without a captain.  Everyone is unhappy."

Bharata decided to do something. He would live like a hermit in the forest.  He'd sleep on the ground and eat simple food.  His brother Shatrughna would stay with him.  Lakshmana would go back to help Rama.

"I hope Rama comes back soon," Bharata prayed. "If he doesn't want me to help, I'll be his servant in the forest forever!"
