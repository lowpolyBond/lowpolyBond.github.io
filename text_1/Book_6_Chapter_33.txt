Long ago, a wise teacher spoke to a brave prince named Arjuna.  He said, "I'll share a secret with you, a special kind of knowledge.  It's like a magical key that sets you free from sadness and trouble."

This secret is very special.  It's easy to learn, and it's always true.  People who don't believe this secret can't find true happiness. They keep coming back to this world again and again.

The teacher explained, "I am everywhere, like the air we breathe.  Everything is part of me, but I'm not stuck inside of things.  Think of it like the air filling a room – the air is everywhere, but it's not the room itself."  He showed his great power.  He creates everything, but he isn't part of everything.

The teacher said, "At the end of time, everything returns to me. Then, I create it all again. I do this without getting tied down." He's like a great artist who paints a beautiful picture, but doesn't become the picture itself.

Some people don't understand this. They are confused and only believe in things they can see.  But good people, those with kind hearts, understand and worship the teacher. They always remember him and think of him with love. They are always happy.

The teacher said, "I am everything! I am the sun, the rain, the food we eat. I am the prayers we say, and the songs we sing. I am the beginning and the end, the good and the bad.”

People who are good and worship the teacher go to a wonderful place after they die. But even after enjoying that wonderful place, they come back to this world again. Only those who truly understand the secret can escape this cycle.

The teacher said, “Even if you make mistakes, if you worship me, you will be okay.  I accept your gifts, no matter how small – a flower, a leaf, some water. Just offer them with a good heart.”

“Whatever you do, eat, drink, or give, do it as a gift to me. This way, you will be free from worry.”  The teacher said, “Be kind, and think of me.  Then you will come to me.”  Everyone is equal to the teacher; nobody is hated or loved more than another.  But those who worship the teacher with a loving heart, will always be close to him.
