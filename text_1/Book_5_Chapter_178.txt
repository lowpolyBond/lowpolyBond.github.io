Once upon a time, in a forest, lived a princess named Amva.  She was very sad.  Wise holy men were taking care of her.

They talked about what to do. Some said, "Let's send her home to her father." Others felt bad for her. Some suggested asking the Salwa king to marry her.  But others said, "No, he already refused her."

After a while, the holy men said to Amva, "Dear princess, we can't help you much here.  Don't live in this hard forest! Go home to your father. He'll take care of you."  They explained that a woman's father or husband protects her.  Living in the forest was too difficult, especially for a princess.

Amva said, "I can't go home! My family would be ashamed of me."  She wanted to stay and be a holy woman, so she wouldn't be sad again.

Then, a very important holy man arrivedâ€”King Hotravahana! He was Amva's grandfather!  He listened to Amva's story. He felt so sorry for her!  He hugged her and comforted her.

He said, "Don't go back! I'll help you.  Go see the great holy man Rama. He's very strong. He can help you, and he can even make Bhishma, the man who caused your sadness, do what's right!"

Amva asked, "How will I find him?"

Hotravahana said, "Rama lives on Mount Mahendra.  Tell him I sent you. He'll help you!"  Just then, Rama's friend arrived! Everyone greeted him.

King Hotravahana asked about Rama.  The friend said, "Rama will be here tomorrow. He's a friend of yours." Then he asked about Amva.

Hotravahana told him everything: Amva was the King of Kasi's daughter. Bhishma, a powerful prince, took her and her sisters away during their wedding ceremony.  Amva didn't want to marry Bhishma's brother.  Bhishma let her go, but the Salwa king also refused her.  Now she was very sad.

Amva agreed with her grandfather's story. She said, "I can't go home. I'll do whatever Rama says."
