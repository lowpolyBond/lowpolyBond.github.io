Long ago, in a land far away, there was a big war.  King Duryodhana was very sad.  His friend Kripa had tried to help him make peace with his cousins, the Pandavas.

"Kripa, you’re a good friend," said Duryodhana, taking a deep breath. "But your words are like bad medicine to someone who's dying.  The Pandavas won't trust me.  We cheated them before.  We tricked them at a game and took away their kingdom! We even tricked Krishna, their friend."

Duryodhana was still sad.  He remembered how his brother, Duhshasana, had been mean to Draupadi, the Pandavas’ sister-in-law.  He remembered how Draupadi cried.  He remembered how Abhimanyu, Draupadi's son, had been killed in battle.

"Arjuna is very angry," Duryodhana said. "Bhima is furious!  He made a promise to take revenge.  Even Dhrishtadyumna and Shikhandi want to fight me!  Krishna, Draupadi's husband, is also very sad. He will never forget what we did."

Duryodhana sighed. "Even Subhadra, Krishna’s sister, is helping Draupadi. They all want revenge.  It's too late for peace. We have fought so hard and won many battles. We must keep fighting!"

Duryodhana remembered all the good things he had done. He gave gifts to the wise people, helped those in need, and ruled his kingdom well. But he said that dying in a great battle was much better than dying in his bed, alone and sad.

"I don’t want to live a quiet life," he told Kripa. "I want to die a warrior's death. I want to go to heaven, where brave warriors go! My friends who died fighting for me… they’re already there. I’ll join them."

All the other warriors cheered Duryodhana's words.  They were ready to fight!  They bathed in a river, rested for the night, and waited for the next battle. They were ready to fight, no matter what.
