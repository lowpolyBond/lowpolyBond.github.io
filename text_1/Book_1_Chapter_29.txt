Once upon a time, a wise bird named Garuda had a problem.  A priest and his wife got stuck in Garuda's throat!  Garuda was very kind. He said, "Please come out! I never hurt priests, even if they've done wrong things." The priest said, "My wife must come out too!"  Garuda let them both go.  They thanked him and flew away.

Garuda flew to see his dad, a very important sage. His dad asked, "Son, are you okay? Do you get enough to eat?"

Garuda said, "Dad, Mom and my brother are fine. But I'm always hungry!  Snakes told me to get them special magical juice called Amrita.  To get it, I have to be strong.  Mom told me to eat lots of Nishadas (a type of people). I ate thousands, but I'm still hungry!"

His dad said, "There's a magic lake. In it, an elephant and a tortoise fight all the time.  Long ago, they were brothers who argued about their stuff. One brother became an elephant, the other a tortoise, because of a magic curse! Eat them both to become strong enough for the Amrita!"  He also gave Garuda a blessing for strength.

Garuda flew to the lake.  He saw the HUGE elephant and tortoise fighting! He grabbed one in each claw and flew away.  He flew to a magical forest with amazing trees.  The trees were scared of Garuda's big wings!  A giant banyan tree offered him a branch to sit on.  Garuda sat down, ready to eat the elephant and tortoise to get stronger.  Then, his branch broke!  The story ends there.
