Once upon a time, Arjuna told a story.  Some young men, who were still boys really, left their homes to live in the forest. They thought this was the best way to be good.  They didn't understand much yet.

A magical bird appeared. It was actually Indra, the king of the gods, disguised!  He told the boys that eating leftover food from a special ceremony was really, really good.  It made people very holy.

The boys said, "We do that!  We eat leftovers!"

But Indra, the bird, said, "No!  You're living in dirty places and eating scraps. That's not good."

The boys were confused. "What should we do?" they asked.

Indra said, "I'll tell you, if you listen."

The boys agreed.  Indra said, "Cows are the best animals. Gold is the best metal.  And Brahmins (wise people) are the best people.  Brahmins have special prayers and ceremonies throughout their lives.  These are very important.  They lead to a good life.  Following these rules is the best kind of being good."

Indra explained that serving others and doing your duties is better than just living alone in the forest.  Taking care of your family and being kind is like a holy task.  Eating leftovers *after* you've fed your family and guests is truly good.  He said being honest and good makes you respected.

The boys listened and understood. They realized that living with their families and doing what was right was the best way to be good. They went back home.

Arjuna finished the story. He said, "This shows us that sometimes, doing your duties and being kind are more important than living alone."
