Once upon a time, a brave prince named Arjuna wanted powerful weapons.  King Yudhishthira told him to go get them.

Arjuna, strong and brave, journeyed to a faraway, scary forest.  This forest was full of big trees, strange animals, and even magical beings!  Arjuna was all alone. He wanted to meet powerful gods to ask for weapons.

He was very determined.  Arjuna sat and meditated, and became very, very serious about his prayers.  He ate less and less food, until he ate only air!  The forest itself started to shake from his powerful meditation!

The gods heard about Arjuna’s amazing hard work.  The great god Shiva, with three eyes, heard what Arjuna was doing.  Some wise men told Shiva, “This prince is making the earth hot with his prayers!  He’s very serious!”

Shiva knew what Arjuna wanted.  He smiled and said, “Don’t worry about him. I know what he wants, and I will help him.”

The wise men were happy. They went home. Arjuna, with his hard work and strong spirit, got the powerful weapons he needed.  He was a very good and determined prince.
