King Dhritarashtra asked his advisor, Sanjaya, "What happened when Karna, our hope for victory, left the battlefield? How did Bhima fight? And what did Karna do after seeing Bhima?"

Sanjaya said, "Karna got into a new chariot and went back to fight Bhima!  He was super angry!  Dhritarashtra's sons thought Bhima was going to lose against the furious Karna.  Karna shot many arrows at Bhima's chariot.  A huge fight started between Karna and Bhima! They were both so angry, their eyes were red! They looked like two angry snakes! They fought like hawks or angry monsters!

Bhima remembered all the bad things the Kauravas had done.  He remembered losing his kingdom, being sent away to live in the forest, and all the mean things Karna and the Kauravas said. He remembered how they even tried to hurt his mother and Krishna. He was so angry, he didn't care if he died!

Bhima pulled his strong bow. He shot so many arrows, it looked like he blocked out the sun! Karna smiled and shot back, hitting Bhima nine times.  But Bhima kept fighting!

Karna blew his conch shell – it sounded like a hundred trumpets!  He attacked Bhima’s army of elephants, horses, chariots, and soldiers.  Bhima fought back, covering Karna with arrows. Then Karna mixed his white horses with Bhima’s black horses. It was a beautiful, but scary sight, like black and white clouds mixing in the sky!

The other soldiers were terrified watching them fight. It was like watching a scary show in the land of the dead!  Neither Karna nor Bhima could win! They just kept shooting arrows at each other! Their arrows flew like rain.  The sky sparkled with golden arrows, like shooting stars! It looked amazing, but many soldiers, horses, and elephants died.  The battlefield was covered with dead bodies. It was a terrible, bloody battle!"
