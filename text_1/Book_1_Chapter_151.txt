Once upon a time, the Pandava brothers and their mom were hiding in the forest.  They were very sad and worried.  A bad man named Duryodhana wanted to hurt them.

A wise man named Vidura knew about Duryodhanaâ€™s plan. He sent a trusted friend to help the Pandavas.  This friend found the Pandavas measuring the depth of a river.

The friend had a special surprise! He showed them a super-fast boat! It was strong and could sail through any storm.  He gave them a secret message from Vidura.  The message was a riddle:  "The thing that eats grass and dries in the sun doesn't burn the creatures hiding in a forest hole.  If you understand this, you'll be safe!"

This proved that the friend was really from Vidura.  Vidura also told the Pandavas they would win against Duryodhana and his friends in a big battle.

The friend helped the Pandavas and their mom get into the boat. He said Vidura wanted them to be careful on their journey.  He even pretended to hug them and smell their heads, just like Vidura would!

The boat sailed across the river.  Once they were safe, the friend shouted "Victory!" He then went back to Vidura.

The Pandavas sent a message back to Vidura and continued their journey secretly and quickly. They were on their way to a new, safe home!
