Once upon a time, high in the mountains, Arjuna, a brave warrior, was praying very hard.  Suddenly, Shiva, the powerful god, appeared!  He vanished as quickly as the sun setting. Arjuna was amazed! "Wow," he thought, "I saw the great god! I'm so lucky!" He felt strong and ready for anything.

Then, Varuna, the water god, arrived with all his ocean friendsâ€”fish, whales, and even rivers!  He shone brightly, like a giant jewel.  Next came Kuvera, the treasure god, riding in a sparkling chariot with his helpers. He looked like he was made of gold!

Then Yama, the god of death, came with his helpers. He was very powerful, but also kind.  After that, Indra, the king of the gods, arrived on his elephant, Airavata. He was surrounded by many other gods, looking like the moon in the clouds.

All the gods spoke to Arjuna.  Yama, with a voice like thunder, said, "Arjuna, you are a very special person. In your past life, you were a great saint.  We are here to help you fight a big battle. You will defeat many powerful enemies, even Bhishma, a very strong warrior!"

Varuna, the water god, gave Arjuna powerful weapons that could trap anyone.  Kuvera, the treasure god, gave him a special weapon that could make his enemies sleepy. Indra, the king of the gods, promised to take Arjuna to heaven in his chariot!

Arjuna thanked all the gods.  He bowed down and offered them gifts. The gods smiled and went back to their homes.  Arjuna felt happy and powerful, ready to fight any battle! He had everything he needed to win!
