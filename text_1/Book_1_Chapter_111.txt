Once upon a time, in a land far away, lived a princess named Kunti.  She was very beautiful and kind.  Her uncle, Kuntibhoja, couldn't have children, so Kunti went to live with him.  She was very good at taking care of guests.

One day, a very powerful holy man named Durvasa came to visit. Kunti was so kind to him that he gave her a magical spell.  This spell could summon gods from the sky!  Curious, Kunti tried it out. She called upon the Sun God, Surya.

Surya appeared, shining brightly!  Kunti was scared, she just wanted to see if the spell worked.  Surya explained that the spell was real, and that their meeting would have a result.  Kunti was shy and worried about what her family would think, but Surya was very kind and understanding.  They had a son together.

This son was very special! He was born with magical armor and earrings.  Kunti was afraid of what people would say, so she put her baby in a basket and put him in the river.

A kind couple, Radha and her husband, found the baby. They loved him and named him Karna. Karna grew up strong and generous. He was always giving to the poor.

One day, the powerful god Indra, who wanted to help his son, tricked Karna into giving him his magical armor.  In return, Indra gave Karna a powerful spear. From then on, Karna was known as Karna, the one who gave away his armor.  He became a very brave warrior.
