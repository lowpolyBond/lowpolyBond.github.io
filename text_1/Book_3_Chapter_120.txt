Satyaki, a brave warrior, spoke to Krishna.  "Krishna," he said, "we shouldn't just cry!  Yudhishthira is quiet, but we need to fight!  Kings have helpers.  Yayati had Saivya and others to help him.  The Pandavas have amazing helpers: you, me, Pradyumna, and Samva! We are strong enough to save the whole world! Why are the Pandavas still hiding in the forest? Let's attack today!  Let's defeat Duryodhana and his army! You, Krishna, are the strongest! You can defeat anyone!  Arjuna is my brother, friend, and teacher – like a second self to Krishna.  This is the perfect time to fight! I'll defeat Duryodhana! I'll cut off his head!  I'll defeat all of Duryodhana's army! Pradyumna will defeat Kripa and Drona.  Samva will defeat Dussasana!  Samva is super strong!  He's even defeated a demon army! Krishna, you will burn their army with your arrows!  Let Aniruddha fight too!  Let all our warriors fight! Let’s defeat Duryodhana’s army and make Abhimanyu king until Yudhishthira finishes his promise. Then Yudhishthira will rule the world!"

Krishna answered, "Satyaki, you're right. But Yudhishthira wants to win by his own strength. He's honest and brave.  Bhima and Arjuna are very strong too.  And the twins and Draupadi are with him.  With all of us together, Yudhishthira will surely win!"

Yudhishthira spoke next. "Satyaki, Krishna, you are brave, but I believe honesty is most important.  Only Krishna truly understands me, and I understand him.  When the time is right, Krishna will defeat Duryodhana. But today, let's let the warriors return home. They are our friends and they have been kind to us.  Remember to always be good.  I will see you again soon."

The warriors said goodbye. The Yadavas went home. The Pandavas went to a holy river.  Many important people greeted Yudhishthira there, happy to see him safe.
