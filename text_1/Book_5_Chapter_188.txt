Once upon a time, during a big battle, Bhishma, a strong warrior, aimed a powerful weapon at Rama, a wise holy man.  Suddenly, a loud noise boomed from the sky!  The gods shouted, "Don't use that weapon!"

Even though the gods warned him, Bhishma almost fired it.  Then, Narada, a wise messenger of the gods, appeared. He said, "Bhishma, stop! Rama is your teacher, and the gods are asking you to spare him!"

Bhishma looked up and saw eight shining gods in the sky. They smiled and said, "Listen to Narada. It's best for everyone."  So, Bhishma put away his weapon.

Rama was very angry when he saw Bhishma had stopped.  He shouted, "I'm defeated!"  Then, Rama's ancestors appeared. They said, "Rama, don't fight Bhishma!  Fighting is for warriors, not holy men.  Studying and praying are better for you. This should be your last battle! Put down your weapon and be peaceful."

The ancestors also explained that the gods didn't want Bhishma to fight Rama.  They said Arjuna, a great warrior, was destined to defeat Bhishma, not Rama.

Rama said, "I can't stop fighting! I made a promise!"  His ancestors asked Bhishma to stop instead.  Bhishma said, "I promised I'd never run away from a battle! It's my duty to fight!"

Then, the gods, Narada, and Bhishma's mother came to the battlefield. They pleaded with both Rama and Bhishma to stop. The gods said, "Holy men are gentle. Bhishma, you can't be defeated by Rama, and Rama can't be defeated by you!"

Finally, Rama put down his weapons.  Seeing this, Bhishma, even though he was hurt, went to Rama and bowed down. Rama smiled and said, "Bhishma, you're the best warrior!  You made me very happy today."  Then Rama talked to a princess from Kasi.
