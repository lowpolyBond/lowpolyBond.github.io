King Dhritarashtra was worried.  His wise advisors, Vidura, Bhishma, and Drona, had all told him that his son Duryodhana was causing big problems.  Dhritarashtra asked a wise man, Vyasa, for help.

Vyasa said, "A holy man, Maitreya, is coming. He will talk to Duryodhana.  He must listen! If he doesn't, Maitreya will be very angry and put a curse on him!"

Soon, Maitreya arrived.  King Dhritarashtra welcomed him. He asked about the Pandava brothers, Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva.  He worried about them and wondered if his sons were being kind to them.

Maitreya had seen the Pandavas living simply in the forest. He learned about the terrible things Duryodhana had done to them, using a game of dice to cheat them out of their kingdom. He told Dhritarashtra, "Your sons are acting very badly! You are the king, you must make them stop fighting with the Pandavas!  It's not right!"

Maitreya then spoke to Duryodhana.  He said, "Duryodhana, be kind to the Pandavas! They are strong warriors. Remember how Bhima killed the scary monster Kirmira and the powerful Jarasandha?  Make peace!"

But Duryodhana just shrugged and didn't listen. He didn't say a word. Maitreya was very angry.  He said, "Because you didn't listen, Bhima will hurt you badly in a big war!"

King Dhritarashtra tried to stop the curse, but Maitreya said, "Only if Duryodhana makes peace with the Pandavas will the curse not happen."

King Dhritarashtra wanted to know more about how strong Bhima was, so he asked Maitreya to tell him about Bhima killing Kirmira.  But Maitreya was too angry. He said, "Vidura will tell you later," and left.  Duryodhana was also upset and went away.
