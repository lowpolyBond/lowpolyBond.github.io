Arjuna, riding his chariot pulled by white horses, arrived on the battlefield! He was like a storm on the ocean, making the enemy army shake.  

While Arjuna was busy elsewhere, Duryodhana, angry and with half his army, attacked Yudhishthira.  He shot 77 arrows at Yudhishthira!  Yudhishthira, angry, shot 30 arrows back at Duryodhana!

The Kaurava army tried to capture Yudhishthira.  But Nakula, Sahadeva, and Dhrishtadyumna, with lots of soldiers, rushed to save him! Bhima also fought his way to help.

But Karna, a powerful warrior, stopped them all! He shot so many arrows that they couldn't even get close to him!

Sahadeva, using a special weapon, shot 20 arrows at Duryodhana. Duryodhana was hurt, but he looked strong like a big elephant.

Seeing this, Karna became very angry!  He attacked Yudhishthira's soldiers, and they ran away.  Karna shot so many arrows, the sky looked like it was on fire!

Karna shot many arrows at Yudhishthira, hurting him badly.  Yudhishthira, angry, shot 50 arrows at Karna!

The battle was scary and loud!  Yudhishthira fought bravely, and his arrows made the Kaurava army run.  Karna fought back fiercely, shooting many arrows at Yudhishthira.

Karna, smiling, shot three arrows at Yudhishthira's chest. Yudhishthira was hurt and told his driver to go back.

The Kauravas cheered, "Get him!" and chased Yudhishthira. But the Kekaya and Pancala soldiers stopped them.

Finally, Bhima and Duryodhana, two very strong warriors, faced each other! The battle raged on!
