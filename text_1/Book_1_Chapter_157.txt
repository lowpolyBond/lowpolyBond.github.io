Once upon a time, the Pandava brothers were traveling through a forest.  A scary giantess, Hidimva, followed them.  Bhima, the strongest brother, wanted to fight her, but his brother Yudhishthira stopped him.  "Bhima," he said, "don't fight a woman! It's wrong."

Hidimva bowed to Yudhishthira and his mother, Kunti.  She explained, "I love Bhima! I want to be his wife."  She said she would take good care of him and even help the brothers if they were ever in danger.  She promised to bring him back every night.

Yudhishthira agreed. He said Bhima could spend the day with Hidimva, but had to come back at night.  Bhima said okay.

Hidimva, happy and excited, took Bhima away.  They had amazing adventures!  They flew through the sky, played in beautiful forests, and swam in sparkling lakes.  Soon, Hidimva had a baby boy!

This baby was very special. He was strong and powerful, even though he was born with a bald head!  Hidimva and Bhima named him Ghatotkacha because his head was round like a pot.  He grew up super fast and became a great warrior.

After some time, Hidimva and Ghatotkacha said goodbye to the Pandavas.  Ghatotkacha promised to help his father and the Pandavas whenever they needed him.  He became a close friend to the Pandavas and a powerful warrior in their army.
