Once upon a time, six amazing women lived with seven wise men.  These women were very good, but their husbands sent them away.  A rumor spread that these women were the mothers of a powerful warrior named Skanda.  Because of this rumor, the women were sad and alone.

They went to see Skanda.  "We were sent away," they said, "and people say we are your mothers. Please, be our son!"

Skanda was kind. "Of course," he said. "You are my mothers now."

The king of the gods, Indra, needed Skanda's help.  He explained that a star in the sky was missing.  Indra asked Skanda to talk to the great god Brahma. Brahma helped Skanda become a bright new star in the sky!

One of the women, Vinata, wanted to always be with Skanda.  "Let me be your mother!" she said. Skanda happily agreed.

The other women asked Skanda for a big favor.  "We want to be the mothers of everyone," they said, "more important than the other goddesses!"

Skanda said he couldn't take away the other goddesses' place, but he could give them more children.  They asked for children who would be a little bit scary!

Skanda agreed, but said, "This isn't easy!"  Powerful, sometimes scary, spirits came from Skanda.  These spirits sometimes made children sick. They were called things like Skandapasmara, Putana, and Raivata.

These spirits are a little bit naughty, explained Skanda, but only until children turn sixteen.  After that, they help people.  People can keep the spirits happy by being good and worshiping Skanda.

There were other spirits too. Some made people see things that weren't there or smell wonderful things that weren't real.  Some spirits were playful, some were grumpy, and some were mischievous. These spirits stayed with people until they were very old, except for one called "fever".

But, said Markandeya, people who were good and kind didn't have to worry about these spirits! They were safe.  The end.
