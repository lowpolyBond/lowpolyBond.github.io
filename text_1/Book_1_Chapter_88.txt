King Yayati was a great king.  After he finished his job as king, he went to live in the forest.  The great god Indra asked him, "King Yayati, you're very good at being quiet and thinking deeply.  Who is as good as you?"

Yayati boasted, "No one! Not even the gods or wise people!"

Indra said, "Yayati, you're too proud! You don't respect others. Because of that, you have to leave heaven!"

Yayati said, "Please, let me fall to a place with good people."

Indra said, "You will land among kind and wise people.  But remember to be nicer to others!"  And down to Earth fell King Yayati!

A very kind and wise man, Ashtaka, saw Yayati falling.  He looked like a shining god!  Ashtaka asked, "Who are you? You're so bright and beautiful, why are you falling?"

Yayati was scared. Ashtaka said, "Don't worry! We are kind and good people.  Even the great god Indra can't hurt you here." Ashtaka welcomed Yayati, explaining that kind and wise people always help each other.  Yayati felt safe and relieved among the kind people. He learned a valuable lesson that day about being humble.
