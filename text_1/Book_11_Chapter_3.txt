King Dhritarashtra was very sad.  He felt terrible.  His wise uncle, Vidura, said, "Don't worry, my King!"

Vidura explained, "Happiness and sadness don't last forever.  Think of the world like a banana tree. It's strong for a little while, but then it falls down.  Everyone, rich or poor, will die someday.  When we're all dead, nobody will care about how pretty or important we were."

He continued, "Our bodies are like old houses. They get old and fall apart. But there's something inside us that lives forever.  It's like changing clothes â€“ we leave one body and get a new one. Good things and bad things happen because of what we do.  It's like making pots. Some pots break while the potter is making them, some break later. Some people die as babies, some as children, some when they're grown up, some when they're old.  It all depends on what happened in their past lives."

Vidura said, "Life is like swimming. Sometimes you're on top, sometimes you're underwater.  Wise people understand this.  They are kind and try to do good things.  They don't worry so much, because they know the truth about life and death."

"So," Vidura finished, "don't be so sad, my King. Everything changes. Be wise, be kind, and don't worry too much!"
