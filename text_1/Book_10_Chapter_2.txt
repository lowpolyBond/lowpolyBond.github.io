Kripa, a wise man, spoke to his friends.  "Listen," he said, "two things decide if we succeed: luck and hard work!  Neither one works alone.  We need both!"

He explained it like this:  Imagine clouds raining on a mountain.  Nothing much grows.  But rain on a field?  Lots of food grows!  Hard work without luck is like the mountain. Luck without hard work is like a field that never gets planted. We need both to grow!

Kripa said, "Sometimes, luck helps us even without trying. But smart people still work hard!  Luck and hard work together make dreams come true.  People who work hard *usually* succeed, but even they need some luck."

He told them that lazy people don't like to work, but that's not smart.  Working hard is important.  Doing nothing brings sadness.  Even people who try hard might not always succeed, and some people get lucky without trying at all. But those lucky people are often laughed at! Working hard is always best.

Kripa said that Duryodhana, a very bad king, didn't listen to good advice. He was greedy and didn't think things through.  He fought a war even though everyone told him not to!  Now he is very sad, and so are we because we followed him.

Kripa said, "We need help!  Let's ask Dhritarashtra, Gandhari, and Vidura for advice. They are wise, and they'll help us know what to do next.  We should listen to their advice."

He ended by saying that sometimes, even with hard work, things don't go our way because of bad luck. But always try our best!
