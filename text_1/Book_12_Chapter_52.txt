Krishna, a very powerful and wise man, talked to Bhishma, a great warrior who was badly hurt.  Bhishma was so happy to hear Krishna speak.  But Bhishma was very weak from his injuries. He said, "Krishna, you are so amazing! I can't possibly talk about important things when you, the wisest person, are here!  Iâ€™m too hurt, I can hardly speak!"

Krishna understood.  He said, "Bhishma, your words are wise, and you are a brave and patient warrior. Don't worry about your pain."  Krishna magically healed Bhishma! He made him feel better, and his mind became clear.  He could now see everything clearly, even far away things.

Then, many wise people came and praised Krishna.  The sky rained flowers, beautiful music played, and a gentle breeze blew. It was a wonderful, peaceful moment.  The sun set, and everyone bowed to Krishna, Bhishma, and the Pandavas (five brothers). The wise people went home, promising to come back.

Krishna and the Pandavas said goodbye to Bhishma. They rode in beautiful chariots, with elephants and soldiers following. Their army was huge and strong, like two rivers flowing together.  The moon rose, making the plants and trees fresh again after a hot day.  Finally, they all went back to their homes, tired but happy, like lions going back to their caves after a long journey.
