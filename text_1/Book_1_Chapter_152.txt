Once upon a time, the Pandava brothers – Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva – lived with their mother, Kunti.  A bad man named Duryodhana wanted them gone.  He tricked them into sleeping in a house made of wax!

When everyone was asleep, Duryodhana's friend set the house on fire.  In the morning, the townspeople rushed to see the damage.  The house was ashes!  Everyone thought the Pandavas were dead.  They cried, "Duryodhana did this! He killed the Pandavas!"  They even thought the king, Dhritarashtra, knew about it.

But, secretly, a kind man named Vidura had helped the Pandavas escape!  He’d made a secret tunnel.  The townspeople found a woman and her children who were sadly killed in the fire, but they didn't see the Pandavas.  They told Dhritarashtra, the king, that the Pandavas were dead.  Dhritarashtra was very sad. He cried a lot and ordered a big funeral.

Meanwhile, the Pandavas, along with Kunti, were safe.  They had escaped through the secret tunnel.  They were tired and scared, walking through the dark night.  Bhima, the strongest brother, carried his mom and brothers.  They walked and walked until they finally reached a dark, scary forest. Bhima, strong as a lion, carried them all, so his brothers could rest.  They were exhausted but safe, thanks to Vidura's clever plan.
