Gandhari, the mother of the Kaurava princes, was very sad.  She showed Krishna, a friend of the Pandavas, her sons who had died in a big battle.

"Look, Krishna," she cried.  "My son Vikarna is lying here.  He was so brave and strong, but Bhima killed him.  Vultures are picking at him, and his poor wife is trying to scare them away."

Next to Vikarna lay Durmukha, another of her sons.  "Even though beasts ate part of his face," Gandhari said, "he still looks handsome.  He fought bravely, but Bhimasena killed him too."

Then she showed Krishna her son Citrasena.  "He was the best archer," Gandhari sobbed.  "Now, sad women and hungry animals are all around him."

Gandhari pointed to another son, Vivinsati.  "He was so young and handsome, always surrounded by beautiful ladies.  Now, vultures are around him instead."

Finally, she showed Krishna Duhsaha.  "My brave Duhsaha!  He was unstoppable, but heâ€™s covered in arrows. Even dead, he looks magnificent, like a shining mountain."

Gandhari was heartbroken. All her sons, so strong and beautiful, were dead.  She couldn't believe such brave warriors were defeated and lay dead on the ground.  The battlefield was filled with the sad cries of women and the sounds of hungry animals. It was a terrible sight.
