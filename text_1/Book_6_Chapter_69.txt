Once upon a time, after a long night, the sun came up. Two big armies, the Pandavas and the Kauravas, got ready to fight! They were angry and wanted to win.  The Kauravas made a line that looked like a sea monster (a Makara)!  Bhishma, a great warrior, was in charge.

The Pandavas made their own line, shaped like a bird of prey (a Syena).  Strong Bhima was at its beak!  Brave Sikhandi and Dhrishtadyumna were its eyes.  Arjuna, with his amazing bow, Gandiva, was in its neck.  Many other brave heroes were in other parts of the line.

The battle began! Bhima stormed into the Kaurava line, shooting arrows at Bhishma.  Bhishma fought back bravely, but Arjuna, the best archer, shot many arrows, too!

Duryodhana, the Kaurava king, saw his army getting hurt. He asked his teacher, Drona, for help. Drona, a very strong warrior, attacked the Pandavas. Satyaki, a Pandava hero, fought bravely against Drona.  Bhima also fought Drona to protect Satyaki. Then Bhishma, Drona, and Salya all shot arrows at Bhima! But Abhimanyu and the sons of Draupadi fought back!

Sikhandin, another great warrior, fought Bhishma and Drona. Bhishma was careful because Sikhandin had a secret:  he used to be a woman.  Then Drona, trying to help Bhishma, fought Sikhandin.

The battle was huge and scary!  It was like the battle between the gods and demons a long, long time ago.  Everyone was fighting very hard to win!
