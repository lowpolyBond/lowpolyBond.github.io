King Yudhishthira woke up and greeted Krishna, a powerful warrior.  He asked Krishna if he had slept well.  Krishna asked Yudhishthira the same.

Then, a soldier told Yudhishthira that other brave warriors were waiting.  The king told the soldier to bring them in.

Many strong warriors came! There was Bhimasena, the giant; Dhrishtadyumna, the brave general; Satyaki, the skilled fighter; and many more, like Virata, Drupada, and the twins, Nakula and Sahadeva.  Even Draupadi's five sons were there!  All these heroes sat down. Krishna and another warrior sat together.

Yudhishthira spoke to Krishna.  He said, "We're in trouble, Krishna.  We lost our kingdom! We need you to help us win the war and bring us happiness. We trust you completely."

Yudhishthira worried about his brother, Arjuna.  "Krishna," he said, "please help Arjuna keep his promise. Please save us like a boat saves people from a stormy sea!"

Krishna said, "Don't worry! Arjuna is the best warrior in the whole world!  He's strong, brave, and very skilled with his bow and arrow.  I will help Arjuna defeat all your enemies. Today, he will defeat Jayadratha, a very bad man.  Even the gods couldn't save Jayadratha from Arjuna's arrows!  Arjuna will win, and you will be safe."  Krishna promised Yudhishthira that everything would be alright.  He told him to not worry and be happy.
