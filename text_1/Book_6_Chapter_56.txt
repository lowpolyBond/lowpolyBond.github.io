The sun came up.  Bhishma, a great warrior, told the Kaurava army to get ready for battle. He made their army look like a giant eagle!  Bhishma was the eagle's head.  Two strong warriors,  Drona and Kritavarman, were its eyes.  Other brave fighters like Ashwatthama and Kripa were in its head, too.  Many more soldiers from different kingdoms made up the eagleâ€™s body and wings.  Duryodhana, the Kaurava prince, was in the eagle's middle.

Meanwhile, Arjuna, a super strong Pandava warrior, looked at the Kaurava army.  He and Dhrishtadyumna made the Pandava army look like a giant half-moon!  Bhima, the strongest Pandava, was on one side.  Virata and Drupada were next to him, then Nila and Dhrishtaketu.  Dhrishtadyumna and Shikhandi were in the middle with Yudhishthira and his elephants.  Satyaki and Draupadi's five sons fought near Yudhishthira.  Arjuna, protected by Krishna, was on the other side of the half-moon.

Then, the battle began!  The armies crashed together.  Elephants and chariots smashed into each other.  The noise was huge!  Drums beat, and soldiers shouted as they fought. The sounds went all the way up to the sky!
