Once upon a time, during a great war, Karna, a mighty warrior, got ready for battle.  He roared like a lion, his chariot rattled, and the ground shook with the noise! He was furious and ready to fight the Pandava army. He arranged his soldiers to fight back against the Pandavas, led by Dhristadyumna.  Karna fought bravely, defeating many Pandava soldiers. He even shot many arrows at Yudhishthira, the oldest Pandava brother, and pushed him to the side.

King Dhritarashtra, Karna's uncle, asked his advisor, Sanjaya, about the battle. He wanted to know how Karna’s army was organized and where everyone was standing.  He wondered who would dare to fight against Arjuna, the greatest warrior of the Pandavas, who was so strong he had once defeated all the creatures in a magical forest!

Sanjaya described the armies.  On Karna's side, Kripa and Kritavarma were on the right, along with many soldiers from Gandhara.  On the left, there were even more soldiers, ready to fight Krishna and Arjuna.  Karna himself was in the center, shining brightly in his armor.  Behind him were Duryodhana and his brothers.

The Pandavas also had their army organized.  Yudhishthira told Arjuna, “Look at Karna’s huge army! We must fight them well!” Arjuna promised to protect them. He planned how they would attack. Yudhishthira said:  "Arjuna will fight Karna, Bhima will fight Duryodhana, and the other Pandavas will fight other Kaurava warriors!"

Arjuna and Krishna, his friend and charioteer, rode into battle in a magnificent chariot. Shalya, Karna's charioteer, warned Karna that Arjuna was coming and that the battle signs were bad—the wind was strong, animals were scared, and even the sun seemed to be hidden!  Shalya said if Karna could defeat Arjuna, he would be king.

Karna, though scared, bravely faced Arjuna.  Shalya continued to warn Karna that Arjuna was impossible to defeat, pointing out the strength of Bhima and the other Pandava warriors.

Finally, the two massive armies crashed into each other! It was a terrible and exciting battle, like two giant rivers meeting!
