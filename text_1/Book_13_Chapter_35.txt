King Yudhisthira, a very good king, asked Bhishma a question.  Bhishma was a wise old man.

Bhishma said, "Kings and everyone should respect Brahmins.  Brahmins are holy people. They are like special guests, and they get the first food at every meal.

Brahmins bring good things: happiness, wealth, and even a peaceful afterlife. They are friends to everyone. When Brahmins pray, good things happen.  But if someone is mean to a Brahmin, the Brahmin can wish bad things to happen to that person.

A long, long time ago, the Creator, God himself, made Brahmins and gave them important jobs.  Brahmins should always do what’s right. They should be kind and protect others.  If they do this, good things will happen to them.

Brahmins should study holy books.  Learning makes them strong and clever. They get magic-like powers!  They offer special food to the gods, making everyone happy.  They’re so important, they even get to eat first!

Brahmins are kind and follow rules. If they do this, all their wishes come true!  They can get anything they want through prayers and good deeds. This is what the Creator, God, told everyone a long, long time ago.

Brahmins are very powerful! Some are as strong as lions or tigers! Some have powers like snakes or sharks! Some can even hurt people with just their words or a look! But some are very kind.  Brahmins are all different.

Even powerful kings and armies couldn't defeat Brahmins. If you're a king and want to rule your land, you must be nice to Brahmins.  They are very important, even to the gods! Always be kind to them, and give them gifts.  If you're good to Brahmins, you'll be a successful king!"
