After the big battle, everyone was sad.  King Yudhishthira, who was very fair, heard that his uncle, Dhritarashtra, was coming.  Dhritarashtra was very upset because all his sons had died.

Yudhishthira, his brothers, and their friend Krishna went to see him.  Draupadi, Yudhishthira's wife, was also very sad and went with them.  Near the river, they saw many women crying.  The women were angry. They shouted, "You killed our fathers, brothers, and sons! How can you be so calm?"

Yudhishthira felt terrible. He bowed down to his uncle.  Dhritarashtra was so angry about his sons' deaths that he wanted to hurt Bhima, one of Yudhishthira's brothers.  He was so angry, it was like a big fire!

Krishna was very clever.  He secretly replaced Bhima with an iron statue that looked exactly like him!  Dhritarashtra hugged the statue and squeezed it so hard that he broke it into pieces! He hurt himself badly and fell down.

Sanjaya, Dhritarashtra's driver, helped him.  Dhritarashtra cried, "Oh, Bhima! Oh, Bhima!"  He was very sorry.

Krishna then told him, "Don't worry! You didn't hurt Bhima.  That was just an iron statue. I saved Bhima. You are very strong, but your sadness made you angry.  Bringing Bhima back to life won't bring your sons back."

Dhritarashtra was relieved. He understood and stopped being angry. He knew he needed to let go of his sadness.
