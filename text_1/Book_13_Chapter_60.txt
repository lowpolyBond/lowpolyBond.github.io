Once upon a time, Yudhishthira, a very good king, asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, a question.  "Grandpa," he said, "if I want to give a gift, which is better?  Giving to a wise man who asks for help, or giving to a wise man who doesn't ask?"

Bhishma smiled.  "My dear Yudhishthira," he said, "giving to someone who doesn't ask is much better!  It's like giving a gift to someone who is happy with what they have.  A wise man who doesn't ask is strong and peaceful.  It's like a brave warrior protecting people, but for a wise man, his strength is in not needing to ask for anything."

Bhishma explained that begging is embarrassing.  People who beg are like thieves, bothering everyone.  The person who gives the gift is the truly strong one. They save the person in need and also make themselves happier.  Bhishma said it’s kind to help anyone who asks, but it’s even better to find those who are quiet and in need. He told Yudhishthira to look for the very wise men who hide their poverty. These men, even though they don't ask for help, are like powerful, hidden fires that can change the world. They are amazing people worthy of great respect.  

Bhishma said Yudhishthira should find these quiet, wise men and give them lots of wonderful things – homes, clothes, food, and everything they need.   He should also give to those who *do* ask, out of kindness.  He even said it's important to give to the people who are with his wise guests, so when they return home, their families will have plenty to eat.

Giving gifts is a special kind of prayer, Bhishma said.  It’s like giving food to the gods and helping your ancestors.  The best way to give gifts is to be kind, to be generous and happy.  Giving gifts should be done with a big heart, not just for the sake of giving.  The real gift is in the kindness and generosity.  Then you'll be a truly great king, and make everyone happy!
