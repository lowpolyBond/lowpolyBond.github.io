Once upon a time, Brahma, the creator god, got very angry. He made so many creatures – animals, plants, everything! But the Earth was getting too crowded.  It was heavy with all the living things.

Sthanu, another god, saw Brahma's anger.  He felt sad because Brahma's anger was like a giant fire, burning up everything! "Please be kind," Sthanu begged Brahma.

Brahma explained, "I didn't want to destroy everything! The Earth begged me to help her because she was so full. I got angry because I didn't know how to fix it!"

Rudra, another god, also asked Brahma to stop.  "Please don't destroy the world!" he pleaded.  "The fire from your anger is burning everything, the plants, animals and even the rocks!"

Brahma listened. He calmed down and put out the fire. But from his anger, a scary-looking woman appeared! She was dark and red and had red eyes.  She was Death!

Brahma told Death, "You were born from my anger. Now, kill all these creatures."

But Death felt really sad. She cried. Brahma caught her tears. He felt sorry for what he'd done.  He decided not to destroy the world.

He used Death's tears to help the creatures and gave them a chance to live. From then on, Death wouldn’t destroy everything, but would only take creatures when their time came to go.
