Once upon a time, in a great battle between monkeys and demons, a strong demon named Prahasta attacked Vibhishana, a wise monkey.  Prahasta hit Vibhishana hard with his club, but Vibhishana stood strong and steady like a mountain!  Then Vibhishana threw a powerful spear, and *whoosh*!  Prahasta's head flew off.

Another demon, Dhumraksha, saw his friend fall. He charged at the monkeys.  The monkeys got scared and ran.  But then, Hanuman, the strongest monkey, stepped forward.  Seeing Hanuman, the other monkeys bravely came back to fight.

The battle was fierce!  It was a big mess of blood and flying arrows. Dhumraksha shot many arrows, but Hanuman grabbed him!  They fought like two super-strong heroes. Hanuman used tree branches to fight, and Dhumraksha used his clubs.  Hanuman won, defeating Dhumraksha and his chariot.

The monkeys were so happy! They fought bravely and chased the scared demons back to Lanka, their city.

The demons ran to King Ravana and told him the bad news: Prahasta and Dhumraksha were dead!  Ravana sighed sadly.  He needed help! He had to wake up his giant brother, Kumbhakarna, who was sleeping very soundly.  Ravana used loud instruments to wake his brother.

When Kumbhakarna woke up, Ravana told him, "Brother, Rama and his monkey army came across the ocean to fight us! They've already killed many of our friends.  Only you can defeat Rama! Please, go fight!"

Kumbhakarna agreed to help, and two other strong demons joined him. They marched out of Lanka, ready for battle!
