One day, Bhishma and Rama fought a big battle.  Rama was very strong and used magical weapons! He threw amazing weapons that flew like shooting stars.  They were so bright!

Bhishma was super brave. He used his own special weapons to stop Rama's.  He was really good at it!

Then Rama threw a giant, flaming spear – it looked like the end of the world! Bhishma cleverly broke it into three pieces with his arrows.  Rama got angry and threw lots more spears – so many, they looked like a dozen suns!

Bhishma fought back with his own arrows. It was like a giant arrow fight!  He stopped Rama's spears with a rain of his own arrows.  

Rama kept throwing more powerful weapons. They had gold and looked like fiery snakes! Bhishma protected himself with his shield and sword. Then he shot arrows at Rama's horses and driver!

Rama, still angry, used even more magical weapons. So many arrows flew that they covered Bhishma, his horses, his driver, and his chariot!  His chariot even broke!

Bhishma also shot many arrows at Rama. Both warriors were hurt. They were both covered in arrows.  Finally, when the sun went down, the great battle ended. They were both tired but very, very brave!
