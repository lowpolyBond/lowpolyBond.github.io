Long ago, in the land of Bharat, a wise old warrior named Bhishma told a king a very important story.  Bhishma said, "Always be kind to the Brahmins! They are like special teachers and wise people.  They bring happiness or sadness to the kingdom.  Treat them like your grandparents, give them nice things, and show them respect. If you do, your kingdom will be happy and peaceful, just like the whole world is peaceful when the gods are happy!"

Bhishma explained that even great warriors needed the Brahmins.  He told the king a story that Narada, a very wise man, had told him. Narada said inviting a good Brahmin to live in your home is the best thing you can do!  It brings all kinds of good luck.  When Brahmins get offerings, the gods get them too.  Brahmins are like the parents of everyone.  They are super important!

Bhishma said, "The sun, moon, wind, water, earth, sky—everything goes into the Brahmin’s body when they eat. If a Brahmin doesn't eat in your house, the spirits of your ancestors won't either.  And the gods won’t either if you’re unkind to Brahmins. Happy Brahmins mean happy ancestors and happy gods!"

Bhishma said even strong warriors, who could win any battle, couldn’t win against kind Brahmins.  He told stories of brave Brahmins defeating powerful warriors just by being good and wise.

Bhishma told another story.  Lord Krishna, a very powerful god, asked Mother Earth, "How can I get rid of all my bad deeds?"  Mother Earth said, "Serve the Brahmins!  It will bring you good luck, make you smart, and even make you a better warrior!"

She even said that even the great god Indra, who was once covered in bad marks, got rid of them by being good to the Brahmins.

Bhishma finished, "So, you must always respect the Brahmins!  Krishna himself listened to Mother Earth and was very happy to do so. You, too, should always be kind and respectful to Brahmins, and then good things will happen to you!"
