Once upon a time, Arjuna, a brave prince, went to live with the gods in heaven! The gods were very happy to see him. They gave him a special welcome, washing his feet and face.  Arjuna lived in a beautiful palace.

The god Indra gave Arjuna amazing weapons, like a powerful thunderbolt and magical lightning bolts!  Arjuna was very strong and skillful. He spent five whole years in heaven, having a wonderful time.

But after a while, Indra, the king of the gods, told Arjuna, "Arjuna, learn to play music and dance from Chitrasena, a very talented Gandharva (a heavenly musician)."  Arjuna made friends with Chitrasena and learned beautiful heavenly music and dances that nobody on Earth knew.

Even though Arjuna had fun learning, he couldn't stop thinking about his brothers and his mother, Kunti.  He missed them very much!  He remembered how unfairly they had been treated, and he was angry at the people who hurt them.  He learned wonderful things in heaven, but his heart ached for his family.  He was ready to go home to help them.
