Once upon a time, in a small town, a wise old man was very sad.  Queen Kunti saw him and asked, "Why are you so unhappy? Can I help?"

The old man sighed. "Oh, Queen," he said, "a terrible monster named Vaka lives nearby. He's a giant who eats people!  He rules our town."

"Every so often," the old man explained, "a family has to give Vaka a big cart of rice, two buffaloes, and one person as a meal!  If anyone refuses, Vaka kills their whole family.  Our king is not very smart, so he can't stop Vaka. It's my turn to give Vaka a human being, and I don't want to give up my family!"

The old man cried, "I have no money to buy someone to give to Vaka, and I can't give him my children or wife! I have no hope. Today, I must take my whole family to Vaka, and he will eat us all."  He was very, very sad.
