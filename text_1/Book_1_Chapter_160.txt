A long, long time ago, in a land far away, lived a wise Brahmin and his loving wife.  One day, a scary monster threatened to kill the Brahmin!

The Brahmin’s wife heard this and said, "Don't worry, dear husband! I know what to do.  We all must die someday.  It's okay to be sad, but don't be too upset.  I'll take your place. It’s a woman’s duty to protect her husband."

She explained, "I’ve given you wonderful children. You can take care of them.  But if I'm gone, who will protect our sweet girl from bad men who might want to marry her? Without you, I couldn't protect them.  It's better if I go. It's the best thing for all of us."

The Brahmin's wife loved her husband and children very much.  She was brave and kind.  She knew that if the monster killed her instead of her husband, her children would be safe.

The Brahmin hugged his wife tightly.  Both of them cried, their hearts full of sadness and love. They knew she was making a huge sacrifice, but it was the only way to save him and their children.
