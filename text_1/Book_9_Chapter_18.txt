After King Shalya died, his 1700 brave soldiers still wanted to fight!  They were super strong warriors from Madra land.  Duryodhana, riding a HUGE elephant, like a mountain, tried to stop them.  He even had a big umbrella and yak-tail fans! "Don't go!" he shouted, "Don't go!"

But the soldiers wanted to defeat Yudhishthira, the Pandava king. They ignored Duryodhana and charged into the Pandavas' army!  They shot their arrows and fought bravely.

When Arjuna heard that Shalya was dead and the Madra soldiers were attacking Yudhishthira, he zoomed to the rescue! His chariot made a loud rumbling sound as he raced to the battle, his bow Gandiva ready.  Then Arjuna, Bhima, the twins Nakula and Sahadeva, Satyaki, the five sons of Draupadi, Dhrishtadyumna, Shikhandi, and many other Pandava soldiers surrounded Yudhishthira, protecting him.

They fought like strong waves crashing in the ocean!  The Kaurava army trembled. The Madra soldiers yelled, "Where is Yudhishthira? Where are the Pandavas and their allies?"  They were searching everywhere.

The five sons of Draupadi bravely fought back, killing many Madra soldiers. Some Kaurava soldiers even got killed by their own flags, which fell on them during the battle. Duryodhana tried to stop his soldiers, but they wouldn't listen.

Shakuni, Duryodhana's uncle, was angry.  "Why are we just watching our soldiers die?" he asked.  "We agreed to fight together! We need to help them!"

Duryodhana said, "I told them to stop, but they didn't listen!"  Shakuni said, "Angry soldiers don't always obey orders.  Let's all go and help them!"

So the whole Kaurava army joined the fight! They shouted, "Attack! Fight! Kill!"  The Pandavas formed a strong battle line and fought back.  Soon, the Madra soldiers were defeated. Many were killed.  The battlefield was a mess!  Broken chariots, dead horses and soldiers lay everywhere.  Horses ran around without their riders, pulling broken chariots.

When the Madra army was destroyed, and they saw their king was dead, the rest of Duryodhana's army got scared and ran away! The Pandavas had won again!
