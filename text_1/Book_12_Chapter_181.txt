Once upon a time, a prince named Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandpa, do good deeds like giving gifts, praying, and being kind really make us happy and wise?"

Bhishma smiled.  "Yudhishthira," he said, "if we let anger and bad feelings control us, we do bad things.  Bad things mean we might have a hard life. We might be poor and hungry.  But if we are kind and good, and control our feelings, we will be happy and lucky. We might even live in a beautiful place!"

"People who aren't kind," Bhishma continued, "might end up in scary places with wild animals. But people who are kind to everyone, especially the gods and their guests, will live a wonderful life.  They’re like bright sunshine, while unkind people are like a tiny seed that never grows."

Bhishma explained, "What we do in our past lives follows us, like a shadow.  It's like a plant growing – in time, it will blossom.  Even when we’re babies, inside our mothers, our past actions affect us. Good deeds bring good things, bad deeds bring bad things, at the same time in our life that we did them!  It's like a calf finding its mother – our past actions always find us."

"If we are sorry for our mistakes, we can become good again. We can pray and be good, like cleaning a dirty cloth with water," Bhishma said. "People who spend time praying and being quiet in the forest can wash away their bad deeds and get what they want.  Once people are good, it’s hard to see the bad things they used to do – they’re as hard to find as a bird in the sky!"

"So," Bhishma concluded, "it's important to always do what's right. That's how you become wise and happy."
