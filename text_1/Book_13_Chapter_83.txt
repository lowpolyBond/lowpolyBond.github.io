Once upon a time, a wise old man named Bhishma told a story about cows.  He said cows are super important!  People who give away cows are like they're always praying.  Cows give us milk, yogurt, and butter, which are used in special prayers.  Butter is super special because it makes the prayers work best.

Bhishma said that giving a cow is the best gift you can give. Cows are very special and pure. They help us stay healthy and happy.  Milk, yogurt, and butter from cows can even wash away our bad deeds!

Bhishma told a story about a long time ago.  Lots of magical beings – gods, spirits, and even dragons – came together to see the Great God Brahma.  The king of the gods, Indra, asked Brahma, "Why are cows so special? Why are they even more important than us gods?"

Brahma smiled. He said Indra didn’t understand how important cows are because Indra didn't treat them well. Then Brahma explained: Cows are like the body of a prayer; without them, prayers can't be complete.  Cows help farmers grow food. They give milk, yogurt, and butter for prayers. They’re kind and gentle.  Because of all this, cows live in a wonderful place even better than where the gods live!

Brahma then told a story about Surabhi, a magical cow.  Surabhi was so good and kind that she prayed really hard for a very long time, standing on one leg!  She was so amazing that even the gods got really hot from her powerful prayer!  Brahma was so impressed he gave Surabhi a special gift: immortality and a beautiful place to live called Goloka, a place better than anywhere else. But he said Surabhi's children, the normal cows, would live with people on Earth.

After hearing Brahma's story, Indra started treating cows with great respect.  Bhishma told Yudhishthira that anyone who is kind to cows and tells this story will be very lucky. They will get everything they want – children, wealth, and wisdom!  Being kind to cows is like magic!
