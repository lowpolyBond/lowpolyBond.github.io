Once upon a time, in the land of Bharatavarsha, the wise king Yudhishthira wanted to know about life after death. He asked his grandfather, Bhishma, a very wise man, about what happens to people after they die.

Bhishma said, "Yudhishthira, I don't know all the answers. But Vrihaspati, a very wise teacher, does. Let's ask him!"

Vrihaspati, the wise teacher, came down from the sky. Everyone bowed to him. Yudhishthira asked, "Who is a person's real friend? Is it their father, mother, or friends?"

Vrihaspati said, "You are born alone, and you die alone.  Your family and friends may grieve for a little while, but then they go on with their lives. Only one thing truly stays with you:  Righteousnessâ€”doing what is right and good.  Righteousness is your only real friend. Be good, and you'll go to heaven. Be bad, and you'll go to hell."

Yudhishthira then asked, "What happens to the body after we die?"

Vrihaspati explained, "The body disappears, but your good and bad actions are remembered by many powerful beings:  the earth, the wind, the sun, and even the god of death, Yama. Righteousness travels with you. Your actions determine what happens to you in your next life."

Yudhishthira asked more questions. He wanted to know about how life begins, how our bodies are made, and what happens after we die. Vrihaspati explained that everything is made of elements like earth, wind, and fire. These elements and our actions shape our next life.

Vrihaspati then shared a very important lesson:  If you do bad things, you might be reborn as an animal!  For example, if you're unkind to your parents, you could become an ass or a dog. If you lie or steal, you could become a worm, a bird, or even a mouse!  But if you are good and kind and do the right thing, you will have a good life in your next birth.

Yudhishthira listened carefully. He learned that being righteous and kind is the most important thing, both in this life and the next.  He thanked Vrihaspati for his wise words, and promised to always do what is right.  And that, my friends, is a very important lesson for us all!
