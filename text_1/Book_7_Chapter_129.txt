The battle was raging!  Arjuna and Bhima, with their brave friends, had chased away many of the enemy soldiers.  They were heading towards the King of Sindhu.

Duryodhana, the prince, was worried. He raced to his teacher, Drona, in his super-fast chariot.  "Teacher!" he cried, "Arjuna and Bhima are winning!  They've beaten almost everyone! What should we do?  Everyone is saying you've been defeated!  We need to save the King of Sindhu!"

Drona thought hard. "The Pandavas are strong," he said. "But we must protect the King of Sindhu, especially from Arjuna.  It's like a game now – the King is the prize. We need to win this game. Let’s go protect him, and I’ll stop the other Pandavas."

Duryodhana and his men quickly went to protect the King.  They met two brave Panchala princes, Yudhamanyu and Uttamaujas, who were rushing to help Arjuna.  A fierce battle started!

Yudhamanyu shot many arrows at Duryodhana, but Duryodhana broke his bow and hit his chariot.  Uttamaujas also fought bravely, hitting Duryodhana's chariot.  Then Duryodhana's chariot was broken!  He jumped out, grabbed a club, and fought them on foot.  The princes, seeing Duryodhana's strength, jumped off their chariot too.  Duryodhana smashed their chariot.  He then quickly hopped onto another chariot and continued fighting.

Meanwhile, the two Panchala princes got on new chariots and went to join Arjuna. The battle continued!
