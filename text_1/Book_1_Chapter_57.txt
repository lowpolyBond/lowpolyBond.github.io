Once upon a time, in a land far away, a big snake sacrifice was happening.  A wise man, Saunaka, asked Sauti, "Tell me, how many snakes were burned in the fire?"

Sauti said, "So many! Thousands and thousands and even more!  It's impossible to count them all! But I remember some of the most important ones.  These were all from special snake families."

First, he talked about the snakes from Vasuki's family.  These snakes were blue, red, and white. They were big and scary, and very poisonous.  Because of a curse from their mother, they sadly fell into the fire. Sauti named some: Kotisa, Manasa, Purna, and many more.  He said many other strong snakes from Vasuki’s family were burned too.

Then, Sauti talked about the snakes from Takshaka's family.  He named Puchchandaka, Mandalaka, and lots more.

Next were the snakes from Airavata's family.  Sauti said Paravata, Parijata, and others were burned.

He also told about the Kauravya family snakes – Eraka, Kundala, and more.

Finally, he spoke of the Dhritarashtra family snakes. These were super-fast and super-poisonous! He named Sankukarna, Pitharaka, and many, many others.

Sauti sighed, "I’ve only named the most famous ones!  There were so many more! Some had three heads, some had seven, even ten! They were all huge and scary, with poison as hot as fire!  Thousands and thousands of snakes were burned."

Even their babies and grandchildren were burned in the fire!  They were all so big and strong.  Some were as long as a mountain!  Because of their mother’s curse, they all burned in the big fire.
