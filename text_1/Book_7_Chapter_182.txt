King Dhritarashtra was very upset. He asked Sanjaya, "Karna had a magic spear that could kill anyone! Why didn't he use it on Arjuna? If Arjuna died, the Pandavas would have lost!  Why didn't Karna challenge Arjuna to a fight?"

Sanjaya explained, "Krishna, Arjuna's friend, was very clever. He knew Karna wanted to use that special spear. So, he sent Ghatotkacha, a strong giant, to fight Karna.  Ghatotkacha was very brave! Either Karna would win and use up his special spear on Ghatotkacha, or Ghatotkacha would win and Karna wouldn't get to use it on Arjuna!"

Dhritarashtra was still angry. "My son, Duryodhana, and his friends are foolish! They should have made Karna use the spear on Arjuna! Why didn't they plan this better?"

Sanjaya said, "They *did* plan it! Every night, Duryodhana, Sakuni, Duhsasana, and I told Karna to use the spear only on Arjuna.  We said, 'If Arjuna dies, the Pandavas will be defeated!'  But Krishna was always one step ahead. He kept Arjuna safe. He made sure Karna never got the chance!"

Dhritarashtra asked, "Why didn't they use it on Krishna?  Krishna is the Pandavasâ€™ leader. Without him, they'd be lost!"

Sanjaya explained, "They tried! But Krishna was too clever. He always protected Arjuna. He even put other strong warriors in front of Karna to protect Arjuna, making Karna waste his power!  Krishna is like a mighty warrior and nobody could defeat him."

Satyaki, another warrior, also asked Krishna about this. He said, "Krishna, Karna planned to use the spear on Arjuna. Why didn't he?"

Krishna answered, "Duryodhana and his friends told Karna to only use that spear on Arjuna. Karna agreed, but I always tricked him. I kept him busy, making sure he didn't get the chance! I couldn't sleep until I stopped Karna from killing Arjuna.  Arjuna is like my own son to me; I would protect him with my life!"  Krishna had cleverly used Ghatotkacha to ensure Arjuna's safety.  Krishna loved Arjuna very much and would do anything to protect him.
