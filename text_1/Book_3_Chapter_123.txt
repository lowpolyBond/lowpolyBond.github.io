Once upon a time, two shining gods, the Aswin twins, saw a beautiful girl named Sukanya bathing in the woods.  She was so pretty, they thought she looked like a princess!

They asked her, "Pretty girl, who are you? And what are you doing here?"

Sukanya shyly said, "I'm Sarayati's daughter, and I'm married to Chyavana."

The Aswins were surprised.  "Why are you married to an old, old man?" they asked.  "You're much too beautiful for him! You're like a bright flash of lightning! We think you should marry one of us!"

Sukanya said, "No, I love my husband."

The Aswins, who were also great healers, smiled. "We can make your husband young and handsome again!" they promised. "Then you can choose who you want to be withâ€”him or one of us."

Sukanya went and told Chyavana. Chyavana said, "Okay, let's do it!"

Sukanya told the Aswins, "He agrees!"

The Aswins said, "Have him go into the water."

Chyavana went into the water with the Aswins.  When they came out, they all looked young and handsome!  They all looked exactly the same!

Sukanya looked at them and, after thinking carefully, she found her husband. She chose him!

Chyavana was so happy to be young and handsome again, and to have his beautiful wife.  He was so grateful to the Aswins, he promised to give them a special drink at a big party in heaven.

The Aswins happily flew back to heaven, and Chyavana and Sukanya lived happily ever after.
