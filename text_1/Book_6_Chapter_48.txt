King Dhritarashtra asked Sanjaya, his advisor, "Sanjaya, what happened when the great warrior Sweta went towards Salya's chariot?  What did the Kauravas and Pandavas do?  And what did Bhishma do? Tell me everything!"

Sanjaya said, "Great King, many, many brave warrior soldiers, with Sweta leading them, tried to save Sweta from Bhishma. They rushed towards Bhishma's golden chariot, ready to fight.  A huge battle began!

It was a terrible battle! Bhishma was so strong! He shot so many arrows, he almost blocked out the sun! He knocked down many chariots and killed lots of soldiers, even elephants!  It was a huge mess!  Chariots crashed into each other, horses fell, and many brave soldiers lay dead on the ground.  The battlefield was filled with dust, the sound of clashing weapons, and the screams of men. It was so loud you couldn't even hear the arrows whizzing by! Fathers couldn't even recognize their sons!  Broken chariots and dead horses lay everywhere.

Sweta fought bravely and killed many Kaurava soldiers. He shot down many chariots, horses and even flags.  But Bhishma was too strong.  He fought like a lion, all alone. He kept fighting even though many of his own soldiers ran away.

Bhishma and Sweta fought like two angry bulls, each trying to kill the other.  They shot thousands of arrows at each other! Sweta broke Bhishma’s bow, which made the Pandavas very happy and Duryodhana very sad.  

But then Bhishma got another bow and shot Sweta’s horses, his charioteer, and then almost killed him! Sweta jumped off his chariot.  Bhishma attacked him again and again. Sweta threw a powerful magical spear that looked like a deadly snake. It was so scary!  But Bhishma, without fear, used many arrows to break the spear to pieces!  The Kauravas cheered!

Sweta, still angry, picked up a huge mace and threw it at Bhishma’s chariot. He smashed the chariot to pieces. Now Bhishma was fighting on foot!  Many other warriors rushed in to help Sweta.

Then, Bhishma heard a voice from the sky that told him he would win! He got a new bow, and even though many Pandava warriors fought to protect Sweta, Bhishma shot a powerful arrow that went right through Sweta and killed him.

The Pandavas were very sad, but the Kauravas were very happy. Dussasana danced with joy!  The Pandavas, feeling defeated, left the battlefield."
