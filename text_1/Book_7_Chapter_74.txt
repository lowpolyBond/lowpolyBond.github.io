Sanjaya told the king a story.  Jayadratha, a king fighting for the Kauravas, was very scared.  The Pandavas, his enemies, were shouting happily, and Jayadratha heard them. He thought the Pandavas’ hero, Arjuna, wanted to kill him!  He was so scared, he wanted to run away.

Jayadratha went to the Kaurava leaders. He was so worried! He cried, "Arjuna wants to kill me!  I'm too scared to fight!  Even the strongest warriors can’t protect me from Arjuna!"

Duryodhana, the Kaurava king, said, "Don't worry! We’ll protect you! Many strong warriors will fight beside you.  You are a brave warrior yourself. Don't be afraid!"

Jayadratha still felt scared.  He went to Drona, the great teacher and army leader. He asked, "Drona, who’s a better fighter, me or Arjuna?"

Drona said, "You both learned the same things. But Arjuna is stronger because he practices more. But don't be afraid! I will protect you.  No one can defeat someone I protect. I'll make a strong army formation that Arjuna can't break through."  Drona also told Jayadratha that even if he died fighting bravely, he'd go to a wonderful place in heaven. Everyone dies eventually, Drona reminded him.

Duryodhana’s words and Drona's help made Jayadratha feel braver. He decided to fight! The Kaurava army cheered, happy that Jayadratha would fight with them.  The trumpets blew and the soldiers roared!
