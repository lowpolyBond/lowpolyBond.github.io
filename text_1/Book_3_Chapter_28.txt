Once upon a time, Draupadi told a story.  It was about a wise king named Prahlada and his grandson, Vali. Vali asked Prahlada, "Grandpa, is it better to be forgiving, or to be strong and powerful?"

Prahlada said, "Being strong isn't always good, and being forgiving isn't always good either!  If you're always forgiving, people won't respect you.  Your servants might be lazy and take your things.  They might even be mean to you!"

Prahlada continued, "But being always angry and powerful isn't good either! People will be afraid of you and hate you. You might lose your friends and even your life!"

Prahlada explained, "The best thing is to know when to be forgiving and when to be strong. Forgive someone who has done good things for you, even if they did something wrong. Forgive someone who made a mistake because they didn't know better. But don't forgive people who do bad things on purpose.  And punish people only after they do something wrong a second time."

Prahlada also said, "Sometimes you have to forgive because youâ€™re afraid of the consequences.  But other times, you have to be strong.  You need to choose wisely when to be kind and when to be strong."

Then Draupadi said, "King, it's time for you to be strong! The Kauravas, the sons of Dhritarashtra, are always mean to us.  We don't need to forgive them anymore. It's time to show your strength!"
