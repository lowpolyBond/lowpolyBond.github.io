Princess Damayanti was very excited! She saw a handsome prince from far away, but she wasn't sure it was him.  She asked her best friend, Kesini, to go and talk to the prince's driver.  Kesini was brave and kind.

"Kesini," Damayanti said, "please be careful and ask the driver some questions. I think this might be King Nala, but I'm not sure.  Be polite and find out who he is, and where he's from."

Kesini tiptoed towards the driver, whose name was Vahuka.  "Hello!" she said politely. "Are you having a nice trip?  Princess Damayanti wants to know why you're here."

Vahuka smiled. "We came because someone told us about Damayanti's wedding!  My master, King Rituparna, wanted to see her. I am his driver. We traveled really, really fast!"

Kesini was curious. "Who is the other man with you?" she asked.

"That's Varshneya," Vahuka replied.  "He used to be King Nala's driver.  After King Nala lost everything, Varshneya went to work for King Bhangasura's son, and then came with us."

Kesini thought for a moment. "Maybe Varshneya knows where King Nala is?"

Vahuka shook his head sadly.  "No one knows where King Nala is. He's wandering the world, lost and changed.  Only he knows where he is."

Kesini then remembered something the wise Brahman had said.  She told Vahuka,  "A woman, waiting for her husband, is very sad! She's heartbroken and alone.  She just wants him to come home."

Vahuka relayed that message to King Rituparna. When he heard it, King Nala's heart ached.  He couldnâ€™t stop the tears from falling.

"Even when things are bad," Nala said sadly, "a good wife never gives up hope. A good wife is always strong and brave."  He cried so much, his voice was shaky.

Kesini rushed back to Damayanti, telling her everything. Damayanti felt so sad to hear about Nala's troubles, but it confirmed her suspicions. She knew in her heart it was truly him.
