Once upon a time, the wise Bhishma told a story about how we get into trouble. He said that bad feelings like anger, greed, and fear come from darkness inside us.  If we get rid of these bad feelings, we become good and understand the big, bright, wonderful world.

But, Bhishma said, we often get tricked!  We want things, and that leads to more wanting. We want things, so we try to get them.  This wanting makes us do things, and those things tie us to the world. These ties make us sad.  We are born, we live, and we die, again and again.

Bhishma explained that we're born because of our past actions. It's like a messy, uncomfortable place to start –  inside our mothers! We are born because of our parents coming together.  Then we grow up, and we have our own children.  Bhishma said these children are like little bugs that grow on us; we love them, but they aren't really part of us, and eventually we will leave them behind.

Our feelings and desires are also very powerful.  Bhishma said that women are especially powerful because they are the source of life. We should be careful, he said, to not let our desires for things and for people, especially women, control us.

Bhishma said that our senses – our eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin – are all connected to our desires. They want to experience the world, but this wanting can keep us trapped in the cycle of birth and death.

Bhishma had a clever solution:  He said we should be wise and learn to control our desires. He said we should learn about the world from smart books and wise people, just like he was doing!  If we don't let our desires rule us, we can be free!  If we stop wanting things so much, we won’t be born again and again. We can escape the cycle and be happy!
