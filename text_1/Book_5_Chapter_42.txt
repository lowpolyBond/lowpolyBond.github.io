King Dhritarashtra was a very wise man. He wanted to understand something very important: death.  He asked a wise holy man, Sanat-sujata, "Some say we can stop death. Others say death is always there. Which is true?"

Sanat-sujata smiled. "Both are true, Your Majesty," he said. "Ignorance is like death.  When we don't understand things, we feel fear. But true knowledge, understanding the world, is like immortality.  The gods are wise, so they live long.  The demons were not wise, so they died or were defeated."

He explained that death isn't like a scary tiger.  It's more like a feeling.  Yama, the god of death, is just a way of talking about bad things like anger, greed, and not understanding. People who are proud and do bad things keep dying and being reborn because they don’t understand the truth.  People who act only to get things they want will always experience death.

Dhritarashtra then asked, "The holy books say good people go to heaven after they die. Why shouldn't I try to be good and go to heaven?"

Sanat-sujata answered, “People who don’t understand the truth go to heaven by being good.  But if you truly understand the world, you don't need heaven. You become free."  He explained that people who want things are always caught in a cycle of life and death.  To be free, you need to stop wanting things.

Dhritarashtra asked another question. He said, “If the universe is created by a powerful, all-knowing being, what does this being do? How does it feel?”

Sanat-sujata replied, "The powerful being is everything. It's the entire universe!  The universe is like this being changing itself.  The holy books say this too."

Dhritarashtra continued, "Some people are good, and some don’t care about being good. Does goodness defeat badness, or does badness defeat goodness?"

Sanat-sujata said, "Both goodness and not caring about doing things lead to freedom. But understanding is the best way. People who only think about the world get good rewards sometimes, but they also make mistakes.  But if they are wise, their goodness overcomes their mistakes."

Dhritarashtra wanted to know about all the different places good people go after they die.

Sanat-sujata said, "People who are really wise and understand the world go to the best place. People who follow the holy books and do good things go to a good place.  Those who only do things for good, but are not truly wise, go to a place that isn't as great. We should help others, but we should not be proud of what we do." He warned that being proud was like a dog eating its own poop; it hurts more than it helps. The best person is a humble person.


Finally, Sanat-sujata said, "True happiness is found not in what we own, but in understanding the world and being good. Six things help us get true happiness: honesty, fairness, humility, self-control, a clean mind and body, and understanding."
