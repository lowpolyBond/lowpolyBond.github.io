Once upon a time, Arjuna, a very strong warrior, was missed by his friends.  Suddenly, a bright, shiny chariot zoomed into view! It was like a shooting star, pulled by horses as bright as lightning.  Arjuna was inside!  He looked amazing, all decked out in shiny jewelry.

The chariot was driven by Matali, who was like a super-driver.  Arjuna landed on a mountain and first greeted his teachers and friends:  he bowed to Dhaumya, Ajatasatru, and Bhima (Vrikodara).  The twins, Nakula and Sahadeva, also greeted him.  Arjuna then went to Krishna, gave her a hug, and then spoke with his brother, Yudhisthira. Everyone was so happy to see him!

They all admired Matali's amazing chariot. It was the same chariot that had once helped Indra (the King of the Gods) defeat a huge army!  They gave Matali lots of gifts and asked about the gods. Matali, like a kind father, gave Arjuna some advice, then zoomed back to heaven in his shiny chariot.

After Matali left, Arjuna gave some beautiful, shiny jewels and ornaments – gifts from Indra – to his dear friend, Krishna's mother. He then told everyone about his trip to heaven.  He learned amazing fighting skills from Indra, the wind god Vayu, and Lord Shiva!  The gods were very happy with him because he was kind and focused.

After telling his exciting story, Arjuna, tired but happy, went to sleep with Nakula and Sahadeva.  What an exciting day!
