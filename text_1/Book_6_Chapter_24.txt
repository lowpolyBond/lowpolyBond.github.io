King Dhritarashtra was watching the big battle from far away. He asked his friend Sanjaya, "Sanjaya, who started the fight?  Who felt brave and strong? Who felt scared?  Who hit first, my sons or the Pandavas? Tell me everything! Whose soldiers smelled the nicest from their flowers and perfumes?  And whose soldiers shouted the loudest?"

Sanjaya answered, "King, both sides were happy and ready to fight.  Both armies smelled equally nice from their flowers and perfumes.  Then, BOOM!  The two armies crashed into each other!  It was so loud!  You could hear trumpets, drums, and lots of soldiers shouting.  The elephants were trumpeting too! It was a scary but exciting battle!"
