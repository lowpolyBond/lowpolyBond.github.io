Karna talked to Krishna.  Krishna was his friend and wanted to help.  Krishna said Karna was really Pandu's son, because of the scriptures.  Karna knew this. His mother, Kunti, had him when she was young.  The sun god, Surya, was his father. Surya told Kunti to leave him.  So she did.

Then, a kind charioteer named Adhiratha found Karna.  Adhiratha and his wife Radha raised Karna. They loved him very much.  Karna considered Adhiratha his father. He performed all his important ceremonies with the Sutras, the people like Adhiratha. He married, had children, and loved them very much.

He became friends with Duryodhana.  Duryodhana gave Karna a kingdom, and Karna ruled for thirteen years.  Because of his friendship with Duryodhana, he was now fighting against the Pandavas.  He was going to fight Arjuna, who was Pandu's son.  

Karna said he couldn't betray Duryodhana. He couldn't stop fighting because of family, fear, or anything else. It would be shameful for both him and Arjuna if they didn't fight.

Krishna told Karna to keep their talk a secret.  If Yudhishthira, the Pandava king, knew Karna was Kunti's son, he wouldn't accept the kingdom.  But even if Karna won, he would give the kingdom to Duryodhana. Yudhishthira was the best ruler because he had the best army and Krishna on his side!  He mentioned the many brave warriors fighting for the Pandavas.

Then Karna described the upcoming battle as a big sacrifice.  Arjuna would be the priest, his bow Gandiva the offering ladle, and the warriors' bravery the ghee (clarified butter).  Each warrior would have a part in this “sacrifice”. The battle would be terrible, but it was destined to happen.

Karna felt bad about the mean things he’d said to the Pandavas because of Duryodhana.  He knew he would die fighting Arjuna.  This whole war was a terrible sacrifice. He asked Krishna not to let all the brave warriors die, but to let them die bravely in battle. The story of the war would be told for many years to come.  He asked Krishna to bring Arjuna to him, and to keep their conversation secret.
