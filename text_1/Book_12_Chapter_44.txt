King Yudhishthira won back his kingdom!  He was so happy. He bowed down to Krishna, a very powerful and wise friend who helped him win.

Yudhishthira said, "Krishna, you are amazing!  Your strength and cleverness helped me get my kingdom back.  I thank you so much!"

Yudhishthira went on and on, praising Krishna. He said Krishna was like the sun, the wind, the ocean, and even a giant boar!  He said Krishna was everywhere, in everything! He was the strongest, wisest, and kindest person ever. He was many different gods all at once.

He called Krishna lots of special names, like Hari, Vishnu, and Jishnu. He said Krishna was born many times. He even said Krishna was the whole universe itself!  Krishna helped everyone.

Yudhishthira praised Krishna for his great power and kindness. He thanked him for his help in winning the war.

Krishna was very happy to hear Yudhishthira's kind words. He smiled and spoke kindly to Yudhishthira, making him even happier.
