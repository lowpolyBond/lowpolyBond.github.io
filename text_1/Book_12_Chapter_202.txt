Long ago, a wise man named Manu told a story about how everything began.  He said, "First, there was nothing but empty space.  Then, wind blew through space.  Then, light shone.  Then, water appeared.  From the water, the whole world grew! And from the world, everything in it came to be."

Manu explained that when things die, they go back to where they came from. They go back to water, then light, then wind, and finally, back to space.  Only special people who understand the world very well don't have to go back. They go to a wonderful place called Brahma.

Brahma is amazing!  It's not hot or cold, big or small, sweet or sour.  You can't see, smell, hear, or taste it. It's beyond all of that.

We see the world with our five senses:  we touch things with our skin, taste with our tongue, smell with our nose, hear with our ears, and see with our eyes.  But to truly understand Brahma, we have to stop focusing on our senses.  We need to look inside ourselves.

Manu said that our "Self" is what makes us do things. It’s what we use to do things, where we do them, and when we do them.  It's what makes us happy or sad. Our Self is everywhere, inside everything.  It's the reason for everything, the highest of the high. It is the ONE thing that created everything else. Everything else is just what happened because of it!

Because of what we do, good things and bad things happen to us.  It’s like good and bad seeds growing together in a plant.  Knowledge, understanding, is like a light that helps us see things clearly.

Our senses are like little lights on tall trees. Knowledge helps them shine brightly and see the world.  Our senses all work together, like helpers for our knowledge.  Knowledge is the boss!

Our bodies are always changing, like fire, wind, sun, and rivers that keep moving.  But our Self is different. We can’t see it by cutting open our bodies, like we can't find fire by chopping wood. We find fire by rubbing sticks together!  We find our true Self by focusing our minds and spirits.

When we dream, we see ourselves sleeping, but we are still *us*.  In the same way, when we die, our bodies are left behind, but our Self continues.  It doesn’t grow old or die.  It moves on to a new body, hidden from view.

No one can see or touch our Self.  Our senses can't reach it, but it feels and knows everything our senses do. The Self just takes on the look of the body it’s in. It’s like putting something in a fire; it changes color, but it’s still the same thing.

When we die, our bodies go back to the earth, water, fire, wind, and space. Our senses go back to where they came from, too.  Everything is connected!  Our mind controls our senses, our understanding guides our mind, and our understanding is guided by our true Self.

Our new body receives all the results of what we did in our old body, and what we'll do in the future.  It’s like fish swimming downstream—our actions follow our minds.  Even though our Self is hidden, our understanding can finally see it. Just like we can see a small thing become big with glasses, or see ourselves in a mirror, our understanding can see the unseen Self.
