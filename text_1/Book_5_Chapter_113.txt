Once upon a time, a wise man named Galava and a giant bird named Garuda were traveling together.  They landed on a high mountain.  There, they met a holy woman named Sandili. She was very peaceful and kind.  She offered them food, and they ate and fell fast asleep.

When Garuda woke up, he was shocked!  His wings were gone! He looked like a big, fluffy ball with only a head and legs. Galava was very worried. "What happened?" he asked.

Garuda confessed, "I had a bad thought. I wanted to take Sandili to a wonderful place where the gods live.  It was a selfish thought."

Sandili was understanding. She said, "It's okay, Garuda.  Being selfish is not a good thing but you've learned your lesson. Never be disrespectful or underestimate anyone, especially women, even if you think they deserve it."  Poof! Garuda's wings grew back, even stronger than before!

They thanked Sandili and flew off. But they still needed to find special horses. Along the way, they met Viswamitra, a powerful man.  Viswamitra reminded Galava of a promise he'd made â€“ to give him some treasures.

Galava was sad. He didn't have the treasures yet.  Garuda helped him. "We have to keep our promises," he said.  "Let's find a way to give Viswamitra what we promised."  And so, their adventure continued, with a new challenge to solve!
