A long time ago, a wise teacher named Parasara was talking to a king.  He said, "I've told you about how to live a good life at home. Now, let's talk about doing good things, called penances."

The teacher explained that people who only care about things like houses, land, and money get sad easily. They love their things so much, they forget they’re not going to last forever.  This makes them greedy and unhappy. They want more and more, even if it means doing bad things. They’re always worried about losing what they have.  This leads to trouble.

But true happiness comes from being kind and doing good deeds.  People who are wise and understand this do good things, not just things they want.  If you lose your things, or get sick, you might feel sad.  But then, you might start to think about what really matters, and learn from the scriptures. That’s when you understand the importance of penances.

Penances are good for everyone, even the humblest person.  They help you become a better person and lead to a good life after death.  Even powerful gods and goddesses did penances to become strong and powerful. Kings and rich people also did penances to gain their wealth and status. They got beautiful clothes, amazing homes, and everything else good through penances. Penances can help you get almost anything good!

The teacher said that even if you're rich or poor, you should always try to be good.  If you're greedy, you get unhappy.  Greed makes you forget what's important, and then you can't tell right from wrong. When you’re unhappy, you should do penances to help yourself.

Happiness comes from doing good.  Unhappiness comes from not doing good.  Good penances bring good things, bad actions bring bad things. If you do good penances, you get good things, like fame and happiness. If you do penances only to get something in return, you will be sad and unhappy.

Even if you try to be good, you might still do something bad. But if you always try your best to be good, even when things are hard, you're like someone who always follows the rules.

The teacher said that the happiness you get from fun things only lasts a little while, like an arrow flying through the air before it falls to the ground.  True happiness lasts forever. Wise people know this and choose kindness over fleeting pleasure.  That’s why they do penances.

Even people with lots of things should still do good things and follow the rules. They should do their best.  Only those who try to be good can truly follow the teachings.  The best thing for good people to do is penances. Everyone, even people with families, should find their place in the world by doing good.  Just like all rivers flow into the ocean, everyone should strive to do good things.
