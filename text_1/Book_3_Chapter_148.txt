Bhima, the strong warrior, bowed to Hanuman, the mighty monkey king.  "I'm so lucky!" he said. "I've met my brother!  I want to see you as you were when you leaped across the ocean!"

Hanuman smiled. "That form is gone, Bhima.  Things were different then.  A long, long time ago, the world was much better.  It was the Krita Yuga, the best time ever!  Then came the Treta Yuga, then the Dwapara Yuga, and now we're in the Kali Yuga.  Each time, things get a little worse. I don't have that giant form anymore."

Bhima asked, "Tell me about those times, those Yugas!"

Hanuman explained, "In the Krita Yuga, everyone was good.  They didn't need rules, because everyone did what was right.  There were no fights, no bad feelings.  Everything was perfect!  There was no buying or selling; people just thought of what they needed, and they had it.

The Treta Yuga was good, too, but not as perfect.  People started doing good things to get good things back. They worshipped and gave gifts.

In the Dwapara Yuga, things got harder.  People started arguing and fighting more.  It wasn't as good as before.  They studied and worshipped less.

Now, in the Kali Yuga, things are even harder.  Good things are rare, and bad things happen more often.  That’s why I don’t have that giant form anymore; everything changes over time.

Bhima said, “Thank you, Hanuman.” Hanuman said, “Don’t worry about my old form. It's time to go home now.”
