King Prahlada was a very smart king. He met a wise old wandering priest.  Prahlada noticed the priest was always calm and happy, no matter what happened.

Prahlada asked, "Wise priest, you’re so peaceful! You don’t seem to want anything, and you don't get upset when things go wrong. How do you do it?"

The priest smiled. "Everything in the world –  animals, plants, even the stars –  starts, grows, gets old, and then disappears.  That's just how it is. I don't get happy or sad because of it.  Everything is connected to its own nature.  Things come together, and then they fall apart. Nothing lasts forever."

"I eat when I get food," the priest explained. "Sometimes it's a big feast, sometimes just a little.  Sometimes I sleep on a soft bed, sometimes on the ground. Sometimes I wear nice clothes, sometimes rags. I just accept whatever happens."

"I follow a special way of life," the priest continued, "called the Ajagara vow.  It's about being peaceful and not wanting too much. It's not about strict rules, but about being happy with what you have. Greedy people chase things they don't need, and get sad when they don't get them.  I see that, and I stay peaceful."

The priest added, "Happiness and sadness, winning and losing – it's all decided before we even know it.  I understand this, so I’m not afraid or worried. I just live peacefully."

King Bhishma, who was telling this story, said,  "The priest's peaceful way of life, the Ajagara vow, helps people live happily without worrying about everything. It teaches us to accept life as it is."
