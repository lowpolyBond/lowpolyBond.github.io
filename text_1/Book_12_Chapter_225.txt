Once upon a time, a powerful god named Indra met a mighty demon king named Vali.  Indra saw a glowing light coming from Vali. It was Lakshmi, the goddess of fortune!

Indra asked Vali, "Who is this shining lady?"

Vali shrugged. "I don't know!  Ask her yourself."

Indra asked Lakshmi, "Who are you?  Why are you leaving Vali?"

Lakshmi answered, "I have many names: Duhshaha, Vidhitsa, Bhuti, Lakshmi, and Sree.  I live in good things: kindness, truthfulness, and hard work. Vali has stopped doing these things. He's become mean and boastful. So, I'm leaving him."

Lakshmi explained that she doesn't stay in one place forever.  Time moves her.  She chose to live with Indra now.

Indra was amazed. He asked Lakshmi how he could keep her.

Lakshmi said, "Share me! Divide me into four parts."

Indra agreed.  He gave one part to the Earth, one to the water, one to the fire, and one to good people.

Then, Vali, feeling sad and angry, made a big boast.  He said, "One day, I will defeat you all!"

Indra smiled.  "Brahma, the creator, said I can't kill you.  Go in peace. The sun always shines in all directions. Your boast won't come true."

Indra went back to the sky, and Vali went to the south.  And that's how Lakshmi, the goddess of fortune, was shared among the world!
