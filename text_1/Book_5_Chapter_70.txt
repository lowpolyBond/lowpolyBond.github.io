King Dhritarashtra was worried.  He asked his friend Sanjaya, "Tell me more about Krishna!  Learning about him makes me feel better."

Sanjaya said, "I know many of Krishna's names!  But he's so amazing, it's hard to describe him fully.

"He's called Vasudeva because he protects everyone. He's called Vishnu because he's everywhere. He's called Madava because he was a wise teacher. He's called Madhusudana because he defeated a mean demon named Madhu.

"He's called Krishna because his name means 'one who exists eternally in peace'.  He's called Pundarikaksha because his home is amazing and forever safe. He's called Janardana because bad people are afraid of him.

"He's called Sattwata because he's always good. He's called Vrishabhakshana because the Vedas, which are like holy books, are his eyes! He's called Aja because he wasn't born like other people.  

"He's called Damodara because he's powerful and always in control. He's called Hrishikesa because he's happy and divine. He's called Mahavahu because he holds up the earth and sky!

"He's called Adhakshaja because he's always strong and never falls. He's called Narayana because he protects everyone. He's called Purusottama because he creates, protects, and even destroys things. He knows everything, so he's called Sarva.  He's always truthful, so he's called Satya.

"He's also called Vishnu for his strength, Jishnu for his victories, Ananta because he's eternal, and Govinda because he understands everything. He can make things seem real even if they're not!  

"This strong, good, and amazing Krishna, the one who defeated Madhu, will come to stop the big fight between the Kauravas and Pandavas."
