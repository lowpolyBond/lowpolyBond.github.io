King Janamejaya had done something wrong.  He felt really, really bad about it.  He talked to a wise man named Saunaka.

"I've been a bad king," Janamejaya said, "I hurt some holy people, the Brahmins. I'm so sorry! I'm scared!  Please help me." He felt like a burning fire inside.

Saunaka was wise and kind. He said, "It's okay to make mistakes.  Wise people understand that everyone makes them.  Don't be so hard on yourself."

Saunaka explained that being wise means helping others.  He said, "Think about the Brahmins. Show them you’re sorry.  Treat them with kindness and respect. If you do good things, you'll feel better."

Janamejaya was very relieved. "I'm truly sorry!" he said. "I promise to be a good king and never hurt the Brahmins again!"

Saunaka smiled. "Good," he said. "Show everyone you’re a better king now.  Help everyone, always remember what is right, and be kind to everyone, especially the Brahmins.”

Saunaka continued, "Some people might be angry with me for helping you, but that's okay.  I'm doing what's right. It's more important to help you become a better king and to make sure you never hurt anyone again."

Janamejaya touched Saunaka’s feet.  "I swear, I will never hurt the Brahmins again, not even in my thoughts!" he promised.  And he kept his promise. He became a much kinder and better king.
