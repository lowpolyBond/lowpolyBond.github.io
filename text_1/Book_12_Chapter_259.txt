Yudhishthira, the king, was confused.  "Grandpa," he asked, "what is righteousness? Where does it come from? Is it just for this life, or the next, or both?"

His grandfather, Bhishma, smiled. "Righteousness comes from three places," he said. "First, from what good people do. Second, from the ancient holy books, like the Vedas. Third, from the reason behind what you do.  Wise people also say there's a fourth: the purpose of your actions."

"Long ago," Bhishma continued, "wise people decided what was right and wrong.  Righteousness makes you happy, in this life and the next.  Doing bad things makes you unhappy. Some people think you can never truly get rid of bad deeds.  But even if you lie during hard times, or do something wrong, you might still gain some good from it.  But your actions—how you behave—are the most important part of righteousness."

Bhishma told a story: "Even a thief, who takes things that don't belong to him, might use that stolen money to seem good. He might even want the king to punish someone who steals *from him*!  Yet, secretly, he still wants other people's things. But telling the truth is always best. Truth is the most important thing.  Everything is held together by truth. Even bad people need truth to work together."

"Never take what is not yours," Bhishma said. "Strong people often ignore this rule, but when they are in trouble, they see how important it is.  Being strong doesn't always mean being happy.  Don't ever do anything wrong.  If you are good, you won't fear bad people or the king. A person with a pure heart is happy and fearless.  They don't judge others based on their own mistakes."

Bhishma added, "Giving to others in need is also very important.  Rich people might think this is a rule made for poor people. But when they become poor, they understand its value. Being rich doesn't guarantee happiness."

"Never do something to someone that you wouldn't want done to you," he said. "Imagine a man who is unfaithful to his wife. He wouldn't like it if someone did that to him!  Don't hurt others.  Treat others as you want to be treated. Share your extra wealth with those in need.  That is why we're told to work hard and be successful."

"Follow the path to goodness," Bhishma concluded. "When you have much, share it generously.  Being kind and peaceful is righteousness. The Creator made righteousness to hold the world together.  Remember these things, Yudhishthira, and never do what is wrong."
