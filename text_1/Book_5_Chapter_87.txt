King Dhritarashtra, everyone loved and respected you! You're wise and old, so your words are always right.  Everyone trusts you to do what's good.  You're known for being kind and fair.

But Vidura, a wise man, saw something else.  He said, "King, you say you want to give Krishna many gifts. But that's not true! You're trying to trick him."

"The Pandavas, your own nephews, only want five villages.  But you won't give them even that! You don't want peace. You're trying to use your riches to get Krishna on your side, to separate him from the Pandavas."

Vidura knew Krishna very well.  "You can't buy Krishna's friendship with gifts.  He's loyal to Arjuna, his best friend, like brothers!"

"Krishna is simple," Vidura explained.  "He only wants a small offering.  He really wants peace between you and the Pandavas. He wants you to be a good father to them."

"You are their uncle," Vidura reminded him. "They are like your own sons. Be kind to them. They love and respect you. Listen to Krishna's advice, and make peace.  That is the best gift you can give."
