Once upon a time, in the land of Bharat, a wise old man named Bhishma told a story.  He said, "Some people love to do things, and that's okay! Others love learning, and that's good too!  But the wisest people try to stop wanting things so much."

Bhishma explained that wanting things – like toys or treats – can keep us from being happy.  It’s like mixing gold with iron; the gold loses its shine.  If we are always angry or greedy, we can’t truly be happy. Our bodies are made of earth, water, and air, just like everything else. We shouldn't be attached to them.

He said it's like a house made of mud. We eat food, which is also made of mud, to keep it strong.  Even hermits in the forest eat simple food, just enough to live. We should live simply, like taking medicine when we're sick.

Bhishma told the story to a king named Yudhishthira. Yudhishthira asked, "How can we stop wanting things so much?  Which bad feelings are the hardest to let go of?"

Bhishma answered, "It's like cutting a steel chain with a steel axe.  The axe might break, but it gets rid of the chain! We need to get rid of bad feelings like anger and greed. These feelings are like seeds that grow bad things.  Good feelings are like sunshine, making everything brighter."

He said that doing good things, like helping others, can help us let go of bad feelings. If we follow good thoughts and actions, we can be happy and peaceful.  We must avoid bad things like being lazy or mean. It's important to be kind and do what's right.

Bhishma said that good feelings bring happiness and peace. Bad feelings like anger and sadness bring unhappiness. We should try to be good, kind, and thoughtful, and let go of the bad feelings.  Then we can be peaceful and happy, just like the wisest people.
