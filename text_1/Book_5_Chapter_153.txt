The Pandavas needed a place to set up their camp for the big battle.  Yudhishthira, the kind and fair king, chose a perfect spot! It was flat and grassy, a nice cool place with plenty of wood for fires.  He made sure to avoid any holy places or graveyards.

He picked a beautiful, open area that felt special.  After his soldiers and animals rested, Yudhishthira and his army, along with thousands of other kings, marched joyfully to the spot.  Krishna and Arjuna helped to get everything organized, making sure the army was ready.  Dhrishtadyumna and Satyaki, two strong warriors, planned where everyone would sleep.

They found a lovely river, the Hiranwati, with smooth, clean water. Krishna had a big ditch dug around the camp for extra protection, and put soldiers there to guard it.  They made sure everyone had a safe and comfortable tent.  The tents for the kings were like fancy palaces! They had plenty of food, water, and wood.  There were lots of skilled workers, doctors, and mechanics to help everyone.

Yudhishthira made sure there were tons of supplies: arrows, bows, armor, food, and medicine – everything an army needed!  Giant elephants, strong enough to fight many enemies, were also ready.  When the Pandavas’ friends heard that the camp was ready, they arrived with their own soldiers and animals, ready to fight alongside them. Many kings who were very holy and had helped people came to support the Pandavas.
