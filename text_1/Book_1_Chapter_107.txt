Once upon a time, there was a very holy man named Mandavya. He was super good and spent all his time praying and being quiet. He sat under a tree, his arms raised high, never saying a word.

One day, some robbers ran past his tree, hiding their stolen things nearby.  Soon, the police came looking for the robbers.  They asked Mandavya, "Where did the robbers go?"  But Mandavya was so quiet, he didn't answer.

The police searched and found the robbers and their loot.  They thought Mandavya helped the robbers hide!  They were very angry.  They tied Mandavya to a big wooden stake, just like a very bad punishment.

Even though he was tied up and hungry, Mandavya didn't die! He was so strong because he was so holy. Other holy men, like magical birds, came to see him. They were sad and asked, "Why are you being punished like this?"

Mandavya was a very good and holy man.  He was punished for not speaking when he should have. Because of this unfair punishment, later on, the gods had to deal with the consequences.
