Yudhishthira, the good king, won the great war!  A shining chariot came for him, sent by Indra, the king of the gods.  But Yudhishthira saw his brothers lying on the ground.

"My brothers must come with me!" he cried.  "And Draupadi, my brave wife, too! I won't go to heaven without them!"

Indra smiled. "Don't worry," he said. "Your brothers are already in heaven, with Krishna. They left their bodies, but they're there, waiting for you."

Yudhishthira was sad, but he still had a loyal dog.  "This dog is my friend," Yudhishthira said. "He must come with me."

Indra frowned. "Heaven doesn't allow dogs," he explained. "But you've won amazing thingsâ€”even immortality! Just leave the dog."

But Yudhishthira refused.  "It's wrong to abandon a friend," he said. "It's as bad as hurting a good person.  I made a promise to never leave anyone who needs help!"

Indra tried again. "Dogs take away good luck in heaven!" he said.  "Leave the dog, and you'll come to heaven!"

Yudhishthira shook his head.  "I already left my brothers when they died.  I can't leave my friend now."

The dog was, surprisingly, Dharma, the god of goodness! Dharma smiled. "You are kind and good," he said.  "You chose goodness over heaven! You're the best!"

Indra, Dharma, and many other gods were very impressed.  They took Yudhishthira to heaven on a shining chariot!  Everyone was amazed.  A god named Narada said, "No one has ever been so good as Yudhishthira! He even went to heaven in his own body!"

But Yudhishthira was still sad. He wanted to be with his brothers and Draupadi.

Indra said, "You've won a wonderful place in heaven, Yudhishthira!  You've done great things! But you're still thinking about your family."

Yudhishthira said, "I can't be happy away from my family. I want to be with them, even if it means not being here."

Then, Indra told him that his family was already with him in the glorious heaven he had won, and he could be with them.  The end.
