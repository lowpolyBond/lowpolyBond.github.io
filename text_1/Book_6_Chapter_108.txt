The sun went down, and the great battle ended for the day.  Yudhishthira saw his soldiers were scared and running away.  Bhishma, the powerful warrior, was winning.  He was so strong, he made everyone afraid!  Yudhishthira decided to pull his army back for the night.  The Kurus did the same.

That night, the Pandavas, their friends, and allies met to talk. Yudhishthira was very sad.  He said, "Bhishma is like a fire, burning up our army! He's too strong.  He's like a huge elephant crushing reeds. I feel like a tiny insect flying into a fire! I want to give up the battle and go live in the forest."

Krishna, a wise and powerful friend, listened.  He said, "Don't worry! Your brothers are strong warriors.  Arjuna and Bhima are powerful, like the wind and fire!  And I will fight Bhishma too!  Arjuna promised to kill Bhishma a long time ago.  He must keep his promise.  Or, I will fight Bhishma myself."

Yudhishthira was worried about breaking a promise to Bhishma.  He said, "I promised to not trick Bhishma.  But I need your help."

Krishna agreed to help, but not by fighting directly. They decided to ask Bhishma for advice.  They went to Bhishma's tent and asked how they could win.

Bhishma said, "As long as I'm alive, you can't win. But if you defeat me, you will win the war.  So, defeat me."

Yudhishthira asked, "But how? You’re unbeatable!"

Bhishma explained, "I have a rule: I don’t fight women.  There's a warrior named Sikhandin in your army, who used to be a woman.  If Arjuna fights me with Sikhandin in front, I won't fight back. Then, Arjuna can defeat me."

Arjuna felt sad. Bhishma was like a grandfather to him.  He didn’t want to fight him.

Krishna said, "Arjuna, you promised. You must fight. It's a warrior's duty.  Bhishma’s death is written in the stars, and it must happen."

Arjuna agreed. He would use Sikhandin to defeat Bhishma.  They all went back to their tents, ready for the next day's battle.
