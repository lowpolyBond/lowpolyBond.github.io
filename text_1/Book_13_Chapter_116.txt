Once upon a time, in the land of Bharat, a good king named Yudhishthira was sad.  He saw people eating meat.  "They only want meat," he sighed, "like scary Rakshasas! They don't even like yummy cakes or tasty vegetables as much as meat! I'm confused. Is meat really the best food?"

He asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, "What's good and bad about eating meat?  Tell me everything!"

Bhishma said, "You're right, Yudhishthira, meat tastes wonderful! It makes weak people strong and healthy.  But there's something even better than the taste – not eating meat at all!  Think about it:  it's cruel to take a life to make yourself stronger.  Nothing is more precious than life, even your own life!  We should be kind to all living things."

Bhishma explained that meat comes from a living creature's very life force.  It's bad to eat it unless it’s offered as a gift to the gods in a special ceremony.  Hunters who kill animals for food, aren't always bad.  Sometimes, they have to hunt to survive, and it's like a fair fight – the animal fights back!  But the very best thing, better than anything else, is being kind to every living creature.

"A kind person has nothing to fear," Bhishma said. "Animals and even scary creatures like ghosts won’t harm them!  Kindness is the greatest gift.  It’s the best way to live, the best way to be strong, and the best way to be happy."

Bhishma told Yudhishthira about how animals are born and live. They suffer in many ways before they die.  Those who kill animals for meat might suffer the same fate someday.   It's a cruel circle.

"Kindness is the best religion," said Bhishma. "It’s the best self-control, the best gift, the best punishment, the best sacrifice, the best power, the best friend, the best happiness, and the best truth!"  Bhishma said that kindness is better than any other good deed.  A kind person is like a parent to all creatures.

"Being kind," Bhishma concluded, "has more good points than you could hear in a hundred years!"
