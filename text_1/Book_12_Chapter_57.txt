Once upon a time, in the land of Bharat, a wise old warrior named Bhishma taught a king named Yudhishthira about being a good ruler.

Bhishma said, "A king must always be ready to work!  A king who is lazy and doesn't do anything is not a good king."  He told a story about a wise man who said a king who avoids battles is like a mouse swallowed by the earth!  The same goes for a priest who loves his family too much and forgets his duties.

Bhishma said, "A good king makes peace with some enemies, but fights others. Even if it's his teacher or friend, if someone hurts his kingdom, the king must stop them.  A long time ago, King Sagara sent his son away because the son was hurting people!  Another king sent his son away because he tricked people with empty promises. A good king always tells the truth and cares for his people. He shares his wealth and forgives mistakes.  He follows the rules and controls his anger."

Bhishma explained that a good king keeps secrets. He protects everyone in his kingdom. He must be smart and choose good advisors, but not trust them too much! He needs to know what is happening in his kingdom, and who is good or bad.

"A great king is like Yama (the god of justice), fair and just, and like Kuvera (the god of wealth), rich and wise," Bhishma said.  "He helps the poor, talks kindly, and respects his elders. He never steals and always does what is right. He should choose brave, honest, and loyal helpers. He should treat everyone fairly. A king who is greedy and mean is easily overthrown.  But a good king, who loves his people, will always be strong.  He will be like a mountain, strong and steady."

Bhishma said, the best king is kind, wise, and quick to act. He isn't angry or mean. His people trust him and feel safe. They work hard, and they're not afraid to do what is right, even if it's hard.  A truly great king makes sure everyone is happy and honest, and nobody is jealous or tricks others.  He loves wisdom and helps his people.

Bhishma ended with a story from long ago. It said, you should choose a good king to live under, then choose a wife, and then work to get rich.  If there's no good king, what's the use of your wife or your wealth?  A good king protects his people; that's the most important thing.   Another wise man said that you should stay far away from a teacher who doesnâ€™t speak, a priest who doesn't study, a king who doesn't protect, a mean wife, a wandering cowherd, and a barber who wants to live in the woods!  They are all bad omens!
