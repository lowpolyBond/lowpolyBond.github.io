Once upon a time, in the land of Bharat, a good king named Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandpa, how can I live a happy life, both now and forever?"

Bhishma smiled.  "My dear king," he said, "to have a good life, you must avoid doing bad things.  There are three bad things you shouldn't do with your body."

"What are they?" asked Yudhishthira.

"First," said Bhishma, "never hurt or kill any living thing. Second, never take anything that doesn't belong to you. And third, never do anything wrong with someone else's wife or husband."

"And what about bad things with my words?" Yudhishthira asked.

"Ah, yes," Bhishma replied. "Never say mean things.  Never speak harshly to anyone. Never tell secrets about other people. And never, ever tell lies."

"What about bad thoughts?" asked Yudhishthira.

Bhishma nodded.  "Never be jealous of what others have.  Never wish harm on anyone. And always believe in good things."

"So," Bhishma concluded, "be good with your body, your words, and your mind. If you do good things, good things will happen to you. If you do bad things, bad things will happen. It's as simple as that!"
