Once upon a time, King Nala was very sad. He had left his beautiful wife, Damayanti.  Lost and alone in a dark forest, he saw a huge fire!  

Suddenly, he heard a voice calling, "King Nala, help me!"  Brave Nala walked right into the fire!  There, he found a giant snake named Karkotaka.

Karkotaka was scared and explained, "A powerful magical man cursed me! I have to stay here until someone named Nala saves me."

Karkotaka asked Nala for help.  He promised to be Nala's friend. He magically became tiny, small enough to fit on Nala's thumb! Nala carried him away from the fire.

Once they were safe, Karkotaka asked Nala to walk just a few more steps.  But when Nala took the tenth step, Karkotaka bit him!  

Suddenly, Nala's body changed! He looked completely different!  Karkotaka explained, "I changed your looks so no one will recognize you. This will help you get away from the person who tricked you."  

Karkotaka continued, "The person who hurt you will be trapped inside you, suffering from my bite. But don't worry, you won't feel any pain. You'll win every battle.  Go to Ayodhya and meet King Rituparna.  Tell him you're a charioteer named Vahuka. He'll teach you how to play dice. Once you're good at dice, you'll get your kingdom and your family back!"

Karkotaka gave Nala two special clothes.  He said, "If you want to look like yourself again, just wear these clothes and think of me." Then, poof! Karkotaka disappeared.
