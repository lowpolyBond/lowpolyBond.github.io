Once upon a time, in the land of ancient India, wise people talked about how to please the gods.

Surya, the sun god, said, "To please me, on a full moon night, face the bright moon and offer a little water and some rice with ghee (melted butter).  It's like giving a gift to your own special fire."  He added, "Never cut down a big tree on a new moon night, or even a single leaf! It's very bad luck. And don't chew on a toothbrush that day either – it angers the moon god!"  If you don’t follow these rules, the gods won't be happy, and your family might have bad luck.

Another wise person, Sree, said, "Gods and ancestors don’t like messy homes! If your house is untidy, with things scattered everywhere and people are unhappy, the gods will leave."

Angiras said, "If you want a big family, light a lamp every night for a whole year under a Karanjaka tree and hold some Suvarchala roots."  It’s like magic!

Gargya explained, "Always be kind to guests. Keep your home well-lit when you pray, and don't sleep during the day! Don’t eat meat and never hurt cows or wise people (Brahmanas). Always say the names of holy places – it’s very good. Being good is better than doing a hundred big religious ceremonies."

He added, "The gods don’t like it if a sick person is near when you are praying, and they'll be angry for 13 years if you let them be there. Wear white clothes and be clean when you pray."

Dhaumya warned, "Broken things are unlucky!  Broken pots, beds, and having chickens or dogs around is bad.  Trees inside your house are also unlucky because snakes and scorpions might live there!"

Finally, Jamadagni said, "Even if you do lots of big religious ceremonies, if your heart isn't good, you won't go to a happy place. Being good and kind is the most important thing.  Even a very poor person can please the gods if they are kind and give what little they have." So, be kind, be clean, and be good to everyone!
