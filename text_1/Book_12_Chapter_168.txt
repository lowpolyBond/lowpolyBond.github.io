Once upon a time, a prince named Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandpa, what makes a good friend?  What kind of people should I be friends with?"

Bhishma smiled. "Good question, Yudhishthira!  Let me tell you about good friends and bad friends."

Bhishma explained that bad friends are greedy, mean, dishonest, lazy, and always complaining. They don't care about others, break promises, and are suspicious of everyone.  They ignore their duties, disrespect their teachers, and do lots of bad things.  They don’t keep their friends when they’re sad or having trouble.  They are angry all the time and only think about themselves. They are also cruel and love to gamble.  “Stay away from these people!” Bhishma said.

Then Bhishma talked about good friends.  Good friends are kind, helpful, truthful, and always willing to work hard. They are smart, polite, and grateful.  They are brave and strong. They are happy to help their friends even if it means giving up something themselves.  They are never mean, and they don’t get mad easily.  They always stick by their friends, no matter what.  "These are the friends you want," Bhishma said.  "A king with good friends will have a strong and happy kingdom!"

Yudhishthira said, "Grandpa, tell me more about bad friends. Especially the ones who hurt their friends and are ungrateful.”

Bhishma said, "I'll tell you a story.  Long ago, there was a Brahmin (a holy man) who wasn't very good at his job. He was poor and wanted to be rich, so he went to a village of robbers."

The village had a kind robber chief who was generous to Brahmins. The poor Brahmin asked for a home and food for a year. The robber chief gave him a new cloth, a young widow to help him, and a house! The Brahmin was happy and lived there for many years.  He learned to hunt and became a skilled hunter but he forgot about being a kind Brahmin. He started to kill lots of birds every day.

One day, an old friend, a very good Brahmin, came to visit. He was shocked to see how his friend had changed.  He was covered in blood, and was hunting and killing animals like the robbers. The old friend said, "My friend, what are you doing? You're a Brahmin! You should be kind and study holy books, not hunting and killing!"

The Brahmin felt sad. He said, "I'm poor and I did this for money.  But seeing you makes me want to change.  Stay with me tonight, and tomorrow we will leave this place." The good Brahmin spent the night, refusing to eat the food the other Brahmin offered.  The story shows how important it is to be a good friend, and how easy it is to become a bad friend.  It’s best to stay away from bad friends, just like the good Brahmin did.
