Sanjaya said, "Karna listened to Krishna.  Krishna was very wise.  Karna bowed to Krishna and said, 'Krishna, you know everything. Why are you tricking me?  Duryodhana, Sakuni, Dussasana, and I – we are causing a big war!  A huge battle is coming between the Pandavas and the Kauravas.  It will be terrible! Many kings will die.  I've seen scary signs.  Bad things are happening!  The stars and planets show the Kauravas will lose, and the Pandavas will win.

The elephants are crying, and the horses are sad. They don't want to eat or drink.  The Kaurava soldiers are eating little but pooping a lot! That's a bad sign. The Pandava animals are happy and healthy.  Good birds are with the Pandavas.  Bad birds are with the Kauravas.  The Kaurava drums are quiet.  The Pandava drums make noise even without being hit!  The wells in the Kaurava camp are roaring like angry bulls. The gods are even raining blood on the Kauravas!  I saw scary things in a dream: Yudhishthira and his brothers were happy and safe. But you, Krishna, were fighting, and Bhima was eating a big sweet treat on a pile of bones!  I saw Arjun on a white elephant, ready to fight.  I saw bad signs for the Kauravas.  I saw Bhishma and Drona going towards a place of death.  We’re all going to die!'"

Krishna said, "Karna, if you don't listen to me, the world will end!"

Karna said, "If we live through this war, Krishna, we'll see each other again. If not, we'll meet in heaven!"

Sanjaya said, "Karna hugged Krishna tightly. Then he went back home, very sad."
