King Duryodhana decided to have a big, important sacrifice.  He built a beautiful golden plow for it!  All his friends and family were excited.  Wise Vidura helped plan everything.

Duryodhana sent messengers to invite everyone, including the Pandavas, his cousins who lived in the forest.  One messenger went to the Pandavas and said, "King Duryodhana is having a great sacrifice!  He wants you to come!"

Yudhishthira, the oldest Pandava, was polite. He said, "That's kind of Duryodhana, but we've made a promise to stay in the forest for thirteen years. We can't come now."

Bhima, the strong Pandava, was angry. He told the messenger, "Tell Duryodhana we'll come after thirteen years... when we fight him!"  The other Pandavas didn't say anything mean.

The messenger went back and told Duryodhana.  Lots of important people came to the sacrifice.  They ate delicious food and received beautiful gifts.  King Dhritarashtra was very happy.  Vidura made sure everyone had plenty to eat and drink. He gave them nice clothes and places to stay.

After the party, Dhritarashtra said goodbye to all the guests. He went home with his family and friends, very happy with how the sacrifice went.
