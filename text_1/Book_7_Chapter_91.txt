Arjuna, the mighty warrior, was fighting a big battle!  Drona, his teacher, chased him.  But Arjuna was super strong!  He shot arrows everywhere.  Horses fell, chariots crashed, and even elephants tumbled down!  The enemy army was scared.

Arjuna and Drona fought hard.  Drona shot twenty-five arrows at Arjuna, but Arjuna was quick! He used a special magic weapon, the Brahma weapon, to stop them.  It was amazing to watch Drona fight, but even though Arjuna tried his best, he couldn't hit Drona with a single arrow!  It was like Drona was a huge raincloud, showering arrows down on Arjuna!

Arjuna kept fighting bravely. Drona hit Arjuna and Krishna with lots of arrows.  Arjuna smiled and kept fighting back.  He cleverly avoided Drona's arrows and fought other warriors.  He fought Kritavarman, a powerful warrior, and shot lots of arrows at him.  Kritavarman fought back, too! They kept shooting arrows at each other.

Krishna told Arjuna, "Don't be kind to Kritavarman! Defeat him!"  Arjuna fought Kritavarman's friends, Yudhamanyu and Uttamaujas.  They all shot arrows back and forth.

Then another warrior, Srutayudha, joined the fight. He shot arrows at Arjuna and Krishna.  Arjuna was angry and shot many arrows back! Srutayudha had a special magic mace that was supposed to keep him safe. But he broke the rules, threw the mace at Krishna, and the mace bounced back, killing Srutayudha!  Everyone was shocked.

Next, Sudakshina, another strong warrior, fought Arjuna.  They both shot many arrows. Sudakshina threw a special iron dart, like a shooting star, at Arjuna.  Arjuna was hurt but got better quickly!  Then Arjuna was so angry that he defeated Sudakshina, and Sudakshina fell to the ground.

When everyone saw Srutayudha and Sudakshina were defeated, the rest of the army ran away! The battle was over for now.
