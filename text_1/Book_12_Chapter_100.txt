Once upon a time, a wise king named Yudhishthira asked his grandfather, Bhishma, a very brave warrior,  "Grandpa, how can a king win a battle, even if it means bending the rules a little?"

Bhishma smiled. "Some say being good and honest always wins," he said. "Others say clever tricks work best.  I'll tell you how a king can use both!"

Bhishma explained that a king needs to be smart. He needs to know how to trick bad guys, like sneaky robbers, to protect his people and kingdom.  He needs strong warriors and lots of weapons!  Think shining armor, sharp swords, pointy spears, and strong shields!  He also needs brave elephants and strong horses, all ready to fight!

The best time to fight, Bhishma said, is when the weather is nice, and the crops are ready to be harvested. But if the enemy is weak, you attack anytime!  It's important to choose a good path for the army to travel – a safe one with plenty of water and grass for the horses and elephants.  Spies should check the path ahead to make sure it's safe.  The army shouldn't go crashing through forests like a herd of elephants!

Bhishma told Yudhishthira about setting up camp. A good place is near a forest, for safety. The soldiers should be ready to fight right away when the enemy attacks.  They should position themselves so the sun and wind are at their backs, for good luck.  Different soldiers are good at fighting in different places.  Soldiers on foot are best in the woods, horse riders are good on open land, and elephants are strong in swampy areas.

Most importantly, Bhishma said, never attack sleeping people, hungry people, or anyone who is hurt or scared.  Never attack someone praying, or someone running away! It's not fair!

Bhishma then talked about rewarding brave soldiers.  He said to give extra food, honor, and even a better job to anyone who fights bravely. Those who run away are cowards, and they should be ashamed.  Winning a battle brings happiness and honor; losing brings only sadness and shame.

"To win," Bhishma said, "you must be brave and ready to fight hard. Your best soldiers should be at the front, protecting the others.  Encourage those who are scared. Even if you have a small army, if you're clever and brave, you can still win!"

Finally, Bhishma said that making lots of noise—blowing horns, beating drums—can scare the enemy, making them think your army is much bigger than it really is!  This, he said, is how a king can win a battle.
