Once upon a time, while a wise man named Dhaumya was talking, another wise man, Rishi Lomasa, arrived.  Yudhishthira, the oldest Pandava brother, and his friends gathered around Rishi Lomasa, just like angels gather around the king of the gods.

Yudhishthira asked Rishi Lomasa why he had come.  Lomasa smiled and said, "I visited the king of the gods in heaven.  I saw your brother Arjuna! He was sitting right next to the king!"

Lomasa was amazed. The king of the gods told Lomasa to go see the Pandavas. He also said that Arjuna had gotten a super-powerful weapon from the god Shiva!  It was called the Brahmastra, a very, very strong weapon.  Arjuna also got other amazing weapons from other gods, and even learned to sing, dance, and play music!

"The king of the gods sent me to tell you," Lomasa said to Yudhishthira. "Arjuna will be coming back soon.  Until then, you and your brothers should pray and be good.  That is very important."

Lomasa also knew about Karna, a powerful warrior.  "Karna is strong," Lomasa said, "but Arjuna is much, much stronger. Don't worry about Karna.  When Arjuna comes back, your fear will go away."

Lomasa told Yudhishthira to listen carefully to the advice he would give on important holy places to visit.  He said that the best thing to do is to pray and be good, and that will help them achieve great things.
