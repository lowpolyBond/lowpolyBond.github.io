Long ago, a giant monster named Vritra was very, very bad. He was so big, he took up all the land and the sky!  He had lots of scary friends called Kalakeyas, who were huge and mean.

The good gods, led by Indra, wanted to stop Vritra. Indra had a super powerful hammer called the Vajra.  The gods fought the Kalakeyas. It was a HUGE, noisy battle!  Heads flew everywhere, like coconuts falling from a tree!

But the Kalakeyas were strong. They were like fiery mountains moving towards the gods. The gods got scared and ran away!  Indra felt very sad and scared.

He went to Vishnu, a super-strong god, for help. Vishnu gave Indra extra power!  Then, all the other gods and good people gave Indra even more power.  Indra became super strong!

Vritra roared so loudly that the earth, sky, and mountains shook!  But Indra, now super strong, threw his Vajra.  BOOM! He hit Vritra, and the monster fell down like a giant mountain!

Even though he won, Indra was still scared and ran away. But the other gods were happy! They cheered for Indra and fought the rest of Vritra's friends.

The scared Kalakeyas ran away and hid in the ocean.  They were still angry, though. They made a plan.  They decided to destroy all the good people who knew about being good and kind.  They thought if they destroyed those people, the whole world would fall apart.  The Kalakeyas were happy with their evil plan, and they hid in the ocean to make it happen.
