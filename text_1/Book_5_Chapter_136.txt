Once upon a time, Prince Sanjaya was very scared.  He was losing a big battle! His kingdom was in danger.  His mother, Kunti, saw how sad he was.

"Sanjaya, my son," she said, "even when things are bad, a king must be brave.  When the king is scared, everyone gets scared!  Soldiers run away.  People turn against the king.  But your true friends will stay by your side, even if they can't help much, like a cow waiting for her tied-up calf. You have many good friends who care about you and your kingdom. Don't let your fear push them away! I told you all this to make you strong. I want to test your courage and wisdom."

Kunti then shared a secret. "We have hidden treasure!  I know where it is, and I'll give it to you. You also have loyal friends who will always fight with you.  Use your strength and courage! Fight for what's right!"

Sanjaya listened to his mother. Her words made him feel better. He wasn't so scared anymore!

"Mother," he said, "with you guiding me, I will win back my kingdom, or I will die trying!  Your words are like magical medicine!  I'm ready to fight!"

Kunti smiled.  "My son," she said, "you are brave! Every king should hear this story to become stronger. Itâ€™s called the Jaya story.  It gives people the power to win battles.  It even helps mothers have brave sons!"

And so, Sanjaya, thanks to his mother's wise words and bravery, fought hard and won!  The end.
