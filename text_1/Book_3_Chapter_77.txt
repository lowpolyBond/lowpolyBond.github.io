King Nala and his beautiful wife, Damayanti, spent the night at Damayanti's father's palace.  The next morning, they politely greeted the king.  Damayanti's dad, King Bhima, was so happy to see them! He welcomed them warmly and made them feel loved.

Everyone in the city was overjoyed to see Nala back.  They cheered and decorated the whole place with pretty flowers and flags.  They even put flowers on their doors and at their temples!

King Rituparna, who had helped Nala in disguise, heard the good news. He was happy for Nala and Damayanti. He felt a little bad, just in case he'd been unkind to Nala while he was staying with him.  He asked Nala to forgive him.

Nala was very kind. He said Rituparna hadn't done anything wrong, and he forgave him.  In fact, Nala said he'd been happier living with Rituparna than in his own palace!  He even taught Rituparna all about horses.  In return, Rituparna taught Nala more about games.

Then, Rituparna went back to his own city.  Nala and Damayanti didn't stay in that city for long. They had a happy journey home.
