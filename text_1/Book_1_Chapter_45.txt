Once upon a time, a very holy man named Jaratkaru lived a simple life. He wandered the world, sleeping wherever the sun went down. He ate only air and didn't want any earthly things. He was so holy that he grew very thin.

One day, he saw his ancestors! They were stuck in a hole, hanging upside down by a thin root. A big rat was slowly eating the root.  The ancestors were very sad and hungry.

Jaratkaru felt very sorry for them. He asked, "Who are you?  Why are you hanging here? I'll do anything to help!"

The ancestors explained, "We are your family. We're here because we didn't have children.  A long, long time ago, someone important said having children is very important.  We are slowly being eaten by Time, like this root.  Only you can save us, Jaratkaru.  You are the only one left in our family line. You need to get married and have children!"

They explained that Jaratkaru's hard work and holy life weren't enough to save them. Only having a son would help them. The ancestors said that his family line, represented by the root, was getting eaten away by Time, the big rat. Jaratkaru was the last little bit of the root, and if he didn't get married and have children, he would be pulled down into the hole too.

Jaratkaru listened carefully. He understood that he needed to do what his ancestors asked. He finally realized that being a good father was just as important as being holy.  He knew exactly what he had to do.
