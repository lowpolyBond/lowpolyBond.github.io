Rama and his friends were so happy! They had defeated the ten-headed monster, Ravana.  The gods and goddesses showered them with flowers and sang happy songs.  Everyone celebrated!

Rama gave Lanka, the monster's island kingdom, to Vibhishana, Ravana's good brother.  An old, wise advisor named Avindhya brought Sita back.  Sita looked sad and dirty. She had been through a lot.

Rama was worried. He didn't know if Sita had been faithful. He said, "Sita, you are free to go.  I can't be sure."  This made Sita very, very sad. She fell to the ground, crying.

Suddenly, the gods appeared!  Brahma, the creator of the world, Indra the king of the gods, and many others came to help.  They all said Sita was innocent.  The wind god, the fire god, and the god of water all said she was true.

Sita prayed, "If I did anything wrong, let the air, fire, water, earth, and space leave me!"  Nothing happened.  She was innocent!

Brahma explained that he had protected Sita.  Ravana was punished for what he did.  Dasaratha, Rama's father, appeared in the sky and told Rama to take Sita back.

Rama was happy! He took Sita back.  He gave Avindhya and Trijata, a kind Rakshasa woman, gifts. He asked the gods for help. He asked them to bring back the monkeys who had died fighting, and they did!  He also asked to always be brave and good. Sita gave Hanuman, the brave monkey, a special gift: he would always have food and a long life.

Then, all the gods went away.  Rama, Sita, and his friends returned to their home on a magical flying chariot. He thanked all the monkeys for their help.  Rama made Angada the new king of the monkeys.

Back in Ayodhya, Ramaâ€™s brother Bharata was so happy to see him! He gave Rama the kingdom.  Rama held a big celebration.  He even gave the magical chariot back to the god who owned it.  Then he had a big party to celebrate!  Rama was a great king, and everyone loved him.
