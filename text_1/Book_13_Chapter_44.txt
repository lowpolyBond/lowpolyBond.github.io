Once upon a time, in a land far away, a king named Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandpa, what's the most important thing in the world? What's the most important duty?"

Bhishma smiled.  "My dear Yudhishthira," he said, "it's marrying off your daughter! But you must choose the right husband for her."

"How do I choose the right husband?" Yudhishthira asked.

Bhishma explained, "You need to find out if he's a good person.  Is he kind? Is he smart?  Does he come from a good family? Does he do good things?"

Bhishma then told Yudhishthira about different ways to get married:

* **Brahma Marriage:** The father finds a good husband and gives his daughter away with gifts.  This is the best way.
* **Kshatriya Marriage:**  Like the Brahma marriage, but it's how kings and warriors do it.
* **Gandharva Marriage:** The girl and boy fall in love and get married without their parents' help. This is also good.
* **Asura Marriage:** The boy pays a lot of money to the girl's family. This is not very nice.
* **Rakshasa Marriage:**  The boy takes the girl by force! This is the worst way.

Bhishma said, "The Brahma, Kshatriya, and Gandharva marriages are good.  The Asura and Rakshasa marriages are bad."

He also talked about how many wives a man could have.  Brahmins could have three, Kshatriyas two, and Vaisyas only one from their own group.  He said it was wrong to marry someone from a lower group.

Bhishma explained that a man of thirty should marry a ten-year-old girl, or a twenty-one-year-old man could marry a seven-year-old girl.  A girl without a father or brother shouldn't be married off too young. If she's not married by the time she becomes a young woman, she can choose her own husband after three years of waiting.

Yudhishthira then asked about what happens when a girl's family accepts gifts (a dowry) from one man, then decides to give her to someone else.

Bhishma said, "The gifts don't make her a wife.  The real wedding is when the husband takes her hand in a proper ceremony. That's what truly makes them husband and wife."

Bhishma told a story about how his uncle, King Valhika, had taught him the importance of a proper wedding ceremony.  The gifts or dowry aren't what make a marriage real; it's the ceremony and the couple's love and commitment to each other.  Even if a man gives a dowry, then dies, the family can choose a better husband for their daughter.  The important thing is that the marriage happens the right way.  The father has the right to choose the best husband for his daughter, even if he's already received a dowry from someone else.  It is the wedding ceremony that truly unites a couple in marriage.
