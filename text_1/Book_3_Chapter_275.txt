Once upon a time, there was a great king named Dasaratha. He had four amazing sons: Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, and Shatrughna.  Rama was the oldest and everyone loved him. He was strong, brave, and very smart.

King Dasaratha was getting old. He wanted to make Rama the king. All his wise advisors agreed.  Rama was perfect! He was handsome, strong, and kind. Everyone loved him.

But, a mean maid named Manthara told Kaikeyi, Dasaratha's second wife, that Rama would be king, not her son Bharata. Kaikeyi got very angry.  She reminded the king of a promise he made her a long time ago.  She demanded two things: that Bharata become king, and that Rama go live in the forest for fourteen years.

King Dasaratha was heartbroken, but he kept his promise.  Rama, even though he was sad, agreed to go to the forest to keep his father's word.  His brother Lakshmana and his beautiful wife Sita went with him.  King Dasaratha was so sad that he died soon after.

Bharata, when he learned what happened, was very upset. He didn't want to be king. He went to find Rama to bring him back, but Rama decided to stay in the forest.

While in the forest, Rama and Lakshmana protected everyone from the mean Rakshasas (monsters).  One mean Rakshasa, Surpanakha, tried to hurt Sita. Rama and Lakshmana fought many Rakshasas, even killing their leader, Khara.

Surpanakha ran to her brother, Ravana, a ten-headed monster king. She told him all about Rama.  Ravana was very angry and decided to kidnap Sita! That's how Rama's adventure in the forest really began...
