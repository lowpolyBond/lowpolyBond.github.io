Once upon a time, a great god named Maheswara talked to everyone.  He said, "You've all told me about your good deeds. Now listen to this!  There are special, secret things about being good and doing what's right.  Only people who are really good and believe in God should listen to these secrets.

These secrets are about doing amazing things!  If you give cows food every day for a whole month, and you only eat one meal a day yourself, you'll earn great rewards! Cows are super special. They’re like magical creatures that help hold up the whole world – the gods, the bad guys, and even us humans! Helping cows is like doing something incredibly good.

Giving cows food every day makes you a better person, every day!  A long, long time ago, I said cows were really important.  Even the great god Brahman asked me to be kind to them! That's why you often see a bull on my flag – it shows how much I love cows! I play with cows all the time!  So, everyone should be kind to cows.

Cows are very powerful. They can even grant wishes! If you give a cow food, even just for one day, you get a HUGE reward! It's like getting a quarter of all the good things you ever do in your whole life!"
