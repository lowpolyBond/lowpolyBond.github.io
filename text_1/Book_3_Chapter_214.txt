Once upon a time, a wise man was traveling to learn about religion.  A kind bird-catcher helped him.

The bird-catcher said, “A woman told you to come to me. I know a lot about religion.”

The wise man said, “You’re very good. I believe everything she said about you.”

The bird-catcher said, “That woman was right. But first, you need to go home. Your parents are very sad because you left without asking.”

“Your parents are blind from crying because they miss you,” the bird-catcher explained. “Being good and wise doesn’t matter if you’re hurting your family. Go home and make them happy!”

The wise man said, “You are right. Thank you.”

The bird-catcher said, “You are very good and wise, like a holy person!  But there's nothing better than making your parents happy.”

The wise man was so grateful. He said, “It's so hard to find someone as wise as you. You saved me!  You’re like the grandsons who saved King Yayati. I want to know your secret. Why are you a bird-catcher?”

The bird-catcher said, “I used to be a wise man like you, but I did a bad thing. I was hunting with a king. I thought I shot a deer, but it was a holy man!  He was hurt really badly. I was so sorry, but he was angry. He said, ‘You will become a bird-catcher!’ And that’s what happened.”
