King Dhritarashtra was sad. He didn't like the gambling game, but he felt like he couldn't stop it.  Bhishma, Drona, Vidura, and even his wife Gandhari didn't like it either.  Dhritarashtra knew it was wrong, but he couldn't make his bad son, Duryodhana, stop.

Wise Vyasa said, "King, you're right.  A son is very precious."  Vyasa told a story about Indra, the king of the gods, and Suravi, the mother of cows.

Suravi was crying. Indra asked why.  Suravi said, "My son is being hurt by a farmer! He's too weak to carry his load.  I feel so sad." Indra was surprised.  Suravi said, "I have many sons, but I feel the most sorry for the weak ones."

Indra was amazed. He learned that a son is more important than anything else. He helped Suravi's son.

Vyasa said to Dhritarashtra, "Just like Suravi loved all her sons, you should love all yours, especially the weak ones. Your son Pandu only has five sons, and they are very sad. They are in danger!"

Vyasa said, "You have so many sons, but Pandu's sons are in trouble.  If you want all your sons to be safe, make Duryodhana be friends with the Pandavas again!"
