Long ago, a wise man named Parasara told a king a story.  He said that everyone had a good way to earn money.  Brahmins (priests) got gifts.  Kshatriyas (warriors) won in battles.  Vaishyas (farmers and traders) worked hard at their jobs.  Shudras (workers) served the others.  Even a little honest work was good.  Spending that money on good things made them even better people.

Parasara explained that if a Brahmin needed to, they could do the work of a warrior or farmer, but never a Shudra's work. If a Shudra couldn't find work, they could trade, raise animals, or do crafts.  But things like acting, selling alcohol or meat, or working with iron or leather were not good jobs.  If someone did those jobs, and then stopped, they could become a better person.

He said that a long time ago, people were good. They were honest and kind.  If someone did something wrong, everyone would just say, "Shame on you!" That was enough. But then, bad spirits called Asuras came and lived inside people.  These spirits were like Greed, Anger, and Lust.  They made people proud and mean.  People fought and cheated to get rich. Just saying "Shame on you!" wasn't enough anymore.

The good gods went to the great god Shiva for help. Shiva used his magic arrow to defeat the bad spirits.  People became good again, and studied holy books.  Wise people ruled the land.

But some people still did bad things.  Parasara told the king to be a good Kshatriya.  He should be kind to everyone, and always try to be good. He told him to be brave, kind to friends, and love his family.

He said that good times and bad times come in life, but always do good. Even if you are poor or rich, be kind to everyone and try to learn. Think of everyone as your family. Don't hurt anyone. If you stop wanting bad things, and let kindness fill your heart, you will be truly happy.
