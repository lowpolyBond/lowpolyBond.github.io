Once upon a time, near where the river Ganga met the land, lived a very wise and holy man named Bharadwaja. He was very, very good at praying and doing hard things to please the gods.  One day, while bathing in the river, he saw a beautiful water nymph named Ghritachi.  A gust of wind blew, and she lost her clothes!  Bharadwaja felt a strong desire, and even though he was very holy, some of his special body fluid came out. He carefully put it in a pot.  Amazingly, a baby boy grew from it! They named him Drona, which means "the pot-born."

Drona grew up to be very smart. He learned everything about the holy books and became a great warrior.  Bharadwaja had a friend, King Prishata, who also had a son named Drupada. Drona and Drupada were best friends as children.  Later, when Drupada became king, Drona heard that a great warrior named Rama was giving away all his things.  Drona went to Rama and asked for his weapons. Rama gave Drona all his weapons, including a super-powerful one called the Brahma weapon!

Drona became very strong. He went to see his old friend Drupada, the king, but Drupada was mean!  He said, "You're not good enough to be my friend!" This made Drona very sad.  To get back at Drupada, Drona went to the Kuru kings.  He became a teacher to their grandsons, including the famous Arjuna.  He taught them how to fight really well.

Then, Drona told his students, "My payment for teaching you is to defeat King Drupada and give me his kingdom!"  Arjuna and the other Pandavas were amazing warriors, so they fought Drupada and won! They brought Drupada to Drona.  Drona then said, "Okay, let's be friends again. We'll share the kingdom. You rule the south, and I'll rule the north."  Drupada agreed, but even though they were friends now, Drupada was still really upset about being defeated. He never forgot how Drona had humiliated him.  He felt very, very sad.
