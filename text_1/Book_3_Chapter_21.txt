Once upon a time, Krishna was fighting a very bad king named Salwa.  Salwa flew up into the sky and threw lots of weapons at Krishna – big maces, spears, and heavy clubs!  Krishna was super fast. He shot arrows and sliced all the weapons in half before they hit him.  Whoosh! Bang!  It was a noisy battle!

Salwa then threw many arrows at Krishna’s chariot and his friend Daruka, who was driving.  Daruka was hurt badly.  Arrows stuck all over him – his chest, head, arms – everywhere! He cried out, "I'm too hurt to drive!"  Poor Daruka looked like a red mountain after a rainstorm, he was bleeding so much. Krishna felt sad but told Daruka to be brave.

Just then, someone rushed up to Krishna’s chariot. He had a very sad message from Ahuka, Krishna’s friend.  "Salwa attacked Dwaraka and… killed Krishna’s father, Vasudeva!" the messenger cried. "You should go home and protect Dwaraka, Krishna!"

Krishna’s heart sank. He felt terrible. He wondered if his other friends, Baladeva, Satyaki, and Pradyumna were okay too. He had left them to protect Dwaraka.  He thought, “If my friends are dead, then even a super-strong god couldn’t have saved my father!"

Suddenly, Krishna saw his father, Vasudeva, falling from the chariot!  Krishna was so shocked he fainted! When he woke up, he couldn’t see his father, his chariot, or even Salwa! He thought it must have been a bad dream. Then he grabbed his bow and started shooting arrows again, hundreds of them!
