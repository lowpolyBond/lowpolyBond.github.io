Once upon a time, after a long talk, the wise Bhishma fell silent.  Yudhishthira, the king, and his brothers went home.

Yudhishthira asked his brothers and Vidura, "Life is all about Goodness, Wealth, and Pleasure.  Which is most important? Which is next? Which is least important?  And which should we focus on to be good people?"

Vidura, who was very clever, answered first. He said, "Goodness is the most important!  It comes from studying holy books, being kind, giving to others, being honest, and controlling yourself.  Goodness is what helped holy people overcome problems. It's what keeps the world going. Even the gods are good.  Wealth is next, and Pleasure is last. Focus on Goodness!"

Next, Arjuna, a very brave warrior, spoke. He said, "The world is a place to work! Farming, trading, and all kinds of jobs bring Wealth.  We need Wealth to be good and have Pleasure. Even people who aren't very good can be good if they have Wealth! Wealth is like the foundation, Goodness and Pleasure are built on it.”

Then Nakula and Sahadeva, twins, said, "Work hard to get Wealth!  Good Wealth, earned honestly, brings Pleasure. But you need Goodness too.  Without Goodness, Wealth is no good. Without Wealth, you can't enjoy Pleasure."

Bhima, the strong one, had a different idea. He said, "Pleasure is most important!  Everyone wants things. Even holy people want to be good!  Desire makes people work hard.  It makes farmers farm, traders trade, and everyone do their jobs. Desire is the start of everything, even Goodness and Wealth!"

Yudhishthira listened to everyone.  He said, "You're all smart, but I think differently. The best thing is to be free of wanting things.  Don't worry about what's good or bad, rich or poor, happy or sad.  Just be free!"

Everyone was happy to hear Yudhishthira’s wise words and praised him for his insightful thoughts. They all bowed to their great king, and the story continued.
