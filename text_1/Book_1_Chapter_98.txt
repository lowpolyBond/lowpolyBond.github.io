King Santanu saw a beautiful woman.  He fell in love! He asked her to marry him.

The woman said, "Yes, I will marry you. But you must promise me something. You canâ€™t tell me what to do, and you must always be kind."  The king promised.

They got married, and lived happily.  The queen was very beautiful and kind.  She was amazing! They had eight babies! But every time a baby was born, the queen put it in the river!  The king was sad but he kept his promise. He didn't say anything.

When the eighth baby was born, the king couldn't take it anymore. "Please don't do this!" he cried. "Who are you? Why are you doing this?"

The queen smiled. "I am Ganga, the river goddess!" she said. "Those babies weren't ordinary children. They were special.  They were eight powerful gods, the Vasus, who were cursed to become humans. They needed a good king to be their father, and me, a goddess, to be their mother.  I kept my promise to them. Now, they are free from the curse.  This last baby is yours.  Keep him safe."  She kissed the baby goodbye, and disappeared back into the river. The king named his son Gangadatta.
