Once upon a time, two sisters, Kadru and Vinata, made a bet.  The winner would be a servant to the loser!  The next morning, the sun peeked over the horizon.  Kadru and Vinata hurried off to see a magical flying horse.

On their way, they saw the ocean!  It was HUGE! Bigger than anything they'd ever seen.  It was so deep, filled with giant fish, scary sea monsters, and sparkly treasures.  The ocean was the home of Varuna, the water god, and lots of other magical creatures.  It was so big and deep that even the wisest person couldn't figure out how deep it really was!

The ocean was always moving.  The waves danced and crashed.  It roared with the sounds of whales and other amazing creatures.  It was so big, it looked like it went on forever!  The sisters were amazed.  They had never seen anything so incredible.  It even had sparkling gems hidden inside!  

After seeing the amazing ocean, Kadru and Vinata continued their journey to see the magical horse. What would happen next?
