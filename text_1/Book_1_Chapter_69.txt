King Dushmanta, a brave warrior, went hunting in a big forest. He took many soldiers, horses, and elephants with him.  The forest was noisy! You could hear shouting soldiers, elephants trumpeting, horses neighing, and drums beating.  People watched from their houses, saying, "He's strong like a god!" They threw flowers at him.

The forest was huge and full of trees and animals â€“ deer, lions, tigers!  King Dushmanta and his soldiers hunted.  He shot arrows at tigers and swung his sword at others. He was a really good hunter!  He even used a big club!

The forest became very noisy as the king and his soldiers hunted.  The lions ran away, scared.  Other animals ran too, crying out in fear.  Some animals fell down, tired and thirsty because there was no water.  Sadly, some animals were eaten by the hungry soldiers.  Even big, strong elephants ran away, scared and hurt.  They ran over some soldiers by accident.

Soon, the forest was quiet.  King Dushmanta and his soldiers had scared away most of the animals.  The forest, once full of life, was much quieter now.
