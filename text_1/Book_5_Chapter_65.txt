King Dhritarashtra talked to his son, Duryodhana.  "My dear son," he said, "you're making a big mistake! You want to fight the Pandava brothers.  They're super strong, like the five elements of the earth, air, fire, water, and sky!

You can't win against Yudhishthira, the oldest Pandava brother. He's the fairest and most honest person. And Bhima? He's incredibly strong, as strong as the god of death!  Arjuna is the greatest archer ever! He's like Mount Meru, the tallest mountain!

Dhrishtadyumna is a great warrior too, he’s like the king of the gods throwing thunderbolts!  Satyaki is another powerful warrior, always fighting for the Pandavas. And then there's Krishna.  He's the strongest of them all!  He's incredibly powerful!  He's more powerful than everyone and everything in the whole world!

Remember what happened at Virata’s kingdom?  Arjuna, all by himself, defeated your whole army!  If one Pandava brother is so strong, imagine how powerful they are together!

Please, my son, listen to your elders.  Listen to Bhishma, Drona, Kripa, Vikarna and Vahlika. They love you as much as I do. They’re wise. Make peace with your cousins, the Pandavas. Share the kingdom with them. Be brothers."
