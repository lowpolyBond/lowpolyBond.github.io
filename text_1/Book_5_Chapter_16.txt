Long ago, the gods needed help.  Agni, the god of fire, was very important. He was like the gods' mouth, carrying their offerings.  He saw everything, even the secrets inside everyone's heart.  He was so powerful that without him, the whole world would disappear!

Vrihaspati, a wise teacher, told Agni how special he was. He said Agni was the best offering, and even the creator and destroyer of the worlds! He asked Agni to help find Indra, the king of the gods, who was hiding.

Agni, like a brave explorer, dove into the water. He searched and searched until he found Indra hiding tiny and small inside a lotus flower.  He told Vrihaspati right away.

Vrihaspati and all the other gods went to find Indra. They praised him for all the bad guys he'd defeated before, like Namuchi, Samvara, and Vritra. They cheered him up, and Indra grew stronger and bigger.

Then Vrihaspati explained a big problem: a human king named Nahusha had taken over heaven! He was super strong and mean, and everyone was scared.  He made even the gods do his work!

Indra asked, "How did Nahusha become so powerful?"  Vrihaspati explained that the gods, scared that Indra had given up being king, had asked Nahusha to rule.  They gave him their power, and he became incredibly strong and mean.

Kuvera, Yama, and Varuna – other important gods – came to help Indra fight Nahusha.  Even Agni offered to help!  Indra promised to share the offerings from sacrifices with them all if they helped defeat Nahusha.

After they beat Nahusha, Indra rewarded his friends. He gave Kuvera control over all the treasures, Yama control over the ancestors, and Varuna control over the water.  Everyone was happy, and Indra was once again the strong and powerful king of the gods!
