After a big battle, Drona, a super-strong warrior, got his army ready for another fight.  Lots of noise! Soldiers yelled angrily, wanting to fight.  Some stretched their bows, others got ready their swords – shiny, sharp swords as blue as the sky!  They shouted, "Where's Arjuna? Where's Bhima?"  Lots of soldiers swung their clubs and maces, asking for the Pandava brothers.

Drona blew his horn, and his army rushed into position.  He told Jayadratha, a powerful prince, "You, Karna, Aswatthaman, Salya, Vrishasena, and Kripa, with tons of soldiers, elephants, and chariots, stand behind me, far away.  Even the gods couldn't attack you there!" Jayadratha felt much safer.  He went to his spot with his army, all ready to fight.  His horses wore fancy gold decorations.

Durmarshana, Jayadratha's son, led a huge group of angry elephants.  Duhsasana and Vikarna, Jayadratha's allies, were in the front lines. Drona's army was HUGE – forty-eight miles long! It was shaped like a circle and a cart.  In the middle was another circle, and then a tiny pointed part in the center – like a needle!  Kritavarman, a great archer, stood at the point. Next to him were other powerful kings, then Duryodhana and Karna.  Behind them were many, many soldiers.  King Jayadratha was at the side, guarded by tons of soldiers. Drona himself was in the middle, ready to fight. He looked so strong and powerful in his white armor, like a god of destruction!

The Kauravas cheered when they saw Drona’s amazing army!  It looked so big and scary, like a stormy ocean.  Everyone thought this army was so powerful it could swallow the whole world!  Duryodhana was thrilled; he knew his army was ready to win!
