Once upon a time, after a big battle, the great warrior Bhishma was lying hurt.  All the kings went home. Then, Karna, a strong warrior, arrived. He was scared and sad.  He saw Bhishma lying on a bed of reeds.  Tears welled up in Karna’s eyes. He fell at Bhishma's feet.

Karna said, "Great Bhishma, I am Karna, Radha's son. You always hated me!"

Bhishma, old and tired, opened his eyes. He sent away the guards.  Then, he hugged Karna like a father hugging his son!

Bhishma said, "Karna, you are my rival, but I'm glad you came. You are Kunti's son, not Radha's!  Narada and Vyasa told me the truth. I never truly hated you. I only spoke harshly to weaken you. You are a great warrior, generous, and brave, even better than many gods! I was afraid of fights between us, so I was mean. You're as strong as Arjuna, Krishna's brother! You even defeated Jarasandha, a very powerful king! Your brothers are the Pandavas, the sons of Pandu!"  Bhishma told Karna to join the Pandavas.

Karna said, "I know the truth, Bhishma. I am Kunti’s son, but I grew up with a chariot driver.  I've been loyal to Duryodhana. I would give up everything for him – my family, my wealth, even my life! A warrior doesn't die of sickness!  My fate is to fight the Pandavas. I can't stop this fight.  I will fight Arjuna!"

Bhishma said, "If you can't stop fighting, then fight bravely, Karna. Fight without anger.  Do what's right.  I give you my blessing.  Through fighting Arjuna, you will achieve greatness."

Then, Karna bowed to Bhishma, thanked him, and went to join the battle.  The end.
