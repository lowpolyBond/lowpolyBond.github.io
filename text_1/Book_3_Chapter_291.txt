King Yudhishthira was very sad.  He wasn't just sad about losing his kingdom in a game. He was mostly sad about Draupadi, his wife.  She was taken away by the bad guy, Jayadratha.  Yudhishthira asked the wise Markandeya, "Have you ever heard of a woman as good and strong as Draupadi?"

Markandeya said, "Yes, I know of Savitri.  Long ago, there was a very good king named Aswapati. He was kind, honest, and loved helping others.  He wanted a child very badly, so he prayed and prayed. He was very good and did everything right for many years."

Aswapati prayed to the goddess Savitri.  After many years of being good and praying, Savitri appeared!  She was very happy with Aswapati. She offered him a gift.  Aswapati asked for a child. Savitri said, "You will have a very strong daughter."

Savitri was born. She was very beautiful and kind. Everyone loved her. But no one asked for her hand in marriage.  King Aswapati was sad. He told Savitri, "My dear daughter, it's time for you to find a husband.  Choose wisely!"

Savitri was brave.  She didn't wait for princes to come to her. She got in her golden chariot and went to find a husband herself!  She went to visit many holy places and helped many people.  She was a wonderful princess, kind and brave.  She showed that even a princess can find her own way!
