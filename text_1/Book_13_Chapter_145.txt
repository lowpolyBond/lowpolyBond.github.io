Once upon a time, Goddess Uma asked Lord Shiva, "How can someone go to Heaven?"

Shiva smiled.  "It's simple!  Someone who is kind and shares their things with others goes to Heaven.  They give food, clothes, and shelter to the poor and sick. They dig wells for thirsty travelers and build places for everyone to rest. They always give happily, sharing everything they have – even their houses and animals!  They live happily in Heaven for a long, long time, playing with beautiful fairies.  Then, when their good deeds are used up, they are reborn into a rich and happy family on Earth."

"But what about people who *don't* share?" Uma asked.

"Those who are selfish and only think of themselves go to a sad place called Hell," Shiva explained. "They don't help others, even when asked.  When they leave Hell, they are reborn into poor families, always hungry and unhappy."  Some people are even proud and rude, refusing to help others. They also go to Hell and are reborn into very unhappy lives.

Uma asked another question.  "Some people are very smart, others aren't.  Some are born blind or sick. Why?"

Shiva answered, "People who always ask wise questions and do good things become very smart and happy.  But people who do bad things, like looking at others' wives or doing bad things to animals, might be born blind or sick." He explained that those who were unkind or did bad things to others were often reborn with difficulties.

Uma asked, "What are good and bad things to do?"

Shiva said, "If you want to go to Heaven, always ask wise people for advice and do what is right.  If you do this, you will be reborn into a good family, smart and happy, with many good things."

Uma asked about people who don't care about being good.  Some are very good, always keeping their promises and doing good things. Some are very bad, like mean monsters! Why is that?

Shiva said, "It’s what they do! People who follow good rules and do good things are kind and helpful. Those who are bad and ignore the rules end up mean and unhappy."


And so, Shiva explained to Uma how people's actions determined their lives, both in this world and the next.  He taught her that kindness and good deeds lead to happiness, while selfishness and cruelty lead to unhappiness.
