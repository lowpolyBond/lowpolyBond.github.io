King Marutta wanted a special ceremony.  He asked a wise priest, Samvarta, to help.  Samvarta asked, "Who told you about me?"

Marutta said, "The wise Narada told me you were the best priest!" Narada was a very famous traveler.  Samvarta was happy.  But then, he acted strange!

Samvarta said, "I have a problem! My brother works for Indra, the king of the gods.  My brother took all my things! I can't help you unless I get permission from my brother first."

Marutta tried to get permission from Indra's priest, Vrihaspati, but Vrihaspati said, "No! Indra doesn't want Marutta to be powerful!"

Marutta was sad. He went back to Samvarta.  Samvarta said, "I *can* help you, but Indra and my brother will be angry.  Are you sure?"

Marutta promised, "I will always be loyal to you! If I ever break my promise, may I never go to heaven!"

Samvarta said, "Okay! I will help you! We will make you even stronger than Indra! I donâ€™t want gifts; I just want to make Indra angry!"  And so he helped Marutta.
