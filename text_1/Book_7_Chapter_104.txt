King Dhritarashtra asked his advisor Sanjaya, "Sanjaya, tell me about the amazing flags on the chariots of our warriors and the Pandavas!"

Sanjaya said, "King, the flags were beautiful!  They shone like bright flames of fire. Some were made of gold, others were decorated with gold. They were tall and majestic, like the golden Mountain Meru!  Each flag had lots of colorful banners fluttering around it.  The banners danced in the wind like pretty ladies at a party. They looked like rainbows!"

Arjuna's flag had a fierce monkey on it. It was very scary to the enemy! Drona's son had a flag with a lion's tail, shining like the sun. Karna's flag had a golden elephant rope, and it seemed to fill the whole sky!  His banner danced in the wind. Kripa had a strong bull on his flag. Vrishasenaâ€™s flag had a beautiful golden peacock that seemed to sing. Salya had a flag with a corn goddess. The king of the Sindhus had a silver boar on his flag, shining like a crystal. Somadatta's son had a golden post from a special ceremony.  Duryodhana's flag showed a jeweled elephant, with lots of bells that jingled.

Sanjaya said, "King, there were nine amazing flags on your side, and then Arjuna's tenth flag, with the big monkey.  Arjuna's flag made him look as grand as a mountain on fire!  Then, the battle began! The warriors aimed their bows at Arjuna, and Arjuna shot his arrows back!  Arjuna fought all the warriors by himself! He was so brave! It was a huge battle, with many brave warriors, horses, and elephants fighting on both sides!"
