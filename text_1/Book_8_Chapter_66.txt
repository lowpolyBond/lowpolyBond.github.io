King Yudhishthira was so happy to see Arjuna and Krishna!  "You defeated Karna!" he exclaimed.  "That was amazing! Karna was a super strong warrior! He was like a poisonous snake, very dangerous! He was protected by his friends Vrishasena and Sushena, who were also great fighters. He was taught by the best teacher, Rama! He was almost unbeatable! He was the strongest warrior for the Kauravas, always helping Duryodhana. He even scared me! For thirteen years, I was scared of him! I couldn't sleep at night! I always thought about him. I even felt like a scared bird flying away from him!  He even made fun of me in battle! He took my chariot, and my friends had to save me! I was so ashamed!  But you defeated him! Tell me how you did it!"

Yudhishthira continued, "Karna was as strong as the gods!  He was a great warrior, the best archer, everyone admired him.  Dhritarashtra and Duryodhana loved him. They thought Karna would kill you, Arjuna!  How did you beat someone so powerful? Did you cut off his head? I've never been so scared as I was with Karna!  Please tell me everything!" Yudhishthira was so relieved and happy that Karna was defeated. He felt like he had been waiting forever for this good news.  He was like someone waiting for great news, just as Vishnu waited to hear that Vritra was defeated.
