The battlefield was a terrible sight.  Lots of soldiers, elephants, and chariots were broken and scattered.  Many kings were dead.  It looked scary, like a monster's playground!

King Duryodhana's army was very upset.  They didn't know what to do.  Then, a wise old warrior named Kripa came to Duryodhana.

"Duryodhana," Kripa said sadly, "look at what's happened.  Bhishma, Drona, Karna, and many others are gone.  Even your son Lakshmana is dead.  What can we do now?"

Kripa explained that warriors fight bravely, even against family.  If they die in battle, it's honorable.  But running away is shameful.  A warrior's life is hard.

"Arjuna is too strong," Kripa said.  "He's like a powerful fire that burns everything.  He has a great bow and amazing horses.  With Krishna helping him, he's unbeatable.  The Pandavas’ army is much stronger than ours now."

Kripa described Arjuna's power.  His bow was like lightning. His horses were fast and strong.  Arjuna was brave and skillful.  He had won many battles, even when the Kaurava army was much bigger.

Kripa told Duryodhana, "Your army is broken and scattered.  We’ve lost many important leaders.  It's time to make peace.  Yudhishthira, the Pandava king, is kind.  He’ll probably let you live if you ask.  Krishna will help you."

Kripa begged Duryodhana to give up.  He said that making peace was the only smart thing to do. He didn’t want Duryodhana to die.  He said these things with a heavy heart, and even cried a little.  He was a very old man, and he was worried for Duryodhana.
