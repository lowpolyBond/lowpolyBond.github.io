Once upon a time, after a big war, King Dhritarashtra felt very sad.  He had lost his sons.  He and his wife, Gandhari, wanted to leave the kingdom and live quietly in the forest.

Dhritarashtra asked his people if they would let him go. He was old and heartbroken. He explained that he’d gotten permission from his father and King Yudhishthira, the new king.  He bowed his head and asked for their blessing.

The people of the kingdom were very sad too. They cried. They loved Dhritarashtra and his son, Duryodhana. They felt like they had lost part of themselves. After a while, they calmed down. They chose a wise Brahmin named Samba to speak for them.

Samba told Dhritarashtra, "King, what you say is true.  You and your son, Duryodhana, were good rulers.  You ruled us well.  But the war wasn't Duryodhana's fault, nor yours.  It was fate.  Many brave warriors from both sides died—Bhishma, Drona, Karna, Arjuna, Bhima, and so many more. It was destiny."

Samba continued, "King Yudhishthira is a good and kind king. He's just like the great kings before him. He will rule us fairly, just like you and your father before him.  We will be safe under his rule.  Please go to the forest with your wife, and know that you and your son will always be remembered."

Everyone agreed with Samba. They said, "That's wonderful! We agree!" Dhritarashtra thanked them, and he and Gandhari went home. That night, they made plans for their peaceful life in the forest.
