Once upon a time, a king lost his kingdom.  A wise man said, "King, don't give up!  I have a plan to help you get it back. Listen carefully!"

The king said, "Please, tell me your plan! I'll do anything you say."

The wise man said, "Be humble. Forget your anger and pride.  Go serve King Janaka. Be kind and honest. King Janaka is a good man. He'll give you lots of help and make you his trusted friend."

"With King Janaka's help," the wise man continued, "you'll make many new friends.  Then, you can outsmart your enemies. You can trick them into fighting each other!  Or, you can become friends with *their* enemies!"

"You can also give your enemies lots of expensive things—beautiful clothes, fancy houses, yummy food.  Make them spend all their money!  Pretend to be their friend, like a friendly dog or a clever crow.  Make them do hard work for you.  Give them gifts to give away—that will make them poor!"

"Get your enemies to give away their money on big religious ceremonies. This will make them poor.  Tell them that their best people are being treated badly – then send a holy man to convince them to give up everything and go live in the forest!"

"Finally," the wise man whispered, "you can use secret potions to weaken their army.  There are many ways to trick your enemies!"

The king listened carefully. He knew that with cleverness and a little bit of trickery, he could win back his kingdom.
