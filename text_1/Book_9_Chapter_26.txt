Once, in a big battle, Bhima, a very strong warrior, was fighting for the Pandavas.  He was so strong he smashed lots of enemy elephants!  Many of the King's soldiers were dying.

The King's sons saw Bhima fighting.  They were brave warriors too, but not as strong as Bhima.  Their names were Durmarshana, Srutanta, Jaitra, Bhurivala, Ravi, Jayatsena, Sujata, Durvishaha, Durvimochana, Dushpradharsha, and Srutarvan.  They all attacked Bhima together!

Bhima was clever. He jumped back into his chariot and started shooting arrows.  He was very, very good with his bow and arrow!  He shot Durmarshana, then Srutanta, then Jayatsena.  They all fell from their chariots.

Srutarvan, angry at seeing his brothers fall, shot many arrows at Bhima!  But Bhima was even stronger and he shot Jaitra, Ravi, and Bhurivala. Then, he shot Durvimochana and Dushpradharsha and Sujata. Finally he hit Durvishaha.

Srutarvan was furious that his brothers were dead. He shot Bhima’s bow to pieces!  But Bhima grabbed a new bow and shot Srutarvan with so many arrows that Srutarvan had to stop fighting. They fought like super heroes.  Bhima was so strong that he even killed Srutarvan’s horses and driver!

Now Srutarvan had no chariot and had to fight with just a sword and shield.  But Bhima was too quick and shot Srutarvan's head off!

The King’s army was scared now! They saw Bhima had killed so many of their best fighters. Bhima was so strong, he even killed hundreds of elephants, thousands of soldiers, and lots of horses!  He was amazing!

The King's army was very sad and scared. They had lost so many friends. They knew they couldn't win against such a powerful warrior.
