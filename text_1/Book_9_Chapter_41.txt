Once upon a time, a very powerful holy man named Dalvya Vaka lived in a quiet place where everyone chanted prayers.  King Dhritarashtra was not very nice.  He was mean to some holy men who asked for some of his cows. He even gave them dead cows!

Dalvya Vaka was very angry. He wanted to teach the king a lesson.  He took the dead cows, cut up the meat, and made a special fire.  He used the meat in a special ceremony, like a magic spell, to make the king’s kingdom get weaker and weaker.

Slowly, bad things started happening in Dhritarashtra’s kingdom.  Everything went wrong! The king was very sad. He asked his advisors what to do.  They told him, “The holy man is angry because of the dead cows!”

The king quickly went to find Dalvya Vaka. He was very sorry. He bowed down and begged for forgiveness.  “Please forgive me!” he cried.  “I was foolish and mean.”

Dalvya Vaka saw how truly sorry the king was. He felt compassion. He stopped the magic spell!  The kingdom started to get better.  The king was happy again, and he gave many gifts to the holy men.

A long time ago, another very important person used a similar magic with a fire ceremony. It was Brihaspati. He used meat to make the bad guys, the Asuras, go away.

Another great king, Yayati, had a wonderful ceremony by the Sarasvati River.  The river was so happy with him that it magically gave everyone everything they wished for!  It was amazing!

Finally, a kind and generous prince named Baladeva also visited a special river. He was known for being very good and giving away lots of things.


That’s the story of how a holy man used his powers to teach a king a lesson, and how kindness and apologies can change everything!
