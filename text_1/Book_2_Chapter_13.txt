King Dasaratha was very sad. He felt terrible, like he’d fallen from the sky.  His wife, Queen Kaikeyi, was mean. She hadn’t gotten what she wanted, and she wasn't happy. She yelled at the king again, "You always say you keep your promises! Why won't you give me what you promised?"

King Dasaratha was upset. He said, "After I die, you can do what you want. But sending Rama away will be a lie!  I waited a long time for a son, and Rama is so good and brave! How can I send him away? He's kind and smart, with eyes like beautiful lotuses. He shouldn't go to the dark Dandaka forest! It would break my heart to see him sad.  I'd rather die happy than see my wonderful Rama suffer!"

The king was so sad that he didn't even like looking at the moon.  He wished the night would never end. He begged the night to stay, saying, "Please don't let the sun come up! I don't want to see Kaikeyi's mean face again!"

Then King Dasaratha tried to convince Kaikeyi to change her mind. "Please, I'm old and don't have much time left. I've already said Rama will be king! Let him rule and everyone will be happy. You'll be famous!"

The kind king cried, but Kaikeyi didn't care.  She didn’t listen.  King Dasaratha knew he couldn't stop her.  He fainted and fell to the ground. He spent the whole night crying.

When morning came, the musicians wanted to wake the king with music. But King Dasaratha told them to be quiet. He was too heartbroken.
