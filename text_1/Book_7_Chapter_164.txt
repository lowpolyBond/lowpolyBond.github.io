It was a dark and scary night during the great Kurukshetra war.  Many soldiers were dying.  King Yudhishthira, the Pandavas' leader, told his army, "Attack Drona!  Kill Drona!"

So, the Pandavas' friends, the Panchalas and Somakas, all rushed towards Drona to fight him.  But the Kauravas, the enemy army, fought back hard!

Many amazing battles happened:

* Kritavarman fought Yudhishthira.  They were like two angry elephants fighting!
* Bhuri fought Sahadeva.
* Karna fought Sahadeva too.
* Duryodhana fought Bhima.
* Sakuni fought Nakula.
* Kripa fought Shikhandi.
* Duhshasana fought Prativindhya.
* Ashwatthama fought Ghatotkacha.
* Vrishasena fought Drupada.
* The Madras king fought Virata.
* Chitrasena fought Satanika.
* Alambusha fought Arjuna.
* Dhrishtadyumna fought Drona.

Many other soldiers fought too.  Elephants crashed into each other.  Horses charged, swords clashed, and arrows flew everywhere.  It was a terrible, noisy mess!

Yudhishthira and Kritavarman fought a really tough battle. Yudhishthira shot many arrows at Kritavarman, but Kritavarman broke Yudhishthira's bow and shot him back!  They kept fighting, shooting arrows and breaking weapons.  Finally, Kritavarman even broke Yudhishthira's chariot!  Yudhishthira had to run away.

Kritavarman then went back to protect Drona.  The battle was still raging!
