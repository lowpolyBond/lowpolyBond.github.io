King Yudhishthira asked his grandpa Bhishma, "Grandpa, what should a good king do? How does he keep his kingdom safe and beat his enemies? How does he use secret spies?  How does he make everyone – his people, his family, and his servants – trust him?"

Bhishma smiled. "Yudhishthira, a king must first control himself.  He must be strong inside before he can be strong outside.  How can a king conquer enemies if he can't even control his own anger or greed?  A king must also have secret spies, who look like normal people – maybe silly, or blind, or deaf. These spies must be clever and strong, able to go without food and water for a long time.  He needs spies everywhere – in the cities, in the countryside, even in his own palace! He needs them to watch his friends, his family, everyone. He should even try to find out where the enemies' spies are hiding!"

"If a king finds himself too weak to fight a stronger enemy, he should make peace," Bhishma continued. "Peace is sometimes better than war, even if you are strong.  A wise king makes peace with good, strong people. If danger comes, a king must punish all those who have done wrong. A king shouldn't worry about people who can neither help nor hurt him."

"If a king is strong, he can lead his army to battle," Bhishma said. "He should attack someone who has no friends, or someone who is already fighting someone else, or someone weaker than himself. He should always protect his own city first. A king should never let another king boss him around forever! Even if he's weak, he should try to hurt the stronger king – maybe by using weapons, fire, or poison, or by making the stronger king's advisors fight amongst themselves."

Bhishma explained, "A smart king uses kindness, gifts, or tricks to get what he wants, not always war. He only takes a small amount of money from his people as tax, just enough to protect them.  He needs to treat his people like his own children, but when judging arguments, he must be fair, not just kind. He should put good people in charge of things like mines, taxes, and the army.  He should know the holy books, be wise and kind, and offer prayers. A king must be fair, or he will never get respect in this life or the next.

"If a stronger king attacks, the clever king will run to a safe castle and ask his friends for help. He'll use kindness and tricks to fight back. He might even move people away from roads and farms to protect them. He might even destroy his own food and bridges so the enemy can't use them.  He might even ask his enemy’s enemy for help! He should make his castle strong, with lots of water and traps, and he needs lots of soldiers and weapons ready. He should make sure everyone is safe, and then prepare for battle. He must reward his helpers after every battle.  A king is only truly successful when he defeats or kills his enemies.  A king must take good care of seven things: himself, his advisors, his money, his system of punishment, his friends, his land, and his capital city."

Yudhishthira then asked, "Grandpa, what is important about the way a king rules?"

Bhishma answered, "A good king creates a just and happy kingdom.  When a king is fair and good, and everyone does their jobs, everyone is happy and peaceful. The best kind of rule brings peace and happiness, long life, good crops, and no sadness or illness.  If the king is bad, it's a bad world, and he will be punished in the afterlife."
