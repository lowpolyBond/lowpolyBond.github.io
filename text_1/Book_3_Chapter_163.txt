Once upon a time, the five Pandava brothers – Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva – lived in a beautiful mountain. It was full of tall trees, pretty flowers, and singing birds.  Peacocks and cranes called to each other.  There were sparkling lakes with lotus flowers, and the whole place was so lovely that even Kubera, the king of riches, would have loved it!

The brothers were very happy there.  They practiced their prayers and did good deeds. They missed their brother Arjuna, though, who had gone away to learn to fight.  They thought of him all the time.  The days felt very long.  The mountain was so bright and beautiful, day and night looked the same!

Arjuna had gone to Indra, the king of the gods, to learn amazing fighting skills. He learned to use all sorts of magical weapons! He spent five whole years learning from Indra, and then he said goodbye and headed back to his brothers.  He learned so much! He got weapons from the gods of fire, water, the wind, and many more!

The Pandavas had waited a whole month for Arjuna to return. They were very sad while he was gone, but they knew he was learning to be strong and brave.  When Arjuna finally came back to the mountain, they were so happy to see him again!
