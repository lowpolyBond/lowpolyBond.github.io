The Pandava brothers, five strong princes, went to live in a town called Ekachakra.  They lived simply, like beggars, and everyone loved them. Every night, they gave all their food to their mother, Kunti. She shared it fairly.  Bhima, the strongest brother, always got a bigger share!

One day, the brothers were out begging.  Bhima stayed home with Kunti.  They heard sad crying from the Brahmin’s house next door.  Kunti was a kind woman. She felt very sorry for the Brahmin family.

“We are safe and happy here,” Kunti said to Bhima. “Let’s help them!”

Bhima said, “Let’s find out what’s wrong, Mother, and then we’ll help.”

They heard more crying. Kunti went to the Brahmin’s house.  The Brahmin looked very sad.  He was talking to his wife.

“Life is hard,” he cried.  “We are poor.  I have a son and a daughter.  A bad man wants to take something very precious from us!  If we don’t give it to him, we will all be in terrible danger. But I can’t give it away!  I love my family too much.”

The Brahmin didn't know what to do.  He didn’t want to lose his children.  He was very upset and didn't know how to escape this terrible situation. He was so sad he thought it would be better to die with his family.

Kunti listened to the Brahmin’s sad story.  She knew she had to help him and his family.
