Once upon a time, after a scary snake was gone, King Nala (but he was pretending to be someone else named Vahuka!) went to a new city.  He met King Rituparna.

Nala said, "I'm Vahuka! I'm the best at taking care of horses. I’m great at solving problems and I'm even a super cook! I can do anything difficult. Please, let me work for you!"

King Rituparna said, "Welcome, Vahuka!  I need someone to make my horses super fast. You're hired! You'll be in charge of my stables and get lots of money! You can also live with Varshneya and Jivala – they'll be your friends."

So Nala lived in the city, making friends with Varshneya and Jivala.  Every night, he sadly whispered a poem about a princess he missed, Damayanti.

One night, Jivala asked, "Vahuka, who are you so sad about? Tell me!"

Nala sighed and said, "A silly man, who wasn't very good, left his wonderful wife.  He's so sorry!  He wandered all over, until he found a new home. But he still misses her terribly. She followed him into a scary forest. She's all alone, hungry, and thirsty, and in danger.  That silly man left her there!"

Nala, still pretending to be Vahuka, continued to live in the city, missing Damayanti every day.  He kept his secret, remembering his princess and his mistake.
