Long ago, in the land of Kuru, a wise old man named Bhishma told a king a story about women.  He said that a long, long time ago, the gods were worried because people were becoming too good.  So, the Great God Brahman, who made everything, created women.

Bhishma said that women are like fire – powerful and bright, but also dangerous.  He said they are like a sharp razor, poison, or a snake.  He said that women were made with a special magic, and because of this, they are sometimes tempted to do things that aren't always right.  

Bhishma then told the king about a very good and holy man, Devasarman. Devasarman had a beautiful wife named Ruchi.  Indra, the king of the gods, was very handsome and powerful, and he wanted Ruchi for himself.

Devasarman knew Indra could be tricky, so he asked his best student, Vipula, to protect Ruchi while he went away on a long journey. Indra could change his shape into anything – a handsome prince, a poor beggar, even a bird or an animal!

Vipula was very smart and strong.  He knew he couldn’t just stop Indra with a sword or a wall. Indra could change shape! So, Vipula used special magic. He went *inside* Ruchi’s body!  He was there to protect her, but he didn't touch her. He was like a tiny shadow, unseen and safe.

Vipula stayed inside Ruchi until Devasarman returned from his journey.  He kept Ruchi safe from Indra's tricks.  Bhishma told the king that Vipula showed everyone how even the most powerful magic could be overcome with wisdom and goodness.
