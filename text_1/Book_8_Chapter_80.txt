Once upon a time, in a great battle, Bhima, a strong warrior, was in trouble.  Many enemies surrounded him.  Arjuna, Bhima's brave brother, saw this.  He zoomed towards the enemy, like a superhero!

Arjuna shot arrow after arrow.  Whoosh!  The arrows flew through the air, like a rain of sparkling light.  Many enemy soldiers fell.  The battlefield became messy.  Broken chariots, dead elephants, and fallen warriors were everywhere.  It was a terrible sight!  Arjuna's arrows even knocked down huge elephants, like bowling pins!  His chariot moved easily through the battlefield, like the sun breaking through dark clouds.

Arjuna had cleared the way for Bhima.  He quickly checked on his older brother, Yudhishthira, making sure he was okay.  Then, Arjuna went back to fight.

Ten brave enemy warriors tried to stop Arjuna.  They shot arrows at him, but Arjuna was too quick.  He used his amazing skill and speed to defeat them all. He cut their banners, broke their bows, and even knocked their heads off!

Arjuna was so strong and skillful! He protected his brother and won the battle against the many enemies.
