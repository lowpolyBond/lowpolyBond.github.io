Abhimanyu, a brave warrior, charged into the enemy army!  He was like a storm, shooting arrows everywhere.  He was so strong, no one could stop him!  He defeated many brave soldiers. His arrows flew like deadly snakes, hitting his enemies hard.  He destroyed chariots, horses, and elephants.  Everyone cheered for Abhimanyu, the amazing warrior! He tossed the enemy army around like a big wind blows cotton.

Abhimanyu was like a bright fire, strong and unstoppable.  The enemy soldiers couldn't fight him, they were like tiny bugs against a big flame.  His golden bow shone like lightning. His arrows flew like a swarm of bees.  Nobody could even get close to him! He was so quick and skillful, he defeated even the great warriors Kripa, Drona, and the king of Sindhu.  His bow always looked like a bright circle, like the sun!  People said he was as strong as Arjuna!

The enemy army was all messed up and confused. They cried out in fear, like a stormy sea. Duryodhana, the enemy king, was scared. He called for a powerful demon named Alamvusha.  "Only you can defeat Abhimanyu," he said. "We'll fight Arjuna ourselves."

Alamvusha roared like thunder, scaring the Pandava army. Many soldiers fell to the ground in fear! Alamvusha, angry and ready to fight, attacked the Pandavas.  He was strong and fierce, destroying many soldiers. He fought like a wild animal, and the Pandava army ran away.

Then, Alamvusha fought the five sons of Draupadi.  They fought back bravely, like bright stars against the sun. They attacked him with sharp arrows, piercing his armor.  Alamvusha was hurt, but he got even angrier! He cut off their arrows and bows, and then he shot them with many more arrows. He even killed their horses and drivers.

Arjuna's son, seeing his cousins in trouble, fought Alamvusha. Their battle was huge and scary! It was like a big fire, and everyone watched in amazement. The fight was so fierce, it was like the battle between the gods and demons long ago!
