Once upon a time, two sisters, Kadru and Vinata, flew across the ocean.  They saw a beautiful white horse with a black tail.  Kadru tricked Vinata into a bet about the horse's tail.  Kadru said the tail had more black hairs.  She was right, and poor Vinata lost the bet!  She became Kadru's servant.  She was very sad.

But then, something amazing happened! Vinata's egg hatched!  Out popped Garuda, a HUGE, strong, and bright bird! He shone like a giant ball of fire.  He was so bright that the gods were scared! They thought he was a giant fire, and they hid!

"Oh, no!" they cried. "This fire is going to burn us!"

But Garuda wasn't fire.  He was a powerful and wonderful bird.  The gods were just afraid of his bright light.  When they saw who he really was, the gods were amazed.  They praised him and called him many wonderful things. They said he was as strong as the fire god, Agni, as fast as the wind, and even as powerful as the great god Vishnu.  They begged him not to be angry.

Garuda, hearing their prayers, calmed down. He made his light less bright so the gods wouldn't be so scared. The gods were happy and thanked him.  Garuda, the strong and beautiful bird, had saved the day!  He had made his mother, Vinata, proud.  And thatâ€™s how Garuda showed his great power and kindness.
