Once upon a time, the Pandavas needed to travel to a faraway place called Gandhamadana.  Yudhishthira, their leader, was worried about Draupadi, their mother.  She was very tired.

"Bhima," Yudhishthira said, "your strong son, Ghatotkacha, can carry Draupadi."  Bhima, a very strong warrior, agreed.

"Ghatotkacha," Bhima told his son, "your mother is tired. You're strong, so please carry her."

Ghatotkacha, a mighty Rakshasa (a kind of magical being), said, "I can even carry all the Pandavas and their friends!  Many of my Rakshasa friends will help too!"

So, Ghatotkacha carried Draupadi, and other Rakshasas carried the Pandavas and their friends. They flew through the air!

They saw amazing things:  sparkling mountains, forests full of monkeys and beautiful birds, and rivers sparkling with gems.  They even saw a magical place where good spirits lived.

Finally, they reached a giant jujube tree. It was huge and beautiful, full of sweet fruit.  Wise and holy men lived nearby.

The Pandavas gently stepped off the Rakshasasâ€™ shoulders.  They went to visit the wise men. The wise men welcomed them with open arms, giving them fresh water and flowers.

The Pandavas stayed in that wonderful place, a peaceful forest with a sparkling river.  They spent their time praying, resting, and enjoying the beauty around them. They even saw a beautiful lake and mountain.  Draupadi had a wonderful time, and everyone was happy. They were safe and finally at peace.
