Long ago, a powerful man named Aurva was very, very angry.  He wanted to destroy the whole world!  Why? Because bad kings had hurt his family.  They killed many people, even unborn babies!

Aurva's family, the Bhrigus, had no one to protect them. Aurvaâ€™s mom was pregnant with him when this happened and his heart was filled with rage.  He promised to punish everyone.  He said, "My anger is like a big fire. It will burn me up if I don't get revenge!"

Some wise spirits, called Pitris, told him, "Aurva, don't destroy the world! That's not good." But Aurva said, "I have to keep my promise!  If I don't, I'll be a failure."

The Pitris had an idea.  They said, "Pour your anger into the ocean!  The world needs water to live. Your anger will become part of the ocean."

Aurva listened to them. He poured his anger into the ocean.  His anger turned into a giant horse's head! This fiery horse's head, called Vadavamukha, lived in the ocean and consumed the water there.  It was still powerful, but it wasn't destroying the whole world.

Aurva was happy. He kept his promise, but he didn't destroy everything.  Everyone learned that even the strongest anger can be controlled, and sometimes, a different kind of strength is needed.
