Long ago, many wise and powerful people called Rishis went on a trip.  They were going to visit all the holy rivers and lakes.  Among them were famous Rishis like Agastya, Vasishtha, and even Indra, the king of the gods!

They all traveled together, and finally reached a beautiful lake.  They cleaned themselves in the holy water and started to eat lotus stems. Agastya picked some and put them on the bank. But when he went back, they were gone!

"Someone took my lotus stems!" Agastya said sadly. He felt very upset because it was unfair.  He was worried that bad things were starting to happen in the world. He said, "People will stop being kind.  Strong people will hurt the weak.  Smart people will ignore the rules. I don't want to see this happen!"

He said he would leave the world and go to heaven before all these bad things happened. The other Rishis were worried. "We didn't take your stems!" they said.  "We promise! We'll swear an oath!"

Each Rishi made a special promise. They said, "If we stole the stems, may bad things happen to us!" They all said very scary things that would happen if they lied. Bhrigu said, "If I stole them, may I always be punished!" Vasishtha said, "If I stole them, may I never learn again!"  Each Rishi made a different, serious promise.

Indra, the king of the gods, saw how upset everyone was.  He confessed, "I took the stems! But I only wanted to hear your important promises about being good." He felt bad and gave the stems back to Agastya. Agastya forgave him.

Everyone was happy. They continued their trip. Bhishma told this story to show that being good and keeping your promises is very important. He said that if you read this story, you'll always be kind, smart, and happy!
