Matali, Indra's driver, was on a journey.  He met Narada, a wise saint, who was visiting the god of the ocean, Varuna.

Narada asked Matali where he was going. Matali explained his mission. Narada said, "Let's go together! I'm visiting Varuna too!"

They traveled together, deep down to the ocean god's palace.  Narada was honored like a special guest, and Matali like Indra's driver.

They told Varuna why they were there.  Varuna let them explore his underwater kingdom, where the Nagas (snake people) lived.  Narada knew all the Nagas and told Matali all about them.

Narada showed Matali amazing things: Varuna’s family, beautiful palaces, and magical weapons!  He pointed out Pushkara, Varuna’s son, who was going to marry Jyotsnakali, the beautiful daughter of the moon god.

Narada explained that these weapons were super powerful.  They belonged to the gods and were once used against the evil Daityas (demons).  He showed Matali a special bow, even more powerful than Arjuna’s famous bow!

Narada also showed Matali Varuna's special umbrella, which rained magical water you couldn't see!  There were so many amazing things to see, but Narada said, "We need to go, or we'll be late!"  So, they continued on their journey.
