King Yudhisthira asked his wise grandfather Bhishma, "Grandpa, what happens to people who promise to give something to a priest but don't?"

Bhishma said, "Imagine someone who promises a gift but doesn't give it.  It's like a sad man who can't have children – all his hopes will fail.  Everything good he does – good deeds, prayers, gifts, even hard work – will be useless!  The scriptures say this is true."

Bhishma continued, "It's like a story I heard.  A jackal and a monkey were friends in their past lives as humans. After they died and were reborn, the jackal saw the monkey and asked, 'Why are you a monkey?' The monkey said, 'I stole things from priests in my last life.'  The jackal said, 'I didn't give a gift I promised a priest, that's why I'm a hungry jackal eating rotten meat!"

Bhishma told Yudhisthira, "My teacher, and even Lord Krishna, told me the same thing.  Never take things from a priest.  Always be kind to them.  If you promise a gift, give it. A priest who's been promised something is like a fire – he can bring great good luck or great misfortune!

"If you make priests happy, they will bring good things to your kingdom.  They'll help your family, your people, your land.  Their blessings are powerful, like the sun! So, Yudhisthira, always keep your promises to priests.  Giving gifts to them is the best thing you can do, it helps everyone and you'll have a good next life!"
