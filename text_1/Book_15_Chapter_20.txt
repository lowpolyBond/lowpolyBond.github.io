Once upon a time, many wise and holy men came to visit King Dhritarashtra.  There was Narada, Parvata, and Devala â€“ they were super-holy!  Vyasa, his students, and other really smart people also came.  Even old, good King Satayupa came to visit. Queen Kunti welcomed everyone nicely.

The holy men talked to King Dhritarashtra about being good and doing the right thing. Then Narada, who could see everything, told a story.

"Long ago," Narada said, "there was a king named Sahasrachitya. He was super rich and brave!  He gave his kingdom to his son and went to live in the forest. He was so good, he went to live with the King of the Gods, Indra!"

Narada told stories of other kings who went to live with Indra because they were so good and did so many good deeds.  He said, "King Dhritarashtra, you are doing good things too! Because of your good deeds, you'll go to a wonderful place after you die!"

Narada told the king that he'd be joined by his wife, Gandhari, and that their son, Yudhishthira, would be very good and wise.  He even said that Vidura and Sanjaya would go to Heaven too!

Everyone was happy to hear this.  King Dhritarashtra was very pleased.  Satayupa asked Narada where Dhritarashtra would go after he died.

Narada said, "I saw King Pandu in heaven.  I talked to Indra, the King of the Gods.  Indra told me Dhritarashtra has three years left to live. Then, Dhritarashtra and Gandhari will go to Kuvera, the king of treasures. They'll travel in a beautiful chariot and live happily with him!"

Everyone was overjoyed.  The holy men left, feeling good about all the happy news they had shared.  The end!
