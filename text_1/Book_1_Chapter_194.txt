Once upon a time, the Pandava brothers – Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva – went to a potter's house.  Secretly, Dhrishtadyumna, the prince of Panchala, followed them and hid!

That evening, the brothers brought back food from their alms-giving.  Their mother, Kunti, kindly told Draupadi (the princess): "My dear, first offer some food to the gods and Brahmins. Then feed everyone, and give some to our guests.  Give half the food to Bhima, he's very hungry! Divide the other half into six parts – four for the brothers, one for me, and one for you."

Draupadi did as she was told.  After they ate, Sahadeva made a bed of grass.  The brothers slept with their heads to the south.  Kunti slept by their heads, and Draupadi slept by their feet. Draupadi didn't mind sleeping like that.

The brothers talked all night about amazing things like chariots, weapons, and elephants. Dhrishtadyumna, hidden nearby, listened to everything! He even saw Draupadi sleeping near the brothers.

The next morning, Dhrishtadyumna rushed to tell his father, King Drupada.  The King was very worried.  He didn't know who had taken his daughter. He asked Dhrishtadyumna, "Who took Krishna (Draupadi)? Did a low-class person take her?  Or was it a high-class warrior or a Brahmin? I'd be very happy if she married Arjuna, the best warrior!  Did Arjuna win her by stringing the bow?"
