Once upon a time, during a great war, the wicked Duryodhana and his friends were losing.  They were worried about the Pandava brothers, who were very strong warriors.

Duryodhana said, "Bhishma, Drona, and Kripa – our best fighters – aren't defeating the Pandavas!  I'm running out of soldiers and weapons!  What can we do?"

Karna, a brave but tricky warrior, had a plan. He said, "Don't worry, Duryodhana!  I'll defeat the Pandavas, but first, we need Bhishma to stop fighting.  He's too kind to the Pandavas and won't really try to hurt them.  Once Bhishma rests, I will win the war!"

Duryodhana was excited. He and his brother Dussasana got ready to visit Bhishma.  Duryodhana looked very grand – all dressed up on a beautiful horse, with lots of soldiers and friends following him, like a shining sun surrounded by stars!

They arrived at Bhishma's tent. Duryodhana, with tears in his eyes, begged Bhishma, "We need your help!  You are our strongest warrior! Please defeat the Pandavas. If you won't, let Karna fight. He promised to defeat them for us."

Then Duryodhana stopped talking. He waited anxiously to see if Bhishma would agree.  What will Bhishma do?  The war hung in the balance!
