Yudhishthira was very sad.  He looked at all the dead kings on the battlefield.  They were strong, like ten thousand elephants each!  He wondered, "Who can kill such strong warriors?  And what is death, anyway? Where does it come from?"

Bhishma, a wise old man, told him a story.  Long ago, King Anukampaka lost his son, Hari, in a battle.  He was so sad! He met Narada, a wise sage.

Narada said, "Long ago, when the world was first made, everyone lived forever.  The world became too full!  Brahma, the creator, got angry.  Fire came out of him!  It burned everything â€“ the sky, the earth, and all the living things!"

But then, another god, Sthanu, felt sorry.  He asked Brahma for a way to help.  "What do you wish?" Brahma asked Sthanu.

(This is just the beginning of the story. The next part would explain how death came to be, as part of the creation story.)
