Once upon a time, in a land far away, there was a great storyteller named Sauti.  He was telling a king and some wise men a story about snakes!

He had already told them how the snakes' mother was angry and cursed them. He'd also told them about her sisters' magical powers. He'd even told them the names of the mother's sons, the half-bird, half-snake children!

But the wise men wanted to know more. "Tell us the names of all the snakes!" they cried.

Sauti chuckled. "There are *so many* snakes!" he said.  "I can't tell you *all* their names!  It would take forever!"

But he did tell them the names of some of the most important ones.  First came Sesha, a very special snake. Then came Vasuki, another famous snake.  And then many, many more!  There was Airavata, Takshaka, Karkotaka, and lots and lots of others with long and interesting names. Sauti listed many more names, like Dhananjaya, Kalakeya, Mani, and so on.  He named so many that even *you* might get tired of hearing them!

Finally, Sauti stopped.  "That's enough!" he said. "There are so many more snakes â€“ thousands and thousands and millions!  It's impossible to name them all!"

And that's how the story ended.  The wise men were amazed at how many snakes there were in the world!
