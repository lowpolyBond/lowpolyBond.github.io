Once upon a time, in the land of Bharatavarsha, a wise king named Yudhishthira asked his grandfather, Bhishma, a very smart and experienced man, "Grandpa, what kind of people should I choose to help me rule my kingdom?"

Bhishma smiled.  "My dear Yudhishthira," he said, "choose your helpers carefully!  Your lawmakers should be honest, brave, and polite. They should always tell the truth."

"Your war ministers," Bhishma continued, "should be strong, brave, very smart, and always loyal to you, especially when things are tough."

"Your courtiers," he said, "should be from good families, always working hard for you, no matter what.  They should never leave you, whether you are happy or sad, sick or well."

"Your army officers," Bhishma explained, "should be born in your kingdom, smart, handsome, and respectful. Most importantly, they should be truly devoted to you."

Bhishma warned, "Don't trust people who are greedy, cruel, or dishonest. They'll only be your friends as long as they get something from you!"

"Your advisors," Bhishma said, "should be kind, wise, and always truthful. They should know what to do in any situation and always want what's best for you. They should be brave enough to always do what is right, even if it is hard. They should never give up on you."

Bhishma stressed the importance of choosing advisors who are brave, are always honest, and know when to stay calm. They should also be kind and forgiving.

"Always listen to the opinions of many, but sometimes one person, who is exceptionally talented and skilled, should be chosen over many others," Bhishma added.

Bhishma also advised Yudhishthira to always check if his ministers were good people or not.  He should look for ministers from good families, who are honest and kind. He said a king should have at least five such wise and trustworthy ministers.

Bhishma said, "A king should never trust a minister who isn't loyal.  A disloyal minister is like fire, slowly destroying everything from the inside!"

"A good minister will forgive a king if he gets angry and says something mean," Bhishma explained. "But never trust a minister who is sneaky or unfriendly, even if they seem very clever."

Bhishma also explained how a king should choose the right place for important meetings and who should be there.  He should choose a quiet, open place where everyone can see clearly.  He said it shouldn't be crowded and it should not have any people who are very different physically.

"A king should always listen to the advice of his ministers, then talk it over with his wise teacher, a very learned Brahman," Bhishma concluded. "Only then should the king decide how to rule his kingdom."  That way, he will always have good advice and make the right decisions.  This way, everyone will be happy, and the kingdom will thrive!
