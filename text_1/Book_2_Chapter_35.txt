King Dasaratha's advisor, Sumantra, was furious! He was so angry he stomped his feet, gritted his teeth, and his face turned red.  He was very upset with Queen Kaikeyi.

Sumantra shouted at Kaikeyi, "You've hurt the king, our protector! You've done terrible things!  You're like a murderer, destroying your own family!"

He explained, "You made the king give up Rama, his oldest son, and crown your son, Bharata, instead. That's not right! The eldest son always becomes king.  It's like cutting down a sweet mango tree to plant a bitter neem tree.  Neem trees don't give sweet fruit, even if you water them with milk!"

Sumantra told a story about Kaikeyi's mother.  Her father was a king who could understand what animals said. He heard two ants talking and laughed. Kaikeyi's mother got really angry and made her husband leave her.  Sumantra said, "You're just like your mother! Youâ€™re being selfish and mean."

He begged Kaikeyi, "Please, ask the king to crown Rama!  If Rama goes to the forest, everyone will blame you.  It's better for everyone if Rama is king."

But Kaikeyi didn't listen. She didn't feel sorry.  Her face didn't change at all.  She still wanted Bharata to be king.
