Rama, the best prince ever, was leaving his home.  He was going to live in the forest for fourteen years!  When the palace ladies saw him going, they cried.  "Rama is so good! He always helped us. Why is the king sending him away?" they wailed, like sad cows missing their babies.

The king heard their crying and felt very, very sad. He felt ashamed.  Rama, feeling sorry for his family, went to see his mother, Queen Kaushalya.  He greeted the guards and wise men along the way.  At the third gate, he met women and children who wished him well.

Queen Kaushalya was praying to God.  She was wearing a beautiful white dress and had lots of yummy food ready for her prayers. When she saw Rama, she rushed to hug him. "My dear son," she said, "May you live a long and good life! You'll be a great king one day!"  She gave him sweet treats.

Rama sadly told his mother, "I have to go to the forest.  The king wants Prince Bharata to rule instead. I'll eat only berries and roots for fourteen years."

Hearing this, Queen Kaushalya fell to the ground, like a big tree that's been cut down. Rama helped her up.  "Oh, my son," she cried, "If you weren't my son, I'd be sad because I'd have no child. But now, I'm even sadder!  The other queens will be mean to me.  What will I do without you?"

She was very angry at the king. "How can I face those other queens? Iâ€™ve prayed and fasted for you all these years! It feels like everything has been for nothing.  I wish I could die!  I want to go to the forest with you!" She cried and cried, like a bird whose baby has been taken away.  She was so sad because Rama, her good and loving son, was leaving her.
