King Janamejaya asked Vyasa, a wise old man, about Gandhari's children.  Vyasa had told him about Gandhari's hundred sons, but not her daughter, Duhsala. Janamejaya was curious. How could she have a daughter when Vyasa had made a hundred sons from a magic ball of flesh?

Vyasa explained.  He had divided the magic ball into a hundred pieces, one for each son.  But while he was doing this, Gandhari, who was a very good and kind woman, wished for a daughter.  She wanted a daughter so her husband would be happy, and so she could have grandchildren through her daughter.  She prayed really hard for this to happen.

As Vyasa was dividing the ball of flesh, he heard Gandhari's wish.  He had one extra piece of the magic ball!  He smiled and said, "This extra piece will become your daughter, just as you wished!"  He put this last piece into a special pot, and that's how Duhsala was born.

Janamejaya was happy to finally understand.  He said, "Thank you, Vyasa, that was a wonderful story!"
