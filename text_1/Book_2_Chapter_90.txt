Prince Bharata was walking to see a wise, old hermit named Bharadvaja.  He left his army and his fancy clothes behind.  He wore simple clothes and walked with his teacher, Vasishtha.

When they reached the hermitage, Bharadvaja greeted them. He offered them fruit and drink.  He asked about Bharata's family and the kingdom of Ayodhya. He knew King Dasaratha, Bharata's father, was dead, so he didn't ask about him.

Bharata and Vasishtha asked about the hermit's health and his animals.  Then Bharadvaja asked Bharata a tough question. He said, "Bharata, you're king now.  Why are you here?  Did you help your stepmother send your brother Rama away to the forest for fourteen years?"

Bharata's eyes filled with tears.  He said, "That's not true!  I never wanted Rama to go.  I didn't approve of what my mother did. I'm going to find Rama and bring him home!"

Bharadvaja smiled.  He knew Bharata was a good person.  He said, "I knew that already! Rama and his brother Lakshmana are on a mountain called Cittrakuta. Go there tomorrow."

Bharata spent the night at the hermitage. He was happy to know where to find his brother.  He was ready to bring Rama home.
