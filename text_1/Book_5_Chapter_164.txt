Once upon a time, there was a big war about to begin.  Arjuna, a very strong warrior, was angry with Duryodhana, who was a boastful and unfair king.  Arjuna’s eyes flashed red with anger.

Arjuna said, “Duryodhana, it’s cowardly to win a fight only because you have stronger people fighting for you. A true warrior fights with his own strength. You’re using Bhishma, a very wise and good old warrior, like a weapon, knowing he might die! You're bragging because you think the Pandavas, my family, are too kind to hurt Bhishma. But I’ll kill Bhishma first, right in front of everyone!”

Arjuna sent a message to Duryodhana through a messenger named Uluka.  He said, "Tell Duryodhana the battle starts tomorrow. Bhishma promised to win the war for him. But I’ll defeat Bhishma, then Drona, and then, after that, even Duryodhana has no chance!  I fight for what is right, not for power.  I only asked for five villages, not an entire kingdom."

Bhima, Arjuna's brother, was also angry. He sent a message saying, “Tell that wicked Duryodhana that I will kill his brother Dussasana and drink his blood! I will break Duryodhana’s legs and kill all his brothers!  Duryodhana will be defeated.”

Nakula and Sahadeva, Arjuna’s other brothers, sent messages too.  They said they would fight as hard as they could, and Duryodhana would be sorry for his boasting.

Even King Virata and King Drupada, wise old kings, sent messages saying they were ready to fight.  Sikhandin said he would kill Bhishma. Dhrishtadyumna said he would kill Drona.

Even Yudhishthira, the kindest of the Pandava brothers, sent a message. He said, "It’s Duryodhana’s fault this war is happening. But my brothers will fight, and they will win."

Uluka, the messenger, went to Duryodhana and told him everything.  Duryodhana, furious, told his army to get ready for war before sunrise the next day. Messengers rushed through the camp to spread the news. The great war was about to begin!
