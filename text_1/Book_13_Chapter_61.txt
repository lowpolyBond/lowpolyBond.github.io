Yudhishthira, the king, asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandpa, how can I get the best rewards for giving gifts and doing good things?  Is the reward now, or later?  What's better: giving gifts or doing sacrifices?  Who should I give gifts to? How and when should I do these things?"

Bhishma said, "My dear Yudhishthira, kings often fight. Giving gifts and doing sacrifices makes them good people again.  Good people don't accept gifts from kings who do bad things. So, you should always do sacrifices and give lots of gifts!

Give gifts to good people, especially wise priests who know the holy books and help everyone. If they don’t accept your gifts, it doesn't count.  Give them yummy food. Think of every gift as a sacrifice.  If you give gifts to priests during their ceremonies, you get some of the good luck too! Help priests who have families, so they can keep helping people.  This will help you have a big, happy family, just like the creator of the world!

Help good people, those who always do the right thing. Give them everything you can! Give priests cows, food, clothes, shoes, and even carriages! Give them butter, houses, and comfy beds. This will bring you good things!  Find priests who need help, and secretly or openly, give them what they need. This is even better than big, fancy sacrifices!  This will help you go to heaven!

Use your money to help your kingdom.  Be kind to everyone. But don't use money taken unfairly to do good things.  Only use money given happily by your people! Protect the money of the old, the young, the blind, and anyone who needs help. Don't take money from poor people, especially if they’ve only just grown a little food after a long drought, or from sad, crying women.  Taking from the poor hurts everyone!  Always give lots of food to good people!  It's very bad if children are hungry while others have plenty.  If even one priest is hungry in your kingdom, it's as bad as killing a baby!  King Sivi said it himself: ‘A kingdom where anyone goes hungry is a bad kingdom!’

A kingdom where women are unsafe is a bad kingdom, too!  Your people should even kill a king who doesn't protect them, takes all their money, and is mean! It’s like killing a rabid dog!  If you don’t protect your people, you’ll share some of their bad deeds.  If you do protect them, you get some of their good deeds!  Be a king who is so good that everyone feels safe, just like people look for shelter during a storm, or birds look for shelter in a big tree. Let everyone come to you for help!"
