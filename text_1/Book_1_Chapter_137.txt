Once upon a time, in the land of Kuru, there was a big contest! King Duryodhana and the strong Bhima were ready to fight.  The crowd cheered loudly for their favorites. It was so noisy, it was like a stormy ocean!

A wise man, Bharadwaja, told his son Aswatthaman to stop them.  The fight was getting too wild! Aswatthaman calmed them down.  Their weapons were raised high, like giant waves.

Then, everyone's favorite, Arjuna, arrived! He was like the son of a god!  He was strong and brave. He wore shiny golden armor and looked amazing, like a rainbow in the sunset.  The crowd went wild! They cheered and shouted.  Arjuna's mother, Kunti, cried happy tears.  Even the blind King Dhritarashtra heard the noise and asked what was happening. Vidura told him Arjuna had arrived.

Arjuna showed off his amazing skills! He used his magic weapons to make fire, water, air, clouds, land, and even mountains appear, and then disappear with a snap of his fingers! He was so fast, he seemed to be everywhere at once! He could shoot five arrows into a tiny hole, and twenty-one arrows into a cow's horn! He was incredibly skillful with his sword, bow, and mace.

When Arjuna finished, it got quiet. Then, BOOM!  A loud noise like thunder made everyone jump.  Everyone looked to see who it was.  It was Drona, Arjuna's teacher, standing with the five Pandava brothers.  They looked as amazing as the moon and stars.  On the other side, Duryodhana and his one hundred brothers stood ready to fight, looking strong and fierce!
