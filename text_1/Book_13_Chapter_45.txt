Once upon a time, in the land of Bharat, a wise king named Yudhishthira asked his grandfather, Bhishma, a very important question.  "Grandpa," he said, "if a man gives a gift to a girl's family to marry her, and then he leaves, what happens to the girl?"

Bhishma, who was very wise, answered, "If the girl's father is rich but has no sons, he should keep her safe, waiting for her husband to return. But if the husband doesn’t come back and doesn’t return the gift, then the girl belongs to the man who gave the gift. She can even have children with someone else while her husband is gone.  But she can't marry anyone else properly."

Bhishma told Yudhishthira a story about Princess Savitri.  She chose her own husband, which some people liked and some people didn't.  Bhishma said, "The best way to know what's right is to look at how good people behave."  He explained that women weren't supposed to choose their own husbands.

Then Yudhishthira asked another question. "Grandpa, how do people inherit money when someone only has a daughter?"

Bhishma replied, "A daughter is just as important as a son!  If someone has only a daughter, she inherits everything.  If she has a son, he shares the inheritance. If a father adopts a son, the daughter still gets more. If a father sells his daughter, that’s wrong! The sons she has after that don't get anything from her father because he gave her away."

Bhishma said that selling your daughter is a terrible thing to do.  It’s a very bad thing that makes people mean and dishonest.  He told Yudhishthira about a story about Yama, the god of death, who said that people who sell their children go to a terrible hell!  

Bhishma talked about different ways people got married. Some people gave gifts to marry a girl, and some even took girls by force! That is bad too. Bhishma said that selling your own daughter or son is like selling a part of yourself and is very, very wrong.  It’s better to do good things than to get rich by doing bad things, he said.
