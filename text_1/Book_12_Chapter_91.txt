Once upon a time, a wise man named Utathya talked to King Mandhatri. He said, "A good king makes his people happy.  If it rains well and the king is kind, everyone thrives!  A good king is like a skilled washerman.  He cleans the dirt from clothes without ruining them.  The same is true for people. Each person has a job:  Sudras work hard, Vaisyas farm, Kshatriyas keep order, and Brahmins teach and pray."

Utathya explained, "A good Kshatriya king helps everyone do their job right. He's like a father to his people. The world is better when the king is good.  When a king is not good, things go wrong.  The world is like a big tree. The king is the trunk. If the trunk gets sick, the whole tree suffers! The animals and people all feel the king's goodness or badness."

Utathya said, "The king is powerful.  He should protect the weak.  Never hurt anyone who is helpless.  If the king is mean to the weak, it's like fire that burns everything.  The king’s family and his kingdom suffer.  The king creates good or bad things depending on his behavior.  If the king is unkind, he brings bad luck on himself and his people. And the bad things follow his family for generations. It's like a bad seed that makes a bad plant."

He continued, "If the king's helpers are unfair, the whole kingdom suffers.  It’s like a big, strong tree that everyone depends on. If the tree is cut down, everyone loses their home.  If people are good, the king is happy. If people are bad, the king suffers too."

Utathya told the king, "A good king is fair.  He honors his helpers and punishes bad people. He helps people in need, and shares what he has with others. He should be brave and wise. A good king always does what is right. He is kind and strong. He loves his people and helps everyone live happily."

Utathya added, "Being a king is a great responsibility. Only wise and brave kings can rule well. A good king loves everyone, is brave and wise. He never forgets his duty and always helps those in need. He follows the rules and is fair to everyone."

King Mandhatri listened carefully.  He followed Utathya's advice.  He became a wonderful king, and ruled the whole earth with kindness!  Bhishma, another wise man, told the story, “You, too, should be a good king like Mandhatri. Then you will rule well and have a happy place in Heaven."
