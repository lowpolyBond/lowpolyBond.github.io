King Yudhishthira was sad. His brothers and Krishna were worried about Arjuna.  Then, a bright, shiny Rishi named Narada appeared!  He looked like a magical fire.

Yudhishthira and his brothers bowed to Narada.  Yudhishthira's wife, Draupadi, stayed close to her husbands, just like the sun shines on Mount Meru.

Narada smiled and said, "Great King, what troubles you? How can I help?"

Yudhishthira, with his brothers, asked Narada a question. He wanted to know about Arjuna's journey around the world, seeing holy places and rivers.

Narada replied, "I'll tell you a story.  Bhishma, a very wise and good man, once lived near the source of the Ganges River. He was very holy, and he pleased the gods and ancestors with his prayers.

One day, Bhishma met the great Rishi Pulastya. Bhishma was very happy and bowed down to him. He said, 'I am Bhishma, your servant. Seeing you takes away all my sins!' Bhishma stood quietly, his hands pressed together. Rishi Pulastya was so happy to see such a devoted man."
