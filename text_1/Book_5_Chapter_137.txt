Once upon a time, Kunti, Arjuna's mother, had a secret.  A long time ago, when Arjuna was born, a magical voice spoke from the sky!  The voice said, "This boy will be as strong as a god! He'll defeat all the Kauravas in battle. With his brother Bhima, he'll rule the whole world!  With Krishna's help, he'll win back what's rightfully his!"  Kunti remembered this prophecy and knew it was true.

Kunti asked Krishna, a powerful friend, to deliver a message to her sons.  She wanted Krishna to remind Arjuna how brave and strong he was, a true warrior.  She asked him to tell Bhima, her other son, that it was time to fight for what was right. Bhima loved a good fight!  She wanted Krishna to praise her other daughter-in-law, Draupadi, for being so strong and kind.

Kunti also wanted Krishna to remind her sons of the terrible things that had happened to Draupadi.  She was insulted and humiliated by the Kauravas.  This hurt Kunti more than anything – even losing their kingdom. Kunti wanted her sons to remember this, to fight for justice, and to protect Draupadi.

Krishna, strong and brave like a lion, went to see the Pandavas. He told them everything Kunti said.  Then, he rode away in his chariot, leaving the Kauravas to worry. They knew what Krishna’s visit meant—a big war was coming! They worried that their bad actions would lead to their destruction.

Krishna traveled fast, like the wind! He went to see Karna, an important friend, and then continued on his journey to Upaplavya.  The journey was long, but Krishna and his swift horses soon arrived.  A great battle was coming, and the prophecy about Arjuna was about to come true.
