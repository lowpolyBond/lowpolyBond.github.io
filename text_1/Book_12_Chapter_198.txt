Yudhishthira, a very good king, asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandpa, what happens to someone who reads and understands holy scriptures?"

Bhishma smiled.  "My dear Yudhishthira, you are always doing what is right. Listen closely!  Imagine beautiful places in heaven.  Shiny palaces, gardens with golden flowers, places ruled by powerful gods – these are all wonderful, right?"

"Yes," said Yudhishthira.

"But," said Bhishma, "even these amazing places are like tiny rooms compared to the greatest place of all! This greatest place is beyond our imagination. It’s a place without fear, sadness, or pain. There's no darkness or worry there. It's perfect!"

"How can someone get there?" asked Yudhishthira.

"By focusing on their inner self, their soul," Bhishma explained. "If someone understands the true meaning of the scriptures and lives a good life, then they go to this perfect place.  They never feel sad again. Compared to this perfect place, all other places, even the beautiful ones in heaven, are just like… well, like hell!"
