King Dhritarashtra was very excited!  He told his wise advisor, Vidura, "Krishna is coming! He's the best leader, brave and strong. He's like a superhero to the Vrishnis, his people. They love him like everyone loves the sun."

Dhritarashtra planned a HUGE welcome.  "I'll give Krishna sixteen shiny gold carriages, each pulled by four beautiful horses!  And eight giant elephants with long tusks, each with its own helpers.  I'll give him one hundred pretty maids and lots of servants.  I'll give him soft blankets, deer skins, and a special magic jewel that glows all the time! I'll even give him my super-fast carriage that travels far each day!"

He continued, "I'll give Krishna way more food than he needs for his whole group.  All my sons and grandsons, except Duryodhana, will go meet him in their special carriages.  Lots of dancers will come out to greet him, and all the women will show their faces happily. Everyone in the city, with their families, should welcome Krishna like they welcome the morning sun.  We'll decorate everything beautifully! The streets will be clean and shiny. Krishna will stay in Dussasana’s amazing palace – it’s even better than Duryodhana’s! I'll give Krishna anything he needs or wants."
