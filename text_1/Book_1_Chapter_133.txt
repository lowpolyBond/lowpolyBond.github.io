Once upon a time, a wise teacher named Drona lived secretly in Hastinapura.  He was a great warrior, and his son, Aswatthaman, was even better at fighting!  Secretly, Aswatthaman taught the princes of Hastinapura how to fight.

One day, the princes were playing ball.  The ball fell down a deep, dry well. They tried and tried to get it out, but they couldn't!  They were very sad.

Then, they saw a thin, old Brahman man nearby.  He was Drona!  Drona smiled.  "Shame on you, brave princes!" he said. "Can't you even get a ball out of a well?  If you give me a nice dinner, I'll get the ball outâ€”and this ring, too!" He tossed his ring into the well.

The princes were so happy!  Yudhishthira, the eldest prince, promised Drona whatever he wanted.

Drona took some long grass.  "Watch!" he said. He used the grass like magic, making it strong and stiff.  He used one blade of grass to hook the ball, then another, and another, until he pulled the ball right out of the well!  The princes were amazed!

"Now, get the ring!" they cried.

Drona used a bow and arrow to get the ring out. He gave it to the princes, and they were very impressed.  "Who are you?" they asked.

Drona said, "Tell Bhishma, the king's advisor, about what you saw. He'll know who I am."

The princes told Bhishma everything. Bhishma knew right away who Drona was and was very happy. He asked Drona to teach the princes.

Drona told Bhishma his story.  Long ago, he and King Drupada were friends. Drupada promised Drona his kingdom, but later, when Drupada became a king, he refused to keep his promise.  He was unkind and made fun of Drona because he was poor.

Drona felt very sad and angry.  He wanted to teach the princes because he needed to make a living for his son, Aswatthaman.

Bhishma said, "Drona, you will be the best teacher for our princes!  You are welcome here.  The kingdom is yours!"

And so, Drona became the teacher of the princes, and he trained them to become great warriors.
