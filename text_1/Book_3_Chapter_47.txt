Once upon a time, a wise old man named Lomasa visited Indra, the king of the gods.  He saw Arjuna, a prince, sitting on Indra's special chair! Lomasa was surprised.  How could a prince sit there?

Indra smiled and explained, "Arjuna isn't just any prince. He's my son!"  He told Lomasa a secret: Arjuna and his brother Krishna were actually ancient, powerful gods, Nara and Narayana, who had come to Earth to help.

Why?  Because some very bad guys, the Nivatakavachas, were planning to hurt the gods. They were so strong, even all the gods together couldn't defeat them!  Only Nara (Krishna) and Narayana (Arjuna) could win. Arjuna needed special weapons to fight them, and that's why he was with Indra.

Indra asked Lomasa to go to Earth and tell Arjuna's brothers, especially Yudhishthira, not to worry.  Arjuna would return as a great warrior, ready to fight their enemies. He also told Lomasa to protect Yudhishthira and his brothers while they were hiding in the forest, because scary monsters lived there.

Arjuna then told Lomasa to protect Yudhishthira too, and said he should visit holy places and give gifts to good people.  This would help them be happy and strong.

Lomasa promised to help. He went to find Yudhishthira and his brothers, who were living in the forest, and gave them Indra's message.  And that's how Arjuna got ready to fight the bad guys!
