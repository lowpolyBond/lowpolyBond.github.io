Yudhishthira, a very good king, asked his grandpa Bhishma, "Grandpa, I heard about kings who went to heaven after giving gifts.  How many types of gifts are there? What happens good when you give gifts?  To whom should I give gifts, and why?"

Bhishma smiled. "My dear Yudhishthira, there are five types of gifts!  People give gifts for five reasons."

"First," Bhishma said, "people give gifts to be good and go to heaven.  These are gifts given for *merit*.  Giving to wise people, like priests, is a good way to earn merit."

"Second," Bhishma continued, "people give gifts because they hope to get something back.  Maybe they want a favor, or they want to be friends with someone important.  These are gifts given for *profit*."

"Third," Bhishma explained, "sometimes people give gifts out of *fear*.  They might be afraid of someone and give them a gift to keep them happy."

"Fourth," Bhishma said, "sometimes people give gifts to their *friends* because they love them. These are gifts given out of *love*."

"Fifth," Bhishma finished, "people give gifts because they feel *pity* for someone poor or in need. These are gifts given out of kindness."

"So," Bhishma told Yudhishthira, "giving gifts is wonderful.  Give gifts whenever you can, as much as you can!  God says to give, and it makes you a better person."
