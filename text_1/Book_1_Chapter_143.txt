Once upon a time, in a land far away, lived the Pandava brothers and their mother, Kunti.  Their cousins, the Kaurava brothers, led by the sneaky Duryodhana, were very jealous.

Duryodhana and his friends made a terrible plan.  They wanted to kill Kunti and her sons!  They whispered their secret plan to their father, King Dhritarashtra.

But a wise man named Vidura knew what they were planning. He saw the evil in their faces. Vidura loved the Pandavas, so he secretly helped them escape.  He built a strong boat for them.

Vidura told Kunti, “The Kauravas are dangerous! You and your sons must leave!  I have a boat for you. Escape quickly!”

Kunti was very sad, but she took her sons and got into the boat. They sailed away on the river.  Following Vidura's advice, they left the boat and went into the forest.

Meanwhile, the Kauravas had built a big house made of lacquer – a kind of shiny wood.  They set it on fire, hoping to burn the Pandavas inside.  But the Pandavas weren't there!  A poor woman and her children who happened to be in the house were sadly burned.  The Kauravas’ evil plan backfired.

The people in the city thought the Pandavas were dead. They were very sad. They told King Dhritarashtra, “The Pandavas are gone! You are king now!”

Dhritarashtra and his sons pretended to be sad, but secretly they were happy. They even held a fake funeral for the Pandavas.

The Kauravas had been mean and unfair to the Pandavas.  They were always jealous. People in the kingdom noticed the Pandavas were kind and good, and some thought the Pandavas should be the kings instead.

Duryodhana was very upset about this. He complained to his father, "Father, everyone likes the Pandavas better! They might become kings someday! We need to do something to stop them!"  But the Pandavas were already safe, hidden away in the forest. Their escape was a secret, known only to a few.
