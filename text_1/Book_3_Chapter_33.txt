Once upon a time, in the land of Bharat, the Pandava brothers lived in the forest.  Their cousin, Duryodhana, had cheated them out of their kingdom using unfair dice.  Yudhishthira, their kind king, was sad and wanted to stay peaceful.

But Bhima, the strong brother, was furious! He stormed up to Yudhishthira and said, "Brother, we are living like animals in the woods! We’ve lost our kingdom, our happiness, and everything good because of Duryodhana’s cheating. He stole it like a sneaky jackal taking food from mighty lions!"

Bhima continued, "It's your fault, brother. You were too kind and peaceful.  Because of you, our kingdom – protected by Arjuna's amazing bow – was stolen right from under our noses. We are suffering, and our friends are heartbroken! We should have fought back long ago!"

Bhima wasn't the only one upset.  Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva, and even Krishna agreed that Yudhishthira was being too peaceful. Bhima explained that being too good all the time wasn't always the best way to live.  He said, “True strength isn’t just about being good; it’s about being brave and fighting for what is right!”

Bhima reminded Yudhishthira that it's important to have wealth, happiness, and goodness in life – all three work together like friends. He said, "We are warriors! We must fight for our kingdom. Even if we die in battle, it's better than living like this. We can fight bravely and win back what is rightfully ours.  Our friends and allies, like Krishna and the Srinjayas, will help us!"

Yudhishthira listened to his brother's angry words. He knew Bhima was right.  It was time to fight for their kingdom!  He agreed to go to war and get back what was stolen from them.  They were ready to battle Duryodhana and his army, and show everyone that they were strong and brave warriors worthy of their kingdom.
