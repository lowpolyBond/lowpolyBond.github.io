Once upon a time, Krishna and Vidura talked late into the night.  Vidura loved listening to Krishna’s wise words.  Then, the next morning, musicians woke Krishna with trumpets and cymbals!

Krishna got up, took a bath, prayed, and offered gifts to the sun.  Just as he finished, Duryodhana and Sakuni arrived. They said, “King Dhritarashtra and all the Kurus are waiting for you!”

Krishna greeted them kindly.  Then he gave lots of gold, clothes, cows, and horses to some priests. After that, his chariot driver, Daruka, brought his shiny chariot, pulled by strong horses.  It jingled with bells!

Krishna, with Vidura, Duryodhana, and Sakuni following in their own chariots, rode to the king's palace.  Many soldiers and many elephants marched with him.  People lined the streets to see him; even the balconies were full!  The city was alive with music and excitement.

When Krishna arrived at the palace, everyone was thrilled!  The king, Dhritarashtra, and all the other important people stood up to greet him. A special golden seat was ready for Krishna.

Krishna sat down, and everyone was quiet. Then Krishna noticed some wise holy men, Rishis, standing outside.  He asked that they be invited inside and given special seats.  Everyone waited until the holy men were seated before sitting again.

Karna and Duryodhana sat close to Krishna, while Vidura sat nearby. Everyone watched Krishna; they couldn't stop looking at him. He looked beautiful in his yellow clothes.  Then, it was completely silent in the great hall.  Everyone waited to hear what Krishna would say next.
