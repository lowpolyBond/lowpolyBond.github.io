Once upon a time, a great battle was about to begin.  The Kuru army was ready.  Drums banged, horns blew, and the air filled with noise!  It was so loud, it made everyone's hair stand on end!

Then, Arjuna, the mighty warrior, arrived.  Lots of crows and ravens flew around his chariot.  Scary animals howled.  The earth shook!  The wind blew hard. It was a very scary day!

Arjuna's army was ready too.  Durmarshana, a brave warrior from the other side, stood proudly. He said, "I will fight Arjuna!  I’m strong as a mountain against the sea!"

Arjuna, shining bright like the sun, was ready to fight. He was strong and brave. His friend Krishna blew his horn too.  The sound was so loud and scary, it made the enemy army tremble!  Even the animals were afraid.  Some soldiers were so scared, they didn't know what to do!

Arjuna's monkey on his flag even yelled to scare them more!  Then the battle began!

Arjuna fought bravely.  He was so fast! He shot arrows like rain.  Many soldiers fell. The ground was covered with arrows, broken weapons, and sadly, many dead soldiers.  It was a terrible battle. Arjuna was so quick, nobody could even get close to him. He shot elephants, horses, and soldiers—everyone!  He was like a storm!

The enemy army was scared and ran away.  They tried to escape, but many ran into each other in their fear.   It was a very sad and messy fight.  Arjuna was a very powerful warrior.
