King Kubera, the treasure king, spoke to Yudhishthira.  "To succeed, you need five things: patience, skill, the right time, the right place, and bravery," he said. "Long ago, people were patient and good at their jobs.  A brave king who's patient and knows when and where to act can rule for a long, long time."  He explained that being angry and foolish leads to trouble. Only smart people who know the right time to do things succeed.  Kubera said Bhimasena, the strong one, was brave but sometimes too impulsive.  "Yudhishthira, you need to help him be more careful," he advised.

Kubera told Yudhishthira to stay safe in a sage's hermitage for a while.  Friendly Gandharvas (magical beings) would protect him and his brothers. "Don't worry, the forest creatures will help you, and my servants will bring you delicious food and drink," he promised.  Kubera explained that each Pandava brother had a powerful protector: Arjuna was protected by Indra, Bhima by the wind god, and Yudhishthira by Dharma (righteousness).  He said Arjuna was learning to fight in Indra's sky palace, and their great-great-grandfather, Santanu, was proud of him.

The Pandavas were happy with Kubera's words.  They bowed to him. Kubera told them to be kind to their friends and fight their enemies bravely. He said Arjuna would soon return after mastering his fighting skills.  Then, Kubera disappeared with many Yakshas (magical beings) and Rakshasas (demons) in their fancy carriages. The sky roared like a flock of birds as they flew away.

Kubera's magic cleared away the dead bodies of the Rakshasas from the mountain.  A wise saint's curse on the Rakshasas was finally over. The Pandavas stayed in the mountain happily for many nights, honored by the Rakshasas.
