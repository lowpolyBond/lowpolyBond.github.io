Once, there was a great battle.  Bhishma was a brave warrior.  After a long fight, Bhishma's charioteer pulled out all the arrows from Bhishma and his horses.

The next morning, the battle started again! Bhishma's horses were fresh and ready to go. Bhishma, in his shiny armor, got ready to fight Rama, another strong warrior.

Bhishma and Rama bowed to each other. Then, they started shooting arrows!  Whoosh!  Hundreds and thousands of arrows flew through the air!  They kept shooting and shooting, each trying to hit the other.

Rama used special magic arrows. Bhishma used his own magic arrows to stop them! They were like a magical arrow fight!  Back and forth, they shot their special arrows.

Suddenly, Rama shot a really fast arrow and hit Bhishma.  Bhishma fainted! His charioteer rushed him away.

Rama's friends cheered!  But Bhishma woke up! He told his charioteer, "Take me back to Rama! I'm ready to fight again!"

Bhishma raced back to Rama.  He started shooting arrows again.  But this time, Rama was even faster! He shot three arrows for every one of Bhishma's.

Then, Bhishma shot a super strong arrow at Rama!  It was so powerful, Rama fainted! Everyone gasped. Rama's friends rushed to help him.

They cooled Rama down with water. Soon, Rama woke up.  He shot an arrow at Bhishma.  Bhishma was hurt!  They kept shooting arrows.  It was a huge arrow battle with so many arrows that the sky got dark and smoky!

The arrows burned up and fell to the ground as ashes.  The battle was incredible, with arrows flying everywhere!

Finally, it got dark. Bhishma's teacher said it was time to stop fighting. The big battle ended for the day.
