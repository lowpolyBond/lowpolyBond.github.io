Once upon a time, the Pandava brothers lived with their mother, Kunti.  Bhima, the strongest brother, promised to help a Brahmin (a wise holy man).  He said, "I will do it!"

Yudhishthira, the oldest brother, saw Bhima looked worried. He asked Kunti, "Mom, what big thing did Bhima promise to do? Did you ask him?"

Kunti said, "Yes, it's for the Brahmin and to save our town. Bhima will help."

Yudhishthira was scared. He said, "Mom, that sounds super dangerous! It's almost like asking Bhima to die! Why would you ask him to do something so risky?  Bhima is our protector! He helped us escape many times!  Heâ€™s so strong, even Duryodhana and Sakuni are afraid of him! How could you even think of this?"

Kunti explained, "Yudhishthira, don't worry about Bhima. I'm not silly. This Brahmin has been so kind to us. He deserves our thanks.  Remember how strong Bhima is? He carried all of us out of the house of wax, and he defeated Hidimva! He's as strong as ten thousand elephants! He even fell from my lap onto a rock as a baby, and the rock broke! That's how strong he is! I trust him to defeat the Brahmin's enemy."

"This isn't just about helping the Brahmin," Kunti continued. "It's also the right thing to do.  Helping others is very important.  Helping a Brahmin brings good luck, and saving someone's life is the best thing a warrior can do.  That's what a good king should always do."  

Yudhishthira finally understood why his mother asked Bhima to do this dangerous task.  He still worried, but he trusted his mother and knew Bhima was very strong.
