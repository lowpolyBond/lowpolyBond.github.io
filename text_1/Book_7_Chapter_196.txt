Sanjaya told the story:  Drona's son, Ashwatthama, was very angry and sad.  His father, Drona, had been killed unfairly.  He cried and felt his heart burn with rage.

He told Duryodhana, "They killed my father while he wasn't fighting!  Yudhishthira tricked him!  That was a very bad thing to do.  Itâ€™s okay to die in battle, but this was not fair!  They even pulled his hair!  It's terrible that my father, a great warrior, suffered such humiliation."

Ashwatthama was furious. He said, "Yudhishthira and Dhrishtadyumna (who killed his father) will pay for this! I will avenge my father's death! I will kill Dhrishtadyumna and all the Panchala soldiers. I won't stop until I get revenge!"

Ashwatthama was a powerful warrior. He had a very special weapon, given to him by Lord Narayana himself.  Lord Narayana told Ashwatthama that this weapon was very powerful and could kill anyone.  It should only be used wisely.

Ashwatthama said, "I will use this weapon!  I will defeat all the Pandavas!  Arjuna and I are the best warriors in the world, and I'm going to show them my power!"

He shouted, "My arrows will fly like rain! I will defeat everyone! Nothing can stop me!"

The Kaurava army cheered loudly. They blew their horns and beat their drums.  The sound was so loud that the earth trembled!

The Pandavas heard the noise and talked among themselves.  They knew what was coming.  Ashwatthama, filled with grief and rage, prepared to use his powerful weapon. He touched water and called upon the Narayana weapon.  The great battle was about to begin!
