Arjuna was fighting the Danavas (bad guys!).  They threw giant rocks, like huge trees falling from the sky!  Arjuna shot them down with his amazing arrows, which were like thunderbolts.  The rocks turned to dust and fire!

Then, whoosh!  A huge waterfall came down, bigger than any river you've ever seen!  It was so stormy, Arjuna couldn't see anything! The wind roared, and the Danavas shouted.

Arjuna used a super-powerful magic weapon from the god Indra to dry up all the water.  But the Danavas weren't done! They made fake fires and winds! Arjuna put out the fires and stopped the winds with his strong arms.

Next, the Danavas made everything disappear!  It was dark, and so scary!  Arjuna's chariot driver, Matali, got scared and dropped his reins.  He cried out, "Where are you, Arjuna?"

Matali told Arjuna that even the gods had fought terrible battles like this before. He said, "Arjuna, this battle is meant to destroy the world!"

Arjuna felt a little scared, but he wasn't going to give up.  "Don't worry, Matali!" he said. "I will use my magic powers to beat them!"  Arjuna made his own magic illusions to fight back!

Suddenly, it got light again.  The bad guys kept changing things, making the world disappear and reappear, and sometimes making it look like it was underwater.  But Arjuna kept fighting!

Then, some really strong Danavas attacked, but Arjuna fought bravely and defeated many of them.  But with so many illusions, Arjuna couldn't see all the enemies. The battle was still raging!
