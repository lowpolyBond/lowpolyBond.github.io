Once upon a time, a powerful lady named Death was told by Brahma, the creator god, to kill all living things.  But Death was sad.  She didn't want to hurt anyone!

She prayed to Brahma, "I'm a woman! How can I do such a terrible thing?  I'll be so scared of being bad.  I don't want to make people cry. Please help me!"

Death asked Brahma to let her become a holy woman instead. She wanted to pray and be good. Brahma was quiet for a moment, then he smiled.  He said, "Okay, Death, you don't have to kill everyone."

Death was so happy! She became a holy woman and spent a very, very long time praying.  She prayed for billions of years!  She prayed so much that she became very thin and weak.

After all that praying, Brahma talked to her again. He said, "Death, you don't have to hurt anyone to be good. You can help people by making them sick. The sickness will make them die, but you won't be the one who did it."

Brahma also said that the sadness of dying would make people sick themselves.  The sadness was like a disease. Death was now happy. She would help things end naturally. She wouldn't be the scary one killing everyone.

Narada, a wise storyteller, told King Akampana this story. The king was sad because his son had died in battle. Narada explained that death is part of life.  Everyone dies, even gods. It's not Death's fault; it's just how things are.  It's like the wind; it just blows.

The king felt much better after hearing the story. Narada reminded him that his son was now in a happy place in heaven.  He urged the king, and all of us, to not be sad about death, because it is natural and inevitable.  Then the story ended.
