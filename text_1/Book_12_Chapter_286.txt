Once upon a time, Yudhishthira, a very wise king, asked his grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandpa, what is Adhyatma? Where does it come from?"

Bhishma smiled.  "Adhyatma helps us understand everything! It's the most important thing," he said. "Listen carefully! Everything is made of five things: Earth, air, space, water, and light.  These five things create everything and then, when things end, they go back to these five things. Imagine the ocean: waves rise from it and fall back into it.  Living things are like that too! They come from these five things and return to them."

Bhishma explained that:

* **Earth** gives things their solidness.
* **Air** gives things life.
* **Space** gives things sound.
* **Water** gives things taste.
* **Light** gives things their shape.


"The Creator," Bhishma continued, "adds other things too:  goodness (Sattwa), passion (Rajas), and darkness (Tamas), time, our ability to think, and our minds. These all live inside us, between our toes and the top of our head!"

He said we have five senses (sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch), our mind, our understanding, and our soul.  Our senses bring information to our understanding. Our mind thinks and doubts. Our understanding helps us to learn. Our soul just watches.  Good feelings come from goodness, bad feelings from passion, and confused feelings from darkness.

Bhishma explained that our understanding is like a spider spinning a web.  The web is like our thoughts and feelings. The spider, our understanding, can spin good and bad webs.  Even when the web is gone, the spider is still there.

He said, "Knowing this helps you be happy! Don't let sadness or joy control you.  Smart people understand this, and they aren't scared.  If you learn about Adhyatma, youâ€™ll be happy and wise!"  He told Yudhishthira that even if we do bad things, learning about Adhyatma can help us be better.  It's like a raft that helps us cross a scary river.
