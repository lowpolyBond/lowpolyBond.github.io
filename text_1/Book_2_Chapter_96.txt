Rama and Sita were enjoying a nice meal by the river.  Rama gave Sita some delicious roasted meat.  Suddenly, they saw a huge cloud of dust!

"Lakshmana!" Rama called. "What is that?"

The dust was from a big army marching!  Elephants, horses, and soldiers were running all over the place.  Even the forest animals were scared.

Lakshmana quickly climbed a tall tree to see what was happening.  He saw a giant army!  Lots of soldiers, elephants, horses, and chariots.  Their flags were waving.

"Rama!" Lakshmana shouted. "It's a huge army!  We need to hide Sita and get ready to fight!"

Rama said, "Lakshmana, look at the flags.  Who are they?"

Lakshmana looked closely.  "It's Bharata!" he cried. "He wants to kill us!  He's coming to take our kingdom!"

Lakshmana was very angry. He wanted to fight.  He saw Bharata's chariot under a big tree.  He wanted to kill Bharata, and even Kaikeyi, who was the reason Rama and Sita were not in their kingdom anymore.  He wanted to defeat the whole army! He was ready to fight!  He was ready to defend Rama and Sita.

"Rama," Lakshmana said, "Let's fight!  We'll win!"
