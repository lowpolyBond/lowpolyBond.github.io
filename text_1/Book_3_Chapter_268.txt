Once upon a time, in a big forest, the Pandava brothers – Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva – were seen by their enemies.  The bad king Jayadratha was scared. He saw their flags and shouted!

He saw Draupadi, the Pandavas' wife, and asked her, "Who are those five strong men? Tell me about each one!"

Draupadi smiled. She said, "You've done bad things, and now you want to know their names? It's too late! My husbands are here, and you'll all be defeated! But since you asked...

"That one with the flags that have special musical instruments, he's Yudhishthira. He's kind and fair. He's like gold, with a big nose and beautiful eyes. He always does what's right.

"The tall one, as big as a tree, with angry eyebrows, that's Bhima! He's super strong. His horses are amazing, and he never forgets an enemy!

"The next one is Arjuna. He's the best archer!  He's wise and brave.  He's kind and never does anything cruel.

"The handsome one, that's Nakula. He's smart and brave, and everyone loves him. He's really good with a sword. His brother Sahadeva is right beside him.

"And finally, Sahadeva! He's also very smart and wise and always does what is right. He's the youngest, and he's very brave.

"If you escape my husbands, you'll be very lucky!"

Then, the five Pandava brothers, angry and powerful, attacked their enemies!  They shot so many arrows that the sky seemed dark with them! The enemy army was very scared.
