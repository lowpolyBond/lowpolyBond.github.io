Yudhishthira asked his grandfather Bhishma, "Grandfather, is it true that being good and doing good things really matters?"

Bhishma said, "Yes!  If you're mean and do bad things, you'll be sad and have a hard life.  You might be poor and always scared.  It will be like being dead, even while you're alive!

But if you're kind and good, you'll be happy and lucky!  You'll have lots of good things.  It's like going to a wonderful place filled with joy!

People who aren't good wander around in scary places, like a dark forest with wild animals and robbers.  It's very dangerous.

But people who are kind and helpful, who give to others and worship the gods, have a wonderful life.  They are like sunshine.

Think of it like this:  bad things you do follow you everywhere, like your shadow. They're with you always, even when you run!

Good things are like that too. They follow you!  What you do in this life affects your next life.  It's like a plant; you plant a seed, and it grows into a flower.  If you plant a bad seed, you get a bad flower; a good seed makes a good flower.

The things you do as a baby, a kid, and a grown-up will all have an effect later. Your actions are like a trail, and they lead you to happiness or sadness.  You can't escape them!  

Just like a dirty shirt gets clean when you wash it, bad deeds can be washed away by being good and doing good things.  Then you’ll have a happy life forever.

So, don’t talk badly about others.  Be kind, helpful, and do what's good for yourself and others."
