Long ago, in a land far away, there was a great battle.  A prince named Arjuna felt scared and confused.  A wise teacher, Krishna, helped him.

Krishna said, "Arjuna, I'll tell you a secret.  You can know me completely if you focus on me and believe in me. I’m everywhere and in everything."

Krishna explained, "I am in everything: the earth, water, fire, air, sky, your mind, your thoughts, and your consciousness. That's just a small part of me! I'm also the power that keeps the whole universe together.  I’m the start and end of everything! Nothing is bigger than me. Everything is connected to me like pearls on a string."

"I'm the taste in water, the light of the sun and moon, the sound 'Om' in prayers, the courage in heroes, the smell of the earth, the heat in fire, the life in all living things."

Krishna said, "I am the seed of everything. I'm the wisdom in wise people, the strength in strong people, the good in everyone.  Even things that seem bad come from me, but I’m not *in* them, they’re *in* me."

"Many people don't know me because they’re tricked by good, bad, and confusing things. Only those who really believe in me can see past this trick."

"Good people worship me in different ways.  The best are those who truly understand me and are completely devoted. They've spent many lives trying to find me. They know I am everything."

"If you want to worship a particular god, that's okay, because everything comes from me. But knowing me brings the greatest reward. Those who don't understand, think of me as something they can see, but I am much, much bigger than that."

"I know everything, past, present, and future.  But hardly anyone really knows *me*. People are often confused, pulled between wanting things and not wanting things.  But those who are good and who have overcome their confusion, they understand and worship me. They escape death and suffering, they understand everything, and they know what is truly important."
