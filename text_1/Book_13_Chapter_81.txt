King Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather Bhishma, "Grandpa, what's the most important and holy thing in the whole world, besides what we've already talked about?"

Bhishma smiled.  "Cows, my dear boy! Cows are the most sacred. They help people get rid of bad things and sadness. Their milk is used to make special offerings, and cows help everyone in the world. There's nothing holier than a cow!  Even gods wish they could live where cows live!  Giving away cows is a wonderful thing to do.  It helps you go to a beautiful place after you die. Great kings like Mandhatri and Yayati gave away thousands of cows, and because of that, they went to amazing places, places even the gods couldn't reach!"

Bhishma then told a story.  "A long time ago, a very wise boy named Suka asked his father, the great sage Vyasa, 'What's the best thing a person can do? What helps people go to the best place after they die?'"

Vyasa answered, "Cows are very special! They help everyone!  Long ago, cows didn't have horns. But they prayed to a powerful god, and he gave them horns!  Cows are beautiful, and their milk and butter are used for important ceremonies. Giving a cow away is like giving away many good things. People who give cows away go to a wonderful place after they die.  It's a beautiful land made of gold and gems!  Lovely rivers flow there, filled with beautiful flowers and shining jewels.  Happy people live there, without any sadness or anger.  They have everything they could ever wish for! They ride on amazing vehicles, and beautiful fairies sing and dance for them. This wonderful place is ruled by powerful gods, and only those who give away cows can go there."

Vyasa also said, "You should always be kind to cows.  Never hurt them.  Show them respect.  There are special prayers you can say for cows. If you really take care of cows, they will make your wishes come true!"  Vyasa also described special things you could do with cow's milk, urine, and butter to become pure and holy. He even told of how the gods, after losing a battle, did these things and became strong again.

Bhishma finished, "Suka learned to always show respect to cows. You should do the same, my grandson."
