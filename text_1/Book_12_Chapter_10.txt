Bhima was upset with his brother, Yudhishthira.  "You're not seeing things clearly!" he said. "You're like someone who reads holy books all day but doesn't understand them!  You say we shouldn't have fought the Kauravas.  But kings have to protect their people!  Are kindness and mercy not important for a king?  If we knew you felt this way, we wouldn't have fought. We would have been beggars our whole lives! This terrible war wouldn't have happened!"

Bhima explained, "Smart people say strong people get what they want. The whole world is for the strong to enjoy.  Wise kings say enemies who try to take their kingdom should be defeated. We fought them fairly, and we won. Now, Yudhishthira, rule the kingdom well."

Bhima said, "Giving up the kingdom is like digging a well but stopping before you get water.  It’s like climbing a tree for honey, but falling before you taste it! It’s like starting a long journey and giving up halfway.  It’s like killing all your enemies, but then killing yourself! It's like being starving, getting food, and refusing to eat!  It’s like wanting a girl and then not marrying her.

"We’re strong and smart. Yet we obey you like helpless children! We help everyone, but people think we are weak and can’t achieve anything.  Think about it!  Giving up everything is only for old, weak kings or ones who lost a battle. Wise people don't think giving up is a king's job. It's even wrong for a king to do so!"

"Only poor and faithless people say a king should give up everything. Kings should be strong!  They should use their strength to protect their people and their kingdom! Only a king who can't even feed his family should live in the forest.  Animals in the forest can’t go to heaven, and neither can weak kings who only live in the forest without helping anyone.  A king must do good things! If giving up everything made you successful, then trees and mountains would be the most successful, because they always give up things and don’t harm anyone.

"If what makes someone successful depends on their own actions, then you, as a king, must act.  People who don't act never succeed. If just filling your own stomach made you successful, then all the fish would be the most successful, because they only take care of themselves. Look, everyone in the world is doing what they should be doing.  You should do what a king should do.  Don't give up!"
