One day, a big battle was happening.  Lots of soldiers were fighting!  Cars crashed, elephants trumpeted, and horses galloped.  A brave prince from Panchala was fighting three strong warriors: Aswatthaman (Drona's son), Salya, and Kripa.

The Panchala prince shot many arrows. He broke Aswatthaman's chariot, so Aswatthaman jumped into Salya's chariot to keep fighting.  Then, Abhimanyu, another brave warrior, joined the fight! He shot many arrows at Aswatthaman, Salya, and Kripa. They shot back!

Abhimanyu's cousin, Lakshmana, got angry and joined the fight too!  They fought and fought. Lakshmana even broke Abhimanyu's bow! But Abhimanyu quickly grabbed a new one.  They kept shooting arrows at each other.

Then, Duryodhana saw his son, Lakshmana, was in trouble. He rushed to help, bringing lots of other soldiers!  They surrounded Abhimanyu. But Abhimanyu was super brave and didn't get scared.

Abhimanyu's father, Arjuna, saw what was happening and rushed to help his son.  He was so angry!  Arjuna and his army came charging in, creating a huge cloud of dust.  The soldiers couldn't see! Arjuna's arrows flew everywhere!

So many soldiers were hurt or scared.  Elephants ran away, chariots crashed, and soldiers dropped their weapons and ran.  Arjuna's arrows broke bows, swords, and shields.  The battlefield was a mess!  No one could fight Arjuna!

Arjuna and his friend Krishna blew their horns.  Bhishma, an old and wise warrior, saw his army was losing badly. He told Drona, "Arjuna is too strong!  We need to stop fighting now."  The sun was setting, so both armies stopped fighting and went home.  It was the end of a very long and difficult day!
