Once upon a time, a huge army of monkeys gathered to help Rama.  Sugriva, the monkey king, called them all together.  Many monkey chiefs came, each bringing tons of monkeys!  There was Sushena with a thousand billion monkeys, Gaya and Gavakshya with a hundred billion each, and even more!  Jambuvan brought a whole bunch of bears!  The monkeys were all different sizes and colors, some big as mountains, some tiny! They roared and shouted, a crazy, exciting mess!

They were so many, they looked like a giant ocean of monkeys!  Rama and Sugriva, along with the brave Hanuman and Lakshmana, led this amazing army.  They were ready for a big adventure!  But there was a problem: the ocean!

Rama looked at the ocean. It was HUGE!  Many monkeys boasted they could swim, but Rama knew that wasn’t possible.  Some monkeys suggested boats and rafts, but Rama said, "That won't work!  The ocean is too wide!"  

Rama decided to ask the ocean god for help.  He prayed by the seashore.  The ocean god appeared!  He was a relative of Rama! The ocean god said, "I'll help! Your monkey, Nala, is a super builder. He can make a bridge!"

Nala, a strong monkey, built an amazing bridge! It was super long and wide – the best bridge ever!  Everyone called it Nala's Bridge.

While Rama was getting ready to cross, Vibhishana, Ravana’s brother, came to join Rama’s side.  Sugriva was a little scared at first, but Rama knew Vibhishana was a good guy.  He made Vibhishana his friend and advisor.

With Vibhishana's help, Rama and his army crossed the bridge to Lanka. They wrecked Ravana's gardens!  They even caught two of Ravana’s spies who were disguised as monkeys!

Finally, Rama sent Angada, another smart monkey, to talk to Ravana. The great battle was about to begin!
