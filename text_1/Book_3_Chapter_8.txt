Once upon a time, there was a wise man named Vyasa. He talked to King Dhritarashtra, the father of the Kauravas.  Vyasa said, "King, I'm worried! Your son, Duryodhana, cheated the Pandavas in a game and sent them to live in the forest for thirteen years."

"That wasn't fair!" Vyasa said.  "The Pandavas are strong and angry.  When they come back, they might be very upset and fight back. Duryodhana wants to kill them to keep the kingdom, but that's wrong!"

Vyasa explained, "Fighting your own family is bad.  It's like poison!  It's better to be peaceful.  Duryodhana is very jealous of the Pandavas.  It would be best if he went to live with them in the forest. Maybe, if they become friends, everything will be okay."

But Vyasa wasn't sure. He knew that people don't always change.  He asked the King, "What do you think?  What do Bhishma, Drona, and Vidura think? We need to do something good before it's too late!"
