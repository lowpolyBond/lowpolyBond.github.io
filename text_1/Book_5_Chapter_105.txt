Once upon a time, a powerful bird named Garuda got really angry.  King Indra, a powerful god, had given a long life to a snake named Sumukha. Garuda ate snakes for food, and now he couldn't eat Sumukha!

Garuda flew to Indra and complained, "You gave Sumukha a special gift! Now I can't eat him, and my family will starve!"  He was very upset. He told Indra how strong he was, saying, "I even carry Indra's brother on my back in battles!"

Indra was impressed but still didn't change his mind. Then,  the powerful god Vishnu heard Garuda boasting. Vishnu said, “You think you’re so strong? Carry just one of my arms!”

Garuda tried, but Vishnu's arm was so heavy, it felt like the whole Earth! Garuda fell down, exhausted.  He was covered in shame and apologized to Vishnu.  Vishnu was kind, and he let Garuda keep his food, but he made sure Garuda learned his lesson. He gently tossed Sumukha onto Garuda's chest.  From that day on, Garuda and Sumukha were friends.

A wise man named Kanwa told this story to Duryodhana, a powerful prince. Kanwa meant to teach Duryodhana a lesson about being humble and avoiding war. Kanwa said that Duryodhana’s enemies were as strong as Vishnu!  But Duryodhana just laughed and said, "What's going to happen, will happen.  I won't change my plans!"
