Long ago, some bad giants called Kalakeyas lived in the ocean.  At night, they came out and scared everyone. They were very hungry!

They went to places where wise people, called Munis, lived. The Kalakeyas ate lots of Munis!  They ate 180 Munis in one place, and 100 in another!  They even ate Munis who only ate fruits and roots, or even just air and water!  They were mean!

Every morning, people found the Munis' bodies.  The bodies were all thin and broken.  There were bones everywhere, and bits of broken pots and pans from their homes.  It was sad.  No one could stop the Kalakeyas, because they hid in the ocean during the day.

People were so scared! Some hid in caves. Some ran away.  Others were too afraid, and just died.  Some brave people tried to find the Kalakeyas, but couldn't.  The Kalakeyas were hiding deep in the ocean.

The gods were very worried.  The world was becoming a scary place! There were no happy celebrations, no prayers.  Everything was sad.

So, the gods went to a very powerful god, Narayana.  Narayana was super strong! He had saved the world before. He lifted up the earth when it sank in the ocean!  He had also defeated many other bad giants!

The gods begged Narayana, "Please help us!  These Kalakeyas are destroying everything! Please save us!"  Narayana was ready to help. He was always there to protect the good people.
