Long ago, in a happy kingdom, King Nala brought his beautiful wife, Damayanti, home.  Her father, a brave warrior, happily sent her.  Nala and Damayanti lived happily ever after, like a king and queen in a magical garden.  Nala ruled his kingdom well and had many happy celebrations.

But a long time ago, Nala had some bad luck because of a game called dice. He lost everything!  He and Damayanti had a hard time.  But Nala was brave and clever.  He got everything back!

Now, Yudhishthira, another king, was sad. He was living in the forest with his brothers.  A wise man named Vrihadaswa told him Nala's story.  Vrihadaswa said that even though life is sometimes hard, people should be brave and not give up.  He also taught Yudhishthira how to play dice well. Yudhishthira was so happy to learn this!

After Vrihadaswa left, Yudhishthira heard news about his brother Arjuna. Arjuna was doing very, very hard religious practices in the forest! He was so dedicated, eating only air!  Yudhishthira felt sad that his brother was working so hard.  He talked to wise people in the forest, trying to feel better.  The story of Nala and Damayanti, he learned, helped people feel less sad and gave them hope.
