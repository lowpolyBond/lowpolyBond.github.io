Once upon a time, there was a very holy man named Chyavana.  He was the son of a great saint, Bhrigu. Chyavana wanted to be even holier, so he went to live by a lake and did very, very hard prayers. He sat so still, he looked like a tree!  Slowly, an anthill grew around him.  He was completely covered in ants!

One day, King Saryati went to the lake with his family for a fun day.  He had lots of wives and one beautiful daughter named Sukanya.  Sukanya was playing in the woods, picking flowers.  She saw the anthill and poked it with a thorn, thinking it was a funny little bug.  Oops!  That anthill was Chyavana!

Chyavana was hurt and angry. He used his magic to make it hard for the kingâ€™s soldiers to go to the bathroom! The king was very worried. He asked everyone what happened. Nobody knew! Then Sukanya told the truth: she had poked the anthill.  

Chyavana was still angry. He told the king, "Your daughter hurt me.  To make things right, she has to marry me!" The king was shocked, but he was desperate to fix the problem.  He agreed.

Sukanya married the holy man Chyavana.  She took care of him and loved him.  She learned to be holy too.  Everyone was happy in the end, even though it started with a very surprising poke!
