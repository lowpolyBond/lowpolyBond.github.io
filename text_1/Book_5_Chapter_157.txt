Once upon a time, before a big battle, Duryodhana (the son of Dhritarashtra) talked to his grandfather, Bhishma.  Duryodhana said, "Grandpa Bhishma, a big army needs one strong leader.  If everyone is in charge, it's like a bunch of ants – all confused!  Once, some priests fought some warriors. The priests were all arguing, but the warriors followed one leader.  The warriors won! So, Grandpa, please be our leader!"

Duryodhana praised Bhishma, saying he was the best, like the sun among the stars, or the best warrior among all warriors. He begged Bhishma to lead their army to victory.

Bhishma said, "I will fight for you, but I also care about the Pandavas (their cousins).  Arjun (Dhananjaya), the Pandava warrior, is very powerful.  I could defeat anyone, even the gods, but I can't beat Arjun!  So, I'll fight, but I'll only kill ten thousand soldiers each day.  Or, Karna can fight first.  Karna is very strong, but only wants to fight after I'm gone."

Karna, a brave warrior, said, "I won't fight as long as Bhishma is alive.  Only after Bhishma is gone will I fight Arjun."

So, Duryodhana made Bhishma the leader of his army!  There was a big celebration.  Drums beat, horns blew, and everyone cheered.  But then, strange things happened:  it rained blood, the ground shook, and scary sounds filled the air.  It was a bad sign.

Despite the bad omens, Duryodhana and Bhishma, with Karna by their side, led the army to Kurukshetra, a big battlefield.  They found a perfect spot for their camp – a beautiful place with lots of grass and wood.  The camp looked as amazing as their own city, Hastinapura!
