Bhima said, "Krishna, please talk to Duryodhana nicely.  Don't make him angry. He's a grumpy guy! He's mean and bossy, and he only cares about himself. Be gentle with him."

Duryodhana is really bad. He's like a sneaky thief, always bragging and hating the Pandavas. He's cruel, doesn't listen to anyone, and never changes his mind.  It's hard to make peace with him, Krishna. He ignores good advice and does whatever he wants, like a snake hiding in the grass, ready to strike.

You know Duryodhana and his army.  Before, the Kauravas and Pandavas were happy together, like friends. But Duryodhana's anger is destroying everyone. It's like a big forest fire.  Many kings before him have done the same â€“ destroying their own families. It's like a bad thing that happens at the end of every long time period.

Duryodhana is one of those bad kings. He's like the bad guy in a story.  So, Krishna, please talk to him softly and kindly. Tell him what's right, but in a nice way. We'd rather be poor and follow Duryodhana than have a big, awful war that destroys everyone.  

Please, Krishna, ask the wise old people and Duryodhana's advisors to help make peace.  Yudhishthira and Arjuna agree.  Arjuna is kind, and he doesn't want a war.  Let's try to prevent a terrible fight, Krishna. Please!"
