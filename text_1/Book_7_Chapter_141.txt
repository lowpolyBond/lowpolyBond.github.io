Once upon a time, during a great battle, a brave warrior named Satyaki fought bravely.  Bhurisravas, a powerful warrior on the other side, saw Satyaki and got very angry.

Bhurisravas shouted, "Satyaki! You're in my sights! Today, I will defeat you!  I've always wanted this fight! You can't escape me! I'll kill you and make King Suyodhana happy.  Arjuna and Krishna will watch you fall! Even Yudhishthira will be ashamed!"

Satyaki laughed. "I'm not afraid! Your words are empty! Only the strongest warrior can defeat me. Prove your strength instead of boasting!"

Bhurisravas roared!  The two warriors clashed!  They shot arrows like a storm! It was a fierce battle, like two angry elephants fighting!  They showered each other with arrows.

Bhurisravas shot many arrows at Satyaki, but Satyaki was quick, and he cut the arrows in mid-air! The battle raged.  They fought like tigers with claws, or elephants with tusks. They fought so hard they hurt each other badly.

Then, Satyaki ran out of arrows! Bhurisravas was very strong. He knocked Satyaki off his chariot! He grabbed Satyaki’s hair and was about to kill him.

Krishna saw this and called to Arjuna, Satyaki’s friend. "Arjuna! Satyaki is in trouble!  He needs your help! He’s being attacked by Bhurisravas!"

Arjuna saw his friend in danger.  He quickly aimed his bow and shot a special arrow.  Whoosh! The arrow flew like lightning and chopped off Bhurisravas’s sword arm!  Satyaki was saved!
