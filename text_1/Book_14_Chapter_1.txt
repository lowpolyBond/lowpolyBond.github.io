After a big battle, King Yudhishthira was very sad.  He felt terrible because many people had died, including his cousins.  He sat by the river, crying. He was so upset he fell down like a tired elephant.

His brother Bhima helped him up.  Krishna, their friend, told Yudhishthira, "Don't be so sad!"

King Dhritarashtra, Yudhishthira's uncle, saw him. Dhritarashtra was very sad too, because all his sons had died in the war. He spoke to Yudhishthira.

"My dear nephew," he said, "You won the war. You are the king! You should be happy. I lost all my sons.  It’s me and my wife, Gandhari, who should be sad. I didn't listen to my wise advisor, Vidura. He told me to stop my son Duryodhana from being mean. He told me Duryodhana's bad actions would cause trouble. He told me to make you king instead.  I was a fool! I listened to Duryodhana instead. Now, look at us all – sad and heartbroken. You have no reason to be sad, my boy."  

Dhritarashtra hugged Yudhishthira. He told him to be strong and rule the kingdom well.  He said Yudhishthira deserved to be happy.
