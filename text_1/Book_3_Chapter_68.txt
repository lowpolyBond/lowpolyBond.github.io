Once upon a time, King Nala lost his kingdom. He and his queen, Damayanti, became poor.  Bhima, a powerful king, wanted to find them.

Bhima sent out many wise men, called Brahmins, to search. He promised them lots of cows, land, and even a whole village if they found Nala and Damayanti!

The Brahmins searched everywhere.  They looked in big cities and small towns. But they couldn't find Nala and Damayanti.

Finally, one Brahmin named Sudeva found Damayanti!  He found her in a faraway city. She looked sad and thin.  She wasn't wearing pretty clothes. She looked like a beautiful lotus flower covered in mud.

Sudeva knew it was Damayanti, even though she was very unhappy.  He saw how sad she was missing her husband, Nala.  He thought she looked like the moon hidden by clouds.

Sudeva told Damayanti that Bhima wanted her to come home. He told her that her family missed her very much.  Damayanti was so happy to hear from home! She cried with joy.

Sunanda, a friend who lived with Damayanti, saw her crying and told the Queen. The Queen wanted to know what was going on.

Sudeva explained everything to the Queen.  He told her about Nala and Damayanti's sad story.  The Queen was very kind and listened carefully. Now, it was time for Damayanti to go home!
