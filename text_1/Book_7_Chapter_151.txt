Sanjaya told the king, "Duryodhana was angry!  He wanted to fight. He saw Arjuna, helped only by Krishna, break through Drona's army.  It was a super strong army, even the gods couldn't break through it! Arjuna, all by himself, killed the king of Sindhu, right in front of Drona and Duryodhana!  Many kings died.  Duryodhana was upset.  He said, 'Arjuna killed so many of my best warriors! How could he do this? Drona let him in!  He promised to protect the king of Sindhu, but he didn't!  Jayadratha wanted to go home, but I stopped him.  Now all my brothers are dead!'"

Karna said, "Don't blame Drona. He fought bravely. Arjuna is very strong and fast. He's a great warrior with amazing weapons and a magic chariot. Krishna drove the chariot. Arjuna is young and full of energy.  It's not Drona's fault that Arjuna broke through. Drona is old and tired.  It's just fate.  Even though we fought hard, the king of Sindhu died. Fate is powerful. We tried tricks and fought hard, but fate stopped us.  Whatever we did, fate made it fail. Keep fighting!  Even fate might help the side that fights hardest!"

Sanjaya said, "While they talked, the Pandavas came to fight. A huge battle started!  Cars crashed, elephants fought. But it was all because of your bad plans, King!"
