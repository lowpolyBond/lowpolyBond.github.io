King Dhritarashtra asked, "Sanjaya, tell me about the great battle on the tenth day! How did Bhishma, the strong warrior, fight for the Kauravas against the Pandavas?  Tell me everything!"

Sanjaya said, "King, I'll tell you!  The Kauravas and Pandavas fought a huge battle.  Every day, Arjuna, with his powerful weapons, defeated many Kaurava warriors. But Bhishma, a very strong Kuru warrior, fought bravely and killed many Pandavas.  It was a close fight! We couldn't tell who would win.

On the tenth day, Bhishma and Arjuna fought a terrible battle. Bhishma, who knew all kinds of fighting skills, killed thousands of soldiers! He was so strong! But after ten days of fighting, Bhishma decided he didn't want to live anymore. He wanted to die fighting. He spoke to Yudhishthira, the Pandava king.

Bhishma said, 'Yudhishthira, I’m tired of fighting and killing.  If you want to make me happy, please kill me.'

Yudhishthira agreed. He told his army, 'Let's defeat Bhishma! Arjuna will protect us!  We’ll put Sikhandin in front to fight Bhishma.'

So the Pandavas attacked.  Many kings fought on both sides.  Dhrishtadyumna fought against Drona.  Bhima fought against many Kaurava soldiers.  Arjuna, with Sikhandin in front, fought against Bhishma.  The whole battlefield was full of noise and dust!  It was a terrible, noisy battle.  Soldiers fought with swords, arrows, and spears. Elephants fought elephants, soldiers fought soldiers. It was as fierce as two hawks fighting over a piece of meat!"
