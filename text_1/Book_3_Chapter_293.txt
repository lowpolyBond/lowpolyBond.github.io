King Aswapati wanted to marry his beautiful daughter, Savitri, to a good man.  He heard about a wise king, Dyumatsena, who lived in the forest with his son, Satyavan.

Aswapati traveled to the forest with many priests. He found King Dyumatsena sitting under a tree.  Aswapati bowed politely and asked if Savitri could marry Satyavan.

King Dyumatsena was sad. He had lost his kingdom and lived a simple life in the forest. He felt unworthy.  He worried that Savitri wouldn’t be happy living a hard life.

But Aswapati said, “Happiness and sadness change. Savitri and I understand this.  Please, let them marry!  You are a good king, and I am honored to ask for your son’s hand.”

King Dyumatsena agreed! He was happy to have such a kind guest. He called the forest priests, and Savitri and Satyavan were married.  Aswapati gave Savitri pretty clothes and jewelry, then went home very happy.

Savitri was very happy too, but she was also kind and thoughtful. She took off her fancy clothes and wore simple ones. She helped everyone in the forest. She took great care of her new mother-in-law, and always respected her father-in-law.  She was a loving wife to Satyavan.

They lived a simple life together in the forest, but Savitri always remembered something a wise man had told her father about her future.  She worried about it day and night.
