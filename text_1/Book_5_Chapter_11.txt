Once upon a time, all the gods and wise people wanted a new king.  They chose Nahusha, a handsome and powerful man.  They asked him to be their king.

Nahusha was humble. He said, "I'm not strong enough! Indra is the better choice."  But the gods insisted. They said, "You're strong because you're good! Rule over us!" They told him he would get even stronger, able to take the power of anyone he looked at!

So Nahusha became the king of the gods! He was good at first. He ruled wisely. But then, he changed. He loved having fun.

He lived in beautiful places, like the Nandana gardens and Mount Kailasa. He listened to beautiful music and had lots of fun with pretty celestial nymphs.  He was surrounded by amazing things.

One day, he saw Sachi, Indra's wife. He was very bossy. He demanded that she come to him!  Sachi was scared.  She ran to Vrihaspati, a wise priest, for help.

Sachi was worried.  She cried, "Vrihaspati, you always said I was a good wife! Please help me!"

Vrihaspati comforted her. He said, "Don't worry! Indra will be back soon. Nahusha can't hurt you."

But Nahusha got angry when he learned Sachi had gone to Vrihaspati. He was furious!  What will happen next?
