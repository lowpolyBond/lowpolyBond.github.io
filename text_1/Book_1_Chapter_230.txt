Once upon a time, there was a huge forest called Khandava.  Lots of animals lived there â€“ elephants, tigers, lions, deer, birds, and even scary creatures like Rakshasas (monsters) and Nagas (snakes)!

One day, a powerful fire, Agni, wanted to burn down the whole forest.  Krishna and Arjuna, two very strong warriors, helped Agni.  They were so strong that they made the forest animals very scared!  The animals ran everywhere, but the fire was getting bigger and bigger!

Krishna threw his magical discus, a spinning weapon, and it sliced through the monsters and animals.  Arjuna shot arrows that flew everywhere, hitting lots of creatures.  The animals cried out, and the forest was filled with scary sounds.

Even some gods from heaven came to try and stop the fire, but they couldn't beat Krishna and Arjuna!  They were too powerful!  One of the gods, Indra, was angry, but then a voice told him that Krishna and Arjuna were actually super powerful gods themselves, disguised as warriors!  Indra was amazed and stopped fighting.  All the gods left.

Krishna and Arjuna kept helping Agni.  The forest burned for many days!  Arjuna's arrows were so fast and accurate, he could hit hundreds of animals at once!  Many animals sadly died in the fire.

But some animals were saved! Maya, a friendly monster, was scared, but Arjuna promised to protect him, so Agni didn't burn him.  A few other animals were also saved.  Finally, the forest was gone. Agni was very happy because he had gotten a giant feast.

Afterward, Krishna and Arjuna were very happy they had helped Agni and protected their friend Maya. The great fire was finally over.
