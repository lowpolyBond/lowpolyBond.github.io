The Pandavas were hiding!  Yudhishthira, the oldest brother, made a plan.  "Let's send our priest and some cooks and drivers to Drupada's house," he said. "They'll keep our sacred fire going.  And let Indrasena and the others take the empty chariots to Dwaravati.  Draupadi's maids should go to the Panchalas too. Tell everyone we don't know where we are!"

Then, the Pandavas asked their wise teacher, Dhaumya, for advice.  Dhaumya said, "Your plans are good, but you must protect Draupadi! Remember, living with a king is tricky.  You must be very careful."

Dhaumya gave them lots of rules:  "Always ask permission to see the king.  Don't talk about his secrets. Don't take a seat someone else wants. Don't give advice unless he asks. Be quiet and respectful.  Don't be friends with the king's wife or anyone he doesn't like.  Don't do anything without the king knowing. Kings are powerful and don’t forgive easily!"

Dhaumya continued, "Always be polite and helpful to the king.  Tell him what's good and helpful, even if it's not fun to say. Never be rude. Always think, 'The king might not like me,' so work hard. Don't get too friendly with his enemies. Don't act smarter than the king. Be cheerful, brave, honest, and calm. If the king asks you to do something, say, 'Yes, I will!'"

Dhaumya also said,  "Don't dress like the king. Don’t laugh too loudly. Don't tell anyone the king’s secrets. Never take bribes. Always use what the king gives you. Behave yourselves this year, and you'll get your kingdom back."

Yudhishthira said, "Thank you, wise Dhaumya! Only our mother and Vidura are as wise as you!"

Dhaumya helped them leave.  He lit their sacred fire and prayed for their success.  The Pandavas went on their way, with Draupadi in front.  Dhaumya went to the Panchalas with the fire.  Indrasena and the others went to see the Yadavas, looking after the Pandavas’ chariots.  They all stayed hidden and safe.
