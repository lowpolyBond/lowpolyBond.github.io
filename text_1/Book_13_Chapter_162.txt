Long ago, in the land of Bharat, a great king named Yudhishthira asked the wise Bhishma a very important question.  He wanted to know what was more important: what you see with your own eyes, or what the holy books say.

Bhishma smiled. “That’s a good question,” he said. “It's easy to be confused! Some people think only what they see is real.  But that's not always true.  Understanding the truth takes a long time and lots of practice.”  Bhishma explained that true wisdom comes from a long journey of learning and self-control, like practicing yoga. Only those who truly search can understand the biggest truths.  He said that knowledge just from thinking isn't as good as the real knowledge that comes from deep understanding.

Yudhishthira then asked about different ways to be good.  He wondered if seeing good things, thinking about good things, reading holy books, or just *doing* good things were all equally important.

Bhishma said, “Sometimes bad people try to stop good people from doing good. But goodness always wins in the end, even if it takes a while.”  He explained that sometimes good actions can hide bad things, like grass covering a hole.  Because of this, it’s hard to always know what is truly good.

Bhishma said that the best way to know what is right is to listen to the wise people who follow the holy books and are happy and peaceful. These people are the best guides.

Yudhishthira was still confused.  He felt like he was lost at sea, searching for the shore. He didn’t understand if there were different kinds of “goodness.”

Bhishma explained that even though goodness is one big thing, we can look at it in three different ways: actions, thoughts, and the teachings of the holy books.  But he said not to worry too much about figuring out all the details.  Just follow these simple rules:  Don’t hurt others, be truthful, forgive, and be kind.  Respect the wise people, especially the Brahmins.  Treat everyone fairly.

Yudhishthira then asked what happens to good people and bad people.

Bhishma said, “Bad people who are mean and selfish go to a bad place after they die. Good people who are kind and truthful go to a happy place.  Good people always show respect to their teachers and try their best to be good.”  He added that very good people, even those who deny themselves many things, reach a special kind of happiness.

Yudhishthira asked what good and bad people look like and what they do.

Bhishma described good people as kind, well-behaved, and clean. He told Yudhishthira of several ways to show respect and live a good life – respecting elders, offering food to guests, never talking badly of anyone, and so on.  He explained the importance of prayer, giving to others, and respecting sacred things.  He talked about how to properly treat people, animals, and oneself.  He said that sin hides in our hearts and it's better to admit our mistakes than try to hide them. It's best to be truly good rather than just pretending to be.   And always remember, the most important thing is to always try to be good and kind in your heart.
