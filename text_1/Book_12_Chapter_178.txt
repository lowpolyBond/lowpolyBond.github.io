Once upon a time, the wise Bhishma told a story to King Yudhishthira. He said, "Long ago, King Janaka was very rich.  He had a huge kingdom! But he said, 'Even if my whole kingdom burned down, I wouldn't be sad.  True happiness isn't about things.'"

Bhishma continued, "Another wise man, Vodhya, was asked the secret to peace.  He said, 'I follow six simple rules. They are my teachers.'  Vodhya’s teachers were very unusual!

"First, he learned from Pingala, a bird. Pingala was happy because he didn’t want anything. Other birds fought over food, but Pingala was peaceful.

"Second, he learned from an osprey.  Osprey often fight over fish. But one wise osprey didn’t hunt, and so he lived peacefully.

"Third, he learned from a snake. The snake was happy living in someone else's hole instead of building his own. Building your own house can bring worries.

"Fourth, he learned from forest bees.  Bees live simply, sharing the forest's bounty without fighting.  They live peaceful lives.

"Fifth, he learned from a shaft-maker. This man was so focused on his work that he didn't even notice the king walk by. He was peaceful because he was focused on something good and helpful.

"Sixth, he learned from a girl. She wore a beautiful anklet.  Vodhya was like that anklet—all alone, but happy."

Bhishma smiled. "Hoping for things makes us unhappy, King Yudhishthira.  True happiness comes from not wanting too much.  Be like the peaceful bird, snake, bee, shaft-maker, and girl. Be happy with what you have, and you'll live a peaceful life, just like Vodhya."
