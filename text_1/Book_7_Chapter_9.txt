King Dhritarashtra was very sad.  His friend, Drona, a great warrior, had been killed in battle.  He asked his advisor, Sanjaya, "How could such a strong warrior be defeated? Did his chariot break? Did his bow snap? Was he not careful enough?"

Drona was incredibly skilled. He could shoot arrows very far. He was brave and never gave up. He was a teacher to many princes.  Dhritarashtra couldn't understand how Drona, who was so powerful, could die.

He wondered if Drona's strong horses got tired.  He wondered if Drona's many friends deserted him.  Dhritarashtra said, "Drona was like a great mountain! How could he fall?"

Sanjaya explained that many warriors, led by Dhrishtadyumna, surrounded Drona.  Arjuna, a very skilled archer, protected Dhrishtadyumna.  They attacked Drona while he was busy fighting.  It was a difficult battle, with many brave warriors fighting on both sides.

Dhritarashtra was heartbroken. He said, "Drona was like the ocean! He was wise and good. Even though he fought for my sons, he was a great man.  It seems fate was stronger than even his great strength."  He was so upset he had to stop talking for a while.
