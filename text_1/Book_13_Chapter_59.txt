King Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandpa, what's the best gift of all?"

Bhishma smiled.  "The best gifts show love and kindness," he said.  "Helping someone in trouble, giving someone what they need, and giving without expecting anything back – those are the best gifts.  Giving gold, cows, or land is also good; it washes away bad deeds."

"But," Bhishma continued, "the truly special gifts are given to those who really deserve them.  Give to good people who don't ask for things.  Give your best to those who are truly needy, even if they are your enemies. Imagine how wonderful it would be to feed a hungry, wise person who has nothing. And help those who are sad, even if they don't ask for help.

"Beware of people who are always asking for gifts and don’t say thank you," Bhishma warned. "They are like poisonous snakes!  Give to them too, to protect yourself.  But also give to the good people who are quiet and happy, even if they have little. Give them nice homes, clothes, and servants. Give without wanting anything in return.  Good people should give because it’s the right thing to do."

Bhishma explained, "Giving to these good people is like performing a special sacrifice. It's even better than any other sacrifice. It brings you good fortune in this life and the next. People who are kind and don't want anything for themselves are the best to help.  They are like shining lights.  They should be treated with the highest respect."

"Kings," Bhishma said, "should always honor wise people, especially Brahmins (wise teachers). They are more important than anything, even more important than me!  Serve them with respect and let them live happily.  Serving wise people is our most important duty, like a wife’s duty is to serve her husband. If wise people leave us because we don't respect them, our lives will be empty."

"A long time ago," Bhishma said, "everyone respected wise people.  Kshatriyas (warriors) served them, and everyone else served those above them. Wise people are like a bright fire.  Even powerful warriors become weak around them."  Bhishma smiled, "Serving wise people has brought me great happiness, and will help me reach a beautiful place after I die."
