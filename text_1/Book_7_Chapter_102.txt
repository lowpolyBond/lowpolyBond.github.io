Once upon a time, in a great battle, Duryodhana, a powerful king, attacked Arjuna, a brave warrior.  He shot three sharp arrows at Arjuna, then four more at Arjuna's horses!  He even hit Arjuna's friend, Krishna, ten times!  He even knocked Krishna's whip to the ground!

Arjuna, very calm, shot back many arrows.  But Duryodhana was wearing special armor!  All Arjuna’s arrows bounced off!

Krishna was surprised. "Arjuna," he said, "your arrows aren't working! Is your bow broken? Is this the end?"

Arjuna explained, "Krishna, Duryodhana's armor is magical!  It was made by Drona, a great warrior.  Even gods couldn't pierce it!"  Arjuna knew this armor was very, very strong.  But he wasn't scared. He said, "I will still win!"

Arjuna tried again, but Duryodhana's son, Ashwatthama, cut Arjuna's arrows in half! Arjuna told Krishna, "I can only use this special weapon once. If I try again, I might hurt myself!"

Duryodhana then shot many arrows at Krishna and Arjuna.  Arjuna's friends cheered.  Arjuna looked at Duryodhana.  He couldn't find a spot on Duryodhana that wasn't covered by the armor.

So Arjuna cleverly shot arrows at Duryodhana's horses, his driver, and then broke Duryodhana's bow and shield.  He even hit Duryodhana's hands!  Many soldiers rushed to help Duryodhana.  Arjuna fought them all!  The battle was so big, you couldn't see the chariots!

Krishna shouted to Arjuna, "Blow your horn and let’s end this!"  Arjuna shot many more arrows, and Krishna blew his conch shell very loudly.  The sound was so powerful, all the enemy soldiers fell down!

Arjuna's chariot was free, and he saw Jayadratha's army coming.  They all shouted and blew their horns!  Arjuna and Krishna blew theirs too, and the sounds shook the whole world! The enemy soldiers were scared, but then they attacked again! The battle was amazing!
