Arjuna, the great warrior, fought bravely.  He zoomed around the battlefield like a fast planet!  He shot so many arrows!  His arrows were different shapes â€“ some were wide, some sharp like knives, some curved like moons.  Soldiers, horses, and elephants fell dead.

Thousands of brave warriors attacked Arjuna. It was a huge, scary battle, like the gods fighting long ago!  One enemy hit Arjuna with three sharp arrows, like poisonous snakes. But Arjuna quickly cut off the enemy's head!

The other warriors attacked him with all their weapons. It was like a big storm! But Arjuna fought back!  He broke chariots, cut ropes, and even smashed the wheels of enemy war carts!  The broken chariots looked like houses destroyed by fire and wind.  Elephants fell down like buildings hit by lightning. Horses and their riders fell to the ground, hurt and bleeding.

Arjuna was strong like a god!  He kept fighting.  He killed so many enemies! Even though some of his enemies were good and kind, they went to heaven after dying in battle.

More and more soldiers rushed at Arjuna, but he was too fast. He shot arrows like the wind, destroying all their weapons!  It looked like he was crossing a huge ocean of enemies!

Krishna, Arjuna's friend, told him, "Arjuna, you're doing great, but we need to kill Karna now!"

Arjuna fought even harder.  He was so fast that no one could even see him shoot his arrows!  Krishna was amazed. Arjuna's arrows were like white swans diving into the water, quickly hitting the enemy.

Krishna showed Arjuna the battlefield.  It was a terrible sight!  Broken chariots, dead soldiers, horses, and elephants lay everywhere.  The ground was covered in weapons, armor, and blood. It looked so beautiful and terrible at the same time.

Then they heard a loud noise from the enemy army.  Arjuna, still fighting, destroyed them one by one, just like a god destroying evil.  He was a powerful warrior, destroying many enemies with his arrows.  He was amazing and unstoppable!
