The Pandavas were hiding in the kingdom of Virata.  King Yudhishthira was a clever gambler. He played dice with King Virata's men and won lots of money.  He shared the money with his brothers.

Bhima, the strongest, was the king's cook. He secretly sold the king's food to his brothers. Arjuna, the best archer, worked in the palace and gave his brothers the money he earned.  Sahadeva, a great shepherd, gave his brothers milk and butter. Nakula, a skilled horseman, took care of the king's horses and got rewarded for it.  Poor Draupadi helped everyone, keeping their secret safe.

They lived like this for three months. Then, a big festival came!  Strong wrestlers came from everywhere. One wrestler was super strong! No one could beat him.  The king asked Bhima, who was secretly the strongest, to wrestle him.

Bhima didn't want to, but he had to obey the king.  He wrestled the strong man, whose name was Jimuta. They were both so strong, it was like watching two elephants fight! They punched, kicked, and threw each other.  It was an amazing fight! Finally, Bhima was too strong. He spun Jimuta around and around until he was dizzy, then gently put him down.  Jimuta was knocked out!  The king was so happy, he gave Bhima lots of gifts.

Bhima then fought tigers and lions too!  Arjuna made everyone happy with his singing and dancing. Nakula showed off his amazing horses. Sahadeva showed the king his great herd of cows. Draupadi felt sad seeing her brothers working so hard, but she helped them stay safe.  The Pandavas lived secretly, serving King Virata, waiting for the right time to return home.
