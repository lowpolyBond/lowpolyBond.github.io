King Yudhishthira asked a big question: "Grandpa Bhishma, what god should someone worship to be happy and go to heaven? How can someone become free from all worries?  What happens after you die? How do you stay in heaven forever? Who is the most important god of all?"

Bhishma said, "That's a very hard question, my boy!  It's a secret that's very, very old.  I need help to answer it. Only with the help of Narayana (a very powerful god) can I tell you!"

Bhishma told Yudhishthira a story.  Long ago, in a time called the Krita age, Narayana, the soul of the universe, was born in four forms: Nara, Narayana, Hari, and Krishna. Nara and Narayana were very special. They went to a place called Vadari in the Himalayas and did very, very hard exercises to become even better.  They were so good that even the gods couldn't look at them!

Narada, a wise man, heard about them and wanted to see them. He flew on his special bird and found them. He wondered, "Who do these amazing gods worship?"

Narada went to Nara and Narayana. After they finished their prayers, Narada asked them, "Who is the most important god? Who do you pray to?"

Narayana said, "This is a big secret!  But because you are so devoted to me, I will tell you.  There is a tiny, invisible, powerful being inside everyone.  This is the Kshetrajna, the true self.  It's bigger than anything else.  We pray to the Kshetrajna.  It's the spirit that connects everything.  It's the father, mother, and teacher of everyone. It's even older than the first gods!"

Narayana explained that many gods and goddesses came from this Kshetrajna, including powerful beings like Brahma and Manu.  These early gods followed rules and learned from the Kshetrajna. 

Narayana said, "People who understand and worship the Kshetrajna are free.  They don't worry. They live happily, and they become one with this great spirit. Thatâ€™s the best thing that can happen."  

And so Narada learned the great secret.  He knew now who was the most important god of all.
