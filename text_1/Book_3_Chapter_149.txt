Bhima was amazed! He'd met Hanuman, the mighty monkey.  "I won't leave until you show me your real size!" Bhima demanded.

Hanuman smiled.  With a whoosh, he grew HUGE!  He was taller than any tree, bigger than the whole grove! He was as tall as the Vindhya mountains! His eyes glowed like copper, and his teeth were sharp. He swished his long tail, covering everything around him.

Bhima's hair stood on end! He was so amazed by Hanuman's enormous size that he closed his eyes.  "That's big enough," Hanuman chuckled.  "I can get even bigger if I want! In battle, I get super strong!"

Bhima was speechless. He wondered how someone so small could be so unbelievably giant.  "You could have easily destroyed Lanka all by yourself!" Bhima exclaimed.

Hanuman nodded. "I could have killed Ravana, the evil king," he said, "But then Rama wouldn't get the credit for saving Sita.  He had to do it himself to be a hero."

Then Hanuman helped Bhima. "Follow this path," he said, "It will lead you to a magical forest with beautiful flowers.  But don't just take them!  The gods need respect.  Pray to them and show them gratitude. Everyone has a job to do.  Brahmins study and teach, Kshatriyas like you protect people, Vaisyas trade and farm, and Shudras serve.  You must follow your duty as a Kshatriya. Be brave, but also be fair. Be kind, but punish the wicked.  Listen to wise people.  Be a good king.  If you do your duty, you'll go to a wonderful place when you die."  And with that, Hanuman helped Bhima on his way.
