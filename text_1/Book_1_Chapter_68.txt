Once upon a time, a king named Janamejaya wanted to hear a story.  He asked a wise man, a Brahmin, to tell him about the Kuru family,  a very important family in ancient India.

The Brahmin, whose name was Vaisampayana, began the story. He said the Kurus started with a powerful king called Dushmanta.  Dushmanta was super strong and ruled a huge kingdom.  His land stretched as far as the ocean in every direction!

Dushmanta's kingdom was amazing.  Everyone was good and kind.  There was no stealing, no sickness, and no hunger. The land was so rich, it grew food all by itself! People were happy doing their jobs, and they weren't greedy.  The rain came at just the right time, so the crops grew big and juicy. The land was full of animals and treasures.  Even the priests were honest and good.

King Dushmanta was incredibly strong! He could even lift the giant Mandara mountain, with all its trees and bushes, and hold it up with his arms!  He was a master with his mace, a kind of heavy club, and he was great at fighting with any weapon. He was brave like the god Vishnu, bright like the sun, calm like the ocean, and patient like the earth.

Everyone loved King Dushmanta. He was a wonderful king, and his people were very happy.  That's how the story of the Kuru family began.
