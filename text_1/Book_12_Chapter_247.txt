Suka, a wise young boy, asked his grandfather, Vyasa, a very, very wise man,  "Grandpa, tell me more about Adhyatma! What is it, and where does it come from?"

Vyasa smiled. "Adhyatma is like this, my dear boy," he said. "Everything is made of five things: earth, water, fire (light), air (wind), and space. Think of the ocean – it's all water, but it has lots of different waves.  These five things are like that – they're all one, but they make up everything differently.  Imagine a tortoise pulling its legs in and out of its shell.  These five things are like that too, hiding and showing themselves in all sorts of creatures and things."

Suka asked, "But Grandpa, how do these five things make up everything differently?  How can we tell what's what?"

Vyasa said, "Let me explain!  Space makes sound and our ears and the hollow parts of our bodies. Air makes our breath, how we move, and our sense of touch. Light makes our sight, our eyes, and the fire in our stomachs. Water makes our taste, our tongues, and our body fluids. Earth makes our sense of smell, our noses, and our bodies.  See, it all comes from these five things!"

"But Grandpa," Suka said, "what about our minds?  And what makes us happy, sad, or sleepy?"

Vyasa said, "That's a great question! We have five senses – sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch.  Our mind is like a sixth sense, always thinking and wondering.  Then there's our understanding, which helps us figure things out. And finally, there's our soul, which watches everything.

"And our feelings?" Vyasa continued. "There are three qualities:  Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas.  Sattwa makes us happy, peaceful, and calm. Rajas makes us angry, greedy, or boastful. Tamas makes us sleepy, lazy, and confused.  These qualities are in everyone, good and bad."

Vyasa explained that just like the tortoise, our understanding creates our senses, and then pulls them back in. Our understanding is at the center of everything that we are, all our actions, and all our feelings, happy or sad, good or bad.  The soul simply watches all of this happen.  

"So, Suka," Vyasa finished, "everything is connected.  It all comes from these five things, and how those things mix together to create our senses, our minds, our feelings, and everything in the world!"
