Once upon a time, in a land far away, a wise teacher named Kapila was talking to a man named Syumarasmi. Kapila said that some people, called Yatis, choose a simple life. They don't chase after things that will end. Instead, they learn about the world and become wise.  They are happy and free from worry.

Syumarasmi disagreed. He said that everyone needs a home and family. He said that everything good starts with families.  Animals need mothers, and all other ways of life depend on families.  Even plants depend on the earth!  Families are important for making sacrifices and helping each other.  Syumarasmi believed that the best way to live was to have a family and follow the ancient teachings, called the Vedas.

Kapila explained that the Vedas teach about good actions like helping others, and that these lead to good things. But he also said that those who are truly wise learn to control their desires. They don't get angry, they are honest, and they are kind. They control their bodies and minds.

Syumarasmi still wondered.  He asked, "The Vedas sometimes say 'do this,' and other times say 'don't do that'! Which is right?"

Kapila answered, "The best way is to learn about the world and find peace within yourself. Doing good things is important, but true happiness is found through understanding."

Syumarasmi said, "But I don't understand!  People like you seem happy even though you don't always follow all the rules in the Vedas. What is this 'peace' you talk about?"

Kapila said, "It's about understanding that everything is connected.  It's about controlling your anger, your greed, your pride, and your desires.  It’s like opening the right doors to the inside of you. There are four doors: your hands, your mouth, your stomach, and your heart. Controlling those doors leads to inner peace.  It's a hard path, but it leads to real and lasting happiness."

Syumarasmi, still puzzled, asked, "If this peaceful life is so hard, why bother?  Aren’t families and good deeds just as important?"

Kapila replied, "Both are important.  But true happiness comes from understanding the world and finding peace within. It is by controlling these four doors that we attain peace. It’s a difficult path and needs devotion, but its rewards are eternal."  The conversation continued as both men tried to understand the best way to live.
