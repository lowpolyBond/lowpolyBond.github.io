Long ago, in the city of Ayodhya, lived Prince Rama.  Everyone loved him! He was kind and good, like the sun.  Rama had to go live in the forest.  Even though his father, the king, told him to go, lots of people followed him.

They cried and begged Rama not to leave.  They loved him so much!  Rama was sad to see them so upset. He told them, "Please love my brother Bharata as much as you love me. He will be a good king."

But the people still followed him. It was like they were tied to him with an invisible rope!  Even old, wise people ran after him. They pleaded with Rama's horses to turn back!  They cried, “Please go back to the city!”

Rama stopped his chariot. He got out and walked, slowly, towards the forest.  The old people walked with him, too.  They carried their holy things and said, "We will come with you! You are good and kind.  If you don't follow what's right, who will?"

Even the trees and birds seemed sad.  The trees bowed their branches, wanting Rama to stay. The birds just sat still, not even looking for food.  The river Tamasa seemed to stop Rama, too.

Finally, Rama’s driver, Sumantra, let the tired horses rest by the river. He gave them water and let them eat grass.  Rama, with his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana, continued their journey into the forest.  Many people still followed him, their hearts heavy with sadness.
