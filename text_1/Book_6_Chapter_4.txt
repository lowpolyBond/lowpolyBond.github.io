King Dhritarashtra was sad.  Wise Vyasa had just told him about the big war coming.  Dhritarashtra sighed. He asked his friend Sanjaya, "Sanjaya, all these kings are fighting! They want the land, even if it means dying.  Why is this land so important?"

Sanjaya said, "King, let me tell you about the earth.  Everything lives on the earth.  Animals live on the earth,  and people live on the earth. There are many kinds of animals, some that live in the wild like lions and tigers, and some that we keep like cows and horses.  Plants grow from the earth too – big trees, small bushes, and even tiny grasses. Everything comes from the earth and goes back to it. The earth is the home of all living things, and it's always there. Whoever controls the land, controls everything!"

Sanjaya continued, "Think of it like this: all these animals need to eat to live.  Some animals eat plants, some animals eat other animals. It’s the same with people – we all need the earth to live."

"The earth is so important," Sanjaya finished, "that kings fight and even die for it."
