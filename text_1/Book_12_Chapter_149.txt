Once upon a time, there was a bird catcher.  He saw a pair of pigeons flying in a magical chariot!  He was sad because he caught birds for a living.  He wanted to go to heaven, just like the pigeons.

He decided to change his life.  He stopped eating normal food. He only ate air! He went on a long, hard journey. He found a beautiful lake, but he didn't even stop for a drink!  He walked into a scary forest filled with sharp thorns.  He got hurt and scratched, but he kept going.

Then, a big forest fire started! The fire was huge and scary! The bird catcher was happy. He ran into the fire!  The fire burned away all his bad deeds.

He went to heaven! He was happy and shiny, like a king! The pigeons went to heaven too, because they were good.

This is a story about how even someone who did bad things can become good and go to heaven.  If you listen to this story, you will be safe and happy, and you'll always be kind to others, just like the bird catcher learned. It's also important to help those who need your help, because even a bad person can change if they help others.
