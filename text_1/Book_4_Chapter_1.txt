Once upon a time, the Pandava brothers were in trouble.  The evil Duryodhana wanted to hurt them.  They had to hide for a year.  Yudhishthira, the eldest brother, asked Arjuna, the brave one, "Where can we hide so nobody finds us?"

Arjuna said, "Many places are safe.  We could go to Panchala, Chedi, or even Matsya!" He named lots of kingdoms.

Yudhishthira chose the kingdom of Matsya, ruled by King Virata.  He knew Virata was kind and liked the Pandavas. "We will hide in Virata's city," he said.  "But how will we hide?"

Then Yudhishthira had a plan!  "I will pretend to be a Brahmin named Kanka," he said. "I'll be a clever games player, and I'll entertain King Virata."  He would play games with pretty ivory pieces and colorful dice.

He asked Bhima, his strong brother, "What will you do, Bhima?"

We'll find out what Bhima, Arjuna, and the others did in the next part of the story!
