King Dhritarashtra was very worried. He couldn't sleep.  He was scared about the future. He asked his wise uncle, Vidura, "Vidura, I'm so worried!  What should I do? You're so smart; tell me what's best for my sons and the Kurus."

Vidura said, "Even if you didn't ask, I'd tell you the truth. I want what's best for the Kurus.  Listen carefully: Don't do anything unfair to win.  Smart people don't get upset if things don't go their way, as long as they tried their best. Before doing anything, think:  Can we do it? Is it the right thing to do? What will happen? Don't rush into things!"

Vidura explained, "A king needs to be fair and wise.  He should know when to fight and when to make peace, and how much land, money, and soldiers he has. He needs to be in control of himself.  Imagine your body is a chariot, your soul is the driver, and your senses are the horses. If the horses (your senses) are well-trained, your journey (life) will be smooth and peaceful. But if they're wild, they'll lead you to trouble!"

He continued, "Anger and greed are like a strong fish breaking through a net. They stop you from being wise.  To win, be fair and good, and control your anger, greed, and other bad feelings.  If you try to fight others without first controlling yourself, you'll lose.  Even good people can get hurt if they spend too much time with bad people.  Bad people are always selfish. They are not truthful, kind, or patient."

Vidura said, "It's hard to control what you say.  Kind words help people; bad words hurt people deeply. A wound from a sword heals, but a hurtful word can wound your heart forever.  People who lose, often do so because they've lost control of themselves."

Vidura looked at the king and said, "King, your sons are blinded by their hatred for the Pandavas.  Yudhishthira, your oldest grandson, is kind and wise.  He should be king. He is the best choice for your kingdom."
