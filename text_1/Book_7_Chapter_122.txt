Once upon a time, in a great battle, Duhsasana, a warrior on the wrong side, attacked Satyaki, a brave warrior on the good side.  Duhsasana shot lots and lots of arrows at Satyaki.  But Satyaki didn't move! He was as strong and steady as a mountain.

Duhsasana kept shooting, shouting, and making a big fuss.  He even hit Satyaki's horses and driver!  But Satyaki still fought bravely.

Then, another warrior, Madhava, saw what was happening.  He was very angry! He shot so many arrows that he made Duhsasana and his chariot disappear!  It was like magic!

Duhsasana's friends ran away scared.  But Duhsasana stayed to fight.  King Duryodhana, Duhsasana's brother, sent in a huge army to help.

Satyaki was amazing! He fought and defeated 500 soldiers by himself.  The battlefield was messy with broken chariots, dead horses, and fallen soldiers. It looked like a field of flowers, but the flowers were made of blood.

The soldiers ran away, scared like little mice.  Duhsasana then shot more arrows at Satyaki.  Satyaki shot back, hitting Duhsasana hard!  They kept shooting arrows at each other, back and forth.

Finally, Satyaki broke Duhsasana's bow, his chariot, and even hit his driver!  Duhsasana had nothing left to fight with!  He was rescued by his friends. Satyaki could have killed him, but he remembered a promise made by another warrior, Bhima.  Bhima wanted to fight Duhsasana himself. So, Satyaki let Duhsasana go and went to find another warrior, Arjuna.  The battle went on!
