King Dhritarashtra had a wonderful night chatting with his wise friends.  The next morning, everyone was excited!  All the princes and important people rushed to the beautiful court.  It was a huge, bright hall, shining like the moon, all clean and sparkly with special water.  There were amazing seats made of gold, wood, marble, and ivory, all covered with beautiful cloths.

Lots of important people were there:  Bhishma, Drona, Kripa, and many more brave kings.  Even Vidura, the very wise man, was there!  Then, on the other side, came Duryodhana and his brothers.  They were not as nice as the others.  The hall was full of powerful warriors, like a cave full of lions!

Everyone sat down. Then, a special announcement!  "The messenger is back!"  It was Sanjaya, who had raced back from the Pandavas in a fast chariot.

Sanjaya said, "I went to the Pandavas.  They sent their best wishes to everyone!  They bowed to the older people, and showed respect to everyone, just the way you should."  Then Sanjaya told everyone what he had said to the Pandavas.
