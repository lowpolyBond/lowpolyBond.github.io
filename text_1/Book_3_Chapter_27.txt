The Pandavas, including Krishna, were sad. They were living in the forest because they'd been tricked.  Krishna talked to Yudhishthira.

"King Yudhishthira," Krishna said, "Duryodhana and his friends are very mean! They don't feel sorry for us at all! They made you and us live in the forest dressed in deer skins!  His heart is like stone!  He didn't even feel bad about being so mean to you, his own brother.  He's celebrating with his friends while you're suffering.  Almost everyone cried when you left for the forest. Only Duryodhana, Karna, Sakuni, and Dussasana didn't cry!"

Krishna looked at Yudhishthira's simple bed made of grass. "You used to sleep on an ivory bed, surrounded by jewels! Now you're here, covered in dirt! You used to wear beautiful white clothes, now you wear rags! You used to feed thousands of people delicious food from golden plates!  Now, you eat whatever you can find in the woods.  Your brothers, who used to eat the tastiest food, now eat simple forest food. They are sad too!"

Krishna continued, "Bhima is the strongest warrior! He could defeat everyone! But he is sad and waits for you to act. Arjuna, the greatest archer,  could defeat armies single-handedly! He's sad, too, and waits for you. Nakula and Sahadeva, your brave, handsome brothers, are also suffering in the forest! And me, I am sad too!  You are the best of all the brothers, why aren't you angry?"

Krishna explained, "A true warrior, a Kshatriya, should be angry when they're treated unfairly. You shouldn't forgive Duryodhana and his friends. You are strong! You can defeat them! But if you're always forgiving, people will disrespect you."
