Once upon a time, a wise Brahmin (a holy man) went on a long journey. He walked through pretty forests, past sparkling lakes, and near holy rivers.  He finally reached the home of a very special snake, a Naga!

He asked a friendly hermit how to get there, and the hermit gave him directions.  The Brahmin knocked on the Naga's door and called out, "Hello! Is anyone home? I'm a Brahmin, and I'm here to visit!"

A beautiful Naga lady answered the door. She was very kind and welcoming.  She bowed to the Brahmin and asked, "What can I do for you?"

The Brahmin said, "Thank you for your kindness. My journey was long and tiring, but your words have made me feel better.  I've come all this way to meet your husband, the Naga."

The Naga lady said, "Oh, my husband is away. He's helping the sun god pull his chariot. He'll be gone for a month, but he'll be back in fifteen days. Is there anything else I can do for you?"

The Brahmin replied, "No, thank you.  I'll wait for your husband in the forest nearby. Please tell him I've come to see him when he returns.  And please let me know when he's back."

So, the Brahmin went to live by the Gomati River, eating simple food and patiently waiting for the Naga to come home. He knew it would be worth the wait!
