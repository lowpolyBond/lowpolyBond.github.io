Arjuna asked Krishna, "Krishna, what happens to people who don't follow the rules in the holy books but still pray and do good things?  Is it good, bad, or somewhere in between?"

Krishna smiled. "Arjuna," he said, "people's faith comes in three kinds, just like there are three kinds of everything!  It depends on what kind of person they are.  Some people are good, some are passionate, and some are dark."

"Good people," Krishna explained, "pray to the gods. Passionate people pray to Yakshas and Rakshasas (magical beings). And dark people pray to ghosts and spirits."

"Some people try to be holy in a bad way," Krishna continued. "They hurt themselves, and are proud and mean. They don't really understand what they're doing.  These people are not good; they're like demons!"

"Even food is of three kinds," Krishna said. "Good food makes you healthy and happy. It tastes good and is full of energy. Passionate people like bitter, spicy, or too-hot food that makes them feel bad. Dark people eat rotten or dirty food."

"The same is true for prayers, good deeds, and gifts," Krishna explained. "Good prayers are done because it’s the right thing to do, not for rewards. Passionate prayers are done to show off or get something in return. Dark prayers are wrong and don’t follow the rules."

"Good deeds are done selflessly," Krishna said. "Passionate deeds are done for praise.  Dark deeds are done to hurt others or are done in a mean way."

"Good gifts are given freely to those in need. Passionate gifts are given expecting something back. Dark gifts are given to the wrong people at the wrong time."

Krishna then told Arjuna about three special words: OM, TAT, and SAT.  He said, "OM is used to start prayers, good deeds, and gifts. TAT means doing things without wanting anything in return.  SAT means being good and true.  Everything good is SAT.  If you do anything without faith, it’s not SAT, and it’s not good."
