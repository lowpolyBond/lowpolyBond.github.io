Once upon a time, the gods decided to have a big party!  They prepared a special feast, like a super-duper birthday party.  They made sure everyone got a piece of the cake, except for one important god: Rudra, also known as Mahadeva.

Rudra was upset. He felt left out.  So, he made a HUGE bow! He used special magic to make it.  This bow was super powerful.

When the gods saw Rudra coming, they were scared! The earth shook, the wind stopped, and even the sun and moon looked sad. Rudra's bow was so powerful that he accidentally ruined the party!  He was so angry that he even hurt some other gods a little bit.

The gods were very sorry. They begged Rudra to forgive them.  Rudra, even though he was very angry, eventually calmed down. He fixed everything, gave the other gods their things back, and made the party fun again.  The gods were so happy they gave Rudra the best part of the feast!

The story teaches us that even powerful gods can get angry, but it's important to be kind and share.  And sometimes, even when things seem bad, they can get better if everyone tries to be nice. That's why it's important to share and not leave anyone out!
