Once upon a time, in a great battle, Bhima, a strong Pandava warrior, charged into the enemy's lines!  Drona, a powerful teacher, tried to stop him with a rain of arrows.  But Bhima was like a superhero! He dodged the arrows and fought bravely.

Lots of kings, urged on by Duryodhana's sons, tried to surround Bhima.  But Bhima roared like a lion! He swung his mighty mace, a super-strong club.  *BOOM!* The mace crashed into the enemy soldiers, making a huge noise.  The ground shook!  Scared, the soldiers ran away like deer from a tiger.

Bhima kept fighting.  Then Drona himself attacked! Their fight was fierce, like gods battling giants.  Drona rained down arrows, but Bhima was tough. He was like a strong bull, unfazed by the arrows!  Then, Bhima cleverly grabbed Dronaâ€™s chariot and threw it to the ground!  Drona quickly jumped into a new chariot and sped away.

Bhima smashed through the enemy army like a storm through a forest!  He crashed through the Bhoja and Kamvoja soldiers, and even the Mlecchas! He was unstoppable!  He finally found his brother Arjuna, who was battling bravely.  Bhima shouted with joy! His loud roar was heard by Arjuna and Krishna, his friend and helper. They roared back, their voices echoing across the battlefield.

Yudhishthira, the kind Pandava king, heard Bhima and Arjuna's roars.  He felt happy and relieved. He hoped Arjuna would win his battle and that maybe, just maybe, the war would finally end. He wondered if Duryodhana, the wicked king, would make peace after seeing all his warriors fall.  He wished for the fighting to stop.  But the battle raged on!
