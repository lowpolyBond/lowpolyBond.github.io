Once upon a time, a kind pigeon was caught in a net by a hunter.  Her husband heard her sad cooing from a nearby tree.  The poor pigeon in the net thought, "Even if I'm not very important, my husband is so kind to me.  A wife makes her husband happy, and that makes everyone happy.  A husband is like a god to his wife.  If a husband doesn't love his wife, she's as sad as a flower dying in a fire."

Then, the trapped pigeon said to her husband, "I have a plan to save you. That hunter is cold and hungry.  Let's be kind to him. It's very bad to let someone who asks for help go hungry, just as bad as hurting a cow or a holy man! You're a wise bird. Let's do what pigeons should doâ€”be kind and good. People who are kind get a wonderful reward later!  You have babies and a family.  Don't be sad for me. I'm just one bird.  You can find another wife!  Please, be kind to the hunter."

The sad pigeon looked at her husband from her cage and said all this, her heart full of love and worry.
