Once upon a time, King Yayati lived in a beautiful place in the sky, where the gods lived!  Everyone loved and respected him. He was a very good king.  He sometimes visited a special place called Brahman's region.  He lived a long, long time in the sky.

One day, King Yayati talked to Indra, the king of the gods. Indra asked, "What did you tell your son Puru when you gave him your kingdom?"

Yayati said, "I told Puru that the land between the Ganga and Yamuna rivers was his. That's the best part of the country!  His brothers would rule the other lands.  I also told him some important things:

People who aren't angry are better than angry people.  People who forgive are better than those who don't. People are better than animals, and smart people are better than people who aren't smart.  Never be mean if someone is mean to you.  If you get angry, it only hurts you!  Don't say mean things to hurt others. Don’t be sneaky or unfair when you win against your enemies.  Never say hurtful words.  Being mean is like hurting people with thorns.  Good luck runs away from mean people!

Always copy good people. Think about what good people would do, and do that.  Don't listen to mean people.  Always try to be like the wise people.  Mean words hurt more than you think! They’re like arrows that hurt your heart.  Wise people don't say mean things.

The best way to be good is to be kind, friendly, and generous. Always say nice things.  Be kind to people who deserve it.  Always give, and never ask for things!"
