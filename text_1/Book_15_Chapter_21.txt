Once upon a time, the king of Hastinapura went to live in the forest.  The Pandava brothers were very sad. Their mother had gone with him.  Everyone in the city was sad too.  They worried about the old king.  "How will he live in the forest?" they wondered. "How will the queen and Kunti live? They've always had a comfortable life!"

People talked about how hard it must be for the king, who couldn't see. They felt sorry for Kunti, who left her sons and her comfortable life to go with him. They also worried about Vidura, the king's wise advisor, who was always loyal.  Even the children in the city were asking questions.

The Pandavas were very, very sad. They missed their mother and father. They thought about their grandfather, the king, who had lost all his children.  They remembered the big battle and all the people they had lost. They missed Abhimanyu, a brave young warrior, and Karna, a powerful fighter.  They missed Draupadiâ€™s sons and many of their friends.  Draupadi and Subhadra had lost their children too, and were very sad.

The Pandavas were so unhappy they couldn't enjoy being kings.  They couldn't enjoy anything!  They were so sad that they almost couldn't keep living.  But then they saw Parikshit, their grandson,  and that gave them a little bit of hope. They stayed alive because of him.
