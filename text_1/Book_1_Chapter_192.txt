Once upon a time, there was a princess who was going to choose a husband.  Many kings wanted to marry her!  But she had a special test.

Brave Arjuna and his brother Bhima, disguised as Brahmins (holy men), arrived.  Lots of angry kings tried to stop them.  The kings shouted, "We'll fight!"

Arjun smiled.  "Step aside," he said. "I will handle these kings like a snake charmer handles snakes!"  Arjun and Bhima were strong and brave like elephants!  They fought the angry kings bravely.

King Karna, a very strong warrior, fought Arjuna.  They fought so fast, it was like a blur of arrows!  They shouted things like, "Look how strong I am!"  Karna was amazed by Arjuna's strength. He even asked, "Are you a god in disguise?"

Arjun said, "I'm just a Brahmin, but I'm a very good warrior!"  Karna stopped fighting because he thought Arjun was too powerful.

Bhima fought another strong king named Salya.  They wrestled and pushed each other, making loud crashing noises.  Bhima was so strong, he picked up Salya and threw him gently to the side!  Everyone was surprised!

The other kings were scared. They said, "These Brahmins are amazing!  Let's stop fighting.  They are too strong."  Krishna, a wise friend, said, "The princess has chosen well!"

The kings went home.  Everyone said, "The Brahmins won! The princess married a Brahmin!"  Arjun and Bhima, tired but happy, went to see their mother.

Their mother, Kunti, was worried.  She thought maybe bad things had happened to her sons.  She was so relieved to see them safe!  They came home looking like the sun coming out from behind the clouds.  They had won the princess's hand!
