Once upon a time, some princes accidentally blinded a group of children.  A wise woman explained, "Those children weren't angry.  A baby, a special baby from the Bhrigu family, is very angry! He's angry because the princes hurt his family a long, long time ago.  The baby was inside his mother's thigh for one hundred years! While he was there, he learned all the secrets of the world!  His anger blinded the princes. You must ask him to forgive you."

The princes begged the baby for forgiveness.  The baby, who was super powerful because he was born from his mother's thigh, forgave them. He was called Aurva, which means "thigh-born." The princes could see again!

But Aurva was still very angry. He wanted to destroy the whole world! He did very hard magic to become powerful, to punish the princes and everyone else.

His ancestors, the Bhrigu family, heard about this and rushed to stop him.  "Aurva," they said, "we know you're powerful now. But please stop!  We weren't killed because we were weak. We were tired of living so long! We wanted to die, so we tricked the princes into fighting with us. It was our plan to die.  We didn't want you to destroy the whole world for us!"

Aurva listened to his ancestors.  He calmed down.  He stopped his powerful magic. The world was saved!
