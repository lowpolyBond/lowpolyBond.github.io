Yudhishthira asked his grandfather Bhishma, "Grandfather, you told me about Nachiketa and the importance of giving cows. You also told me about King Nriga, who made a mistake and had to live as a lizard for a long time until Krishna helped him.  But I have a question.  What are these special places where people who give cows go after they die?"

Bhishma said, "That reminds me of a story.  It's about a conversation between a powerful god and someone who had done many good deeds."

Indra, the king of the gods, said, "Grandfather, I've heard that people who go to the cow-places are even more amazing than the gods in heaven! This makes me curious. What are these cow-places like? Tell me everything! What happens there? How do people get there? How long do they enjoy the rewards of giving cows?  What's the best thing that happens there? Can you give a few cows, or many? Does it matter how many? Can you get the same rewards even without actually giving a real cow? How can someone who gives a few cows be as good as someone who gives many?  And what's the best kind of gift you can give?"

Bhishma promised to tell Indra all about it.
