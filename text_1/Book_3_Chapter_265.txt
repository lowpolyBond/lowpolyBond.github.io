Once upon a time, a brave man named Kotikakhya told a story to some princes. He told them about a beautiful princess named Draupadi.  Draupadi was married to five amazing brothers, the Pandavas.

A mean king named Jayadratha heard about Draupadi. Kotikakhya described her beauty, and Jayadratha immediately wanted her for himself! He thought, "She's so beautiful, all other women look like monkeys!"

Jayadratha rushed to see Draupadi. He went to her secret hiding place with some guards. It was like a wolf going into a lion's cave!  He greeted Draupadi politely, asking if her husbands were well.

Draupadi was very kind. She said everyone was fine, and offered Jayadratha food and gifts. She even offered him lots of animals for a feast!  The Pandavas would hunt even more animals for him.

But Jayadratha was not nice. He said, "Forget those Pandavas! They are poor and weak.  A smart woman should be with a rich king like me! Come with me and be queen!"

Draupadi was angry. She frowned and told Jayadratha, "Don't you dare talk to me like that!  You should be ashamed!"  She didn't listen to him, because she loved her husbands very much. She knew they would return, and she waited patiently for them.  She used clever words to keep Jayadratha busy until her husbands returned.
