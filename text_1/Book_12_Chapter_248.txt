Once upon a time, a wise man named Vyasa told a wonderful story about how our minds work.  He said our minds think of lots of things.  Then, our understanding helps us figure out what those things are. Our hearts tell us if we like something or not. These three – our mind, our understanding, and our heart – help us decide what to do.

Vyasa said that things we see, hear, smell, taste, and touch are important. But our minds are even more important than those things!  Our understanding is more important than our mind, and something even more important than our understanding is our soul.  Our understanding is like our soul in everyday life.

Sometimes, our understanding thinks of new things. When that happens, it's like our mind.  Our understanding is amazing because it can do lots of things! When we hear, it's like our understanding is our ears. When we see, it's like our understanding is our eyes.  It changes depending on what we're doing!

Our understanding can feel happy or sad. Sometimes it feels neither happy nor sad.  But our understanding is even stronger than happiness and sadness. It's like a big ocean, always stronger than the rivers that flow into it.

When our understanding wants something, it becomes our mind.  All our senses – seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and touching – are part of our understanding. We need to control our senses so they don't take over.

Our minds, understanding, and souls have three parts: goodness, passion, and darkness. These parts are like spokes on a wheel, all connected.

To understand our souls, we need to use our senses like a bright lamp to shine away the darkness.  People who practice Yoga learn this easily, but people who avoid wanting too many things also learn this easily.

The world is all made up in our minds. Smart people don't get upset by things in the world. They don't get too happy or sad or jealous.  Our souls are hard to see. Even good people can't always see their souls.  But if we control our minds, we can see our souls, like seeing something in the dark when we turn on a light.

Just like a duck on water isn’t wet, a wise person can enjoy things without being hurt by them.  A wise person focuses on their soul, which is the most important thing.  They stay away from too much goodness, passion, or darkness.

Our souls are always aware of everything. They create everything. The soul sees everything but is not created by it.  The soul is always with our understanding, like a fish always lives in water. Or like a tiny insect inside a fig; they're different, but always together. This is the difference between our understanding and our soul – they're different but always together.
