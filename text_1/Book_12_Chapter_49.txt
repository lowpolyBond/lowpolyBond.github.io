Once upon a time, the Pandavas and their army, led by Krishna, rode in their magnificent chariots towards Kurukshetra.  It was a scary place!  The battlefield was a terrible sight, covered with bones, broken weapons, and the bodies of many, many soldiers.  It looked like a huge, messy graveyard.

Krishna, who was a great warrior, pointed to some lakes in the distance. "Yudhishthira," he said, "those are Rama's lakes.  Long ago, Rama, a powerful warrior, fought many battles here and defeated his enemies. He poured offerings of blood into these lakes to honor his ancestors."

Yudhishthira was puzzled. "Krishna," he asked, "you say Rama killed so many soldiers that almost no soldiers were left! But how did the army grow again?"

Krishna smiled.  "That's a long story," he said. "Let me tell you how the earth filled with Kshatriyas again, after Rama's great battles."

And Krishna told Yudhishthira the whole story, explaining how even after so many soldiers were killed, the Kshatriya army grew again over time.
