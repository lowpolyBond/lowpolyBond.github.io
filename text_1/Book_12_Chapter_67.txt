Once upon a time, a young prince named Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandpa, what's the most important thing for a kingdom to do?"

Bhishma smiled.  "The very first thing," he said, "is to choose a king!  A kingdom without a king is like a ship without a captain. It's messy and everyone fights!  Bad people steal and nobody is safe.  It's the worst thing that can happen."

Bhishma explained that choosing a king is like choosing a powerful god, Indra, to protect everyone.  People should respect their king, just like they respect the gods.  If a strong king from another kingdom comes to take over a messy, leaderless kingdom, the people should welcome him politely.  It's better to bend like a willow in the wind than to break like a stubborn oak.

Bhishma told a story:  "Long ago, people lived without a king.  They argued and fought. Strong people took things from weaker people.  Finally, they decided they needed a leader. They asked Manu, a very important person, to be their king."

But Manu was scared!  "Being king is very hard," he said. "People lie and cheat all the time!"

The people said, "Don't worry, Manu! We'll give you a share of our food, our treasures, and our prettiest daughters for marriage!  The bravest warriors will be your bodyguards! You’ll be like Kuvera, the rich god who protects all the magical creatures!"

Manu agreed. He became a strong and fair king. He punished bad people and helped good people. Everyone was happy and safe because they finally had a good leader.

Bhishma said to Yudhishthira, “So you see, a kingdom needs a king! Everyone should show respect to the king. The king should be kind and fair, always treat people nicely, and make sure everyone is safe and happy."  He should be strong but also kind.  Then everyone will have a good life!
