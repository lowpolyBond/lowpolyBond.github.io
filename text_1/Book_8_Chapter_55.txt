Once upon a time, during a great battle, Ashvatthama, Drona's son, was fighting! He was a super-skilled archer.  He shot so many golden arrows that the sky was filled with them! It looked like a beautiful golden rain.  It was so many arrows, you couldn't even see through them!

King Yudhishthira, with his friends Satyaki and his brave cousins (the sons of Draupadi), were trying to fight back. But it was hard! Ashvatthama's arrows were everywhere.  Even Satyaki and the others had trouble fighting.  They were amazed by how fast and strong Ashvatthama was. He was like a blazing sun!

The Pandavas fought bravely. Satyaki shot 70 arrows, then 7 more! Yudhishthira shot 73, and the other heroes shot many arrows too. But Ashvatthama was strong! He shot back, hitting everyone with lots of arrows. He even broke Srutakirti's bow!

Ashvatthama was so good that he broke Yudhishthira's bow too! But Yudhishthira got another bow and shot back!  Satyaki got angry and broke Ashvatthama's bow, but Ashvatthama was quick. He knocked Satyaki's driver off his chariot!

Ashvatthama kept shooting arrows.  It was like a big forest fire!  The Pandava army was getting scared.  Everyone thought the Pandavas were going to lose.

Yudhishthira, who was also a great archer, got mad. He shouted at Ashvatthama, "You're a warrior, not a priest!  A priest should be kind, not trying to kill me!"  But Ashvatthama didn't answer. He just kept shooting arrows.

Finally, Yudhishthira had to leave! Ashvatthama also moved on. Yudhishthira went to fight other soldiers,  leaving that part of the battle behind. The battle was still going on!
