Once upon a time, a king named Janamejaya wanted to kill all the snakes!  He was very angry.

Ruru, a young boy, wanted to know why. He asked a wise man.  The wise man said, "You should ask someone else, a really clever person."  Then, *poof*! The wise man disappeared!

Ruru looked everywhere for the wise man, but he couldn't find him.  He was so tired and confused! He went home, sad and puzzled.

He asked his dad, "Dad, why did the king want to kill all the snakes?"

His dad told him a wonderful story about a brave boy named Astika who saved the snakes!  It was a long and exciting story.

And that's how Ruru finally learned why the king was angry and how the snakes were saved.  The end!
