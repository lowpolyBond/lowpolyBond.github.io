Once upon a time, after a big war, the Pandava brothers won back their kingdom.  They were very kind.  They didn't want their uncle, King Dhritarashtra, to be sad.  Dhritarashtra had lost all his sons in the war.  His wife, Gandhari, was very upset too.

The Pandavas made Dhritarashtra the head of the kingdom, even though they were the real kings.  Vidura, Sanjaya, and Yuyutsu (Dhritarashtra's son from another wife) helped take care of the old king.  The Pandavas always asked Dhritarashtra for advice. For fifteen years, they listened to him carefully.

They visited him often and showed him great respect.  They bowed down to him and even smelled his head, a sign of great love.  Draupadi, Subhadra, and all the Pandava wives treated Dhritarashtra and Gandhari like their own parents.

Yudhishthira, the eldest Pandava brother, gave Dhritarashtra the best food, clothes, and beautiful things.  Kunti, Yudhishthira's mother, was very nice to Gandhari.  Kripa, a wise and strong warrior, also helped look after Dhritarashtra.  Vyasa, a very wise man, often visited Dhritarashtra and told him stories.

Vidura made sure everything ran smoothly in the kingdom.  He was very good at managing things and made sure everyone was happy, even with little money.  Dhritarashtra even freed prisoners and forgave those who had done wrong. Yudhishthira didn't stop him.

Yudhishthira gave Dhritarashtra many nice things for his pleasure trips.  Dhritarashtra had all the same servants he always had: cooks, wine makers and everyone else he enjoyed.  The Pandavas gave him delicious food and the finest wine.  Many other kings came to see and respect Dhritarashtra too.  Many ladies, including Kunti, Draupadi, and Ulupi, served Gandhari like they were her servants.

Yudhishthira always told his brothers to make sure Dhritarashtra was happy.  They all tried their best, except for Bhima.  Bhima still remembered the unfair things that had happened before the war, and he couldn't forget them.
