Once upon a time, a wise man named Narada told a story.  He said, "Listening to good stories makes you happy and calm. It helps you understand things better.  People who don't understand things often feel sad and scared. But smart people don't worry so much!"

Narada told some stories to help his friend feel better. He said, "Don't be sad about things that already happened.  If you keep thinking about the past, you'll never be happy.  Instead, try to see the bad parts of things you like. That way, you won't be upset when they go away."

Narada explained, "Everything changes.  We get things, and we lose things.  Rich people and poor people both feel this.  Don't be sad when you lose something. It's just part of life. People who are wise don't get too upset when bad things happen."

He said, "Things like being young, being pretty, having lots of money â€“ they don't last forever.  Don't be sad when they're gone. If something bad happens to lots of people, don't only be sad for yourself. Try to help fix it!"

Narada continued, "Life has more sad times than happy times.  Everyone likes nice things, but death is sad. The wisest people don't get too happy or too sad. They are peaceful.  When someone dies, wise people don't cry.  They know it's part of life."

He said, "Having money can be hard. Getting money is hard. Keeping money is hard. Don't be sad when you lose money.  Smart people are always happy with what they have. Everything ends eventually.  Everything that goes up, comes down. Everything that starts, ends."

Narada said, "Being happy with what you have is the best thing. Life goes by fast.  Nothing lasts forever.  Think about this and try to be good. Death comes like a tiger grabbing its prey.  It takes people who want too many things.  So, always try to be happy.  Don't let sadness take over!"

Narada finished his stories with this advice: "Control your wants and your desires. Use your mind to control your eyes, ears and other senses. Use wisdom to control your thoughts and words. Be kind to everyone. If you do this, you will be happy and wise."
