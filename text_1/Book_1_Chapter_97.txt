Once upon a time, there was a kind king named Pratipa. He prayed a lot by the river Ganga. One day, a beautiful woman appeared from the river! She was a magical fairy.  She sat on King Pratipa's lap and asked him to marry her.

King Pratipa was a good man. He said, "I only marry women of my own kind. I made a promise!"

The fairy said, "I'm not an ordinary woman! I'm beautiful and special. Please marry me!"

King Pratipa said, "I can't break my promise.  But you can marry my son!"

The fairy agreed.  She said, "I'll be a good wife to your son. I'll help him and give him happiness."  Then, poof! She disappeared.

King Pratipa and his wife really wanted a son.  They prayed for a long time, and finally, they had a baby boy! They named him Santanu.  He was a good boy.

When Santanu grew up, King Pratipa told him, "A beautiful fairy wanted to marry you a long time ago! If you see her, marry her. Don't worry about anything else."

King Pratipa went to live in the forest. King Santanu loved to hunt. One day, while hunting near the river Ganga, he saw a beautiful woman. She was even more beautiful than the fairy!

She was so beautiful that Santanu was speechless.  He asked her to marry him.  He didn't even ask who she was!  The beautiful woman agreed to marry him because she loved him too.  And that's how Santanu met his beautiful wife!
