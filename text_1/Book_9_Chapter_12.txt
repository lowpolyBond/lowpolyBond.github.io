Once upon a time, in a great battle, Bhima and Shalya fought!  Shalya's driver fell, so Shalya grabbed his heavy iron mace. He looked strong and scary, like a giant fire, or a powerful god!  Bhima, with his own big mace, charged towards him.

BOOM!  The battle horns blew! Everyone cheered, saying, "Wow!  Only a few warriors are as strong as Bhima! And only a few are as strong as Shalya!"

Bhima and Shalya swung their maces.  They spun around, leaping high in the air, their maces flashing like lightning. Shalya's mace was wrapped in gold, and Bhima's mace sparked when they hit!  It was like two giant elephants fighting, or two strong bulls butting heads!

They smashed their maces together again and again.  They were covered in blood, but they kept fighting!  Neither warrior moved, even when hit hard.  The noise was like thunder!

They stopped for a breath, then charged again, crashing their maces together with a huge BANG!  They were so strong that both of them fell down at the same time! Everyone gasped!

Kripa quickly rescued Shalya and took him away.  But Bhima jumped up, still fighting mad, and yelled, "Come on, fight again!"

Then, a huge fight broke out!  Many warriors from both sides fought hard, their weapons clashing.  Shalya's side fought bravely, but the Pandavas fought even harder!  Shalya's prince even killed one of the Pandavas' best warriors!

Shalya and Yudhishthira, the Pandava king, fought with arrows. They shot many arrows at each other, aiming for important spots.  Shalya even knocked down Yudhishthira's flag!  It fell down like a broken mountain!  But Yudhishthira, strong and brave, kept fighting.  He shot so many arrows that it looked like a big cloud of arrows!  Shalya was so strong but finally even he got hurt.   This was a very long and fierce battle!
