Once upon a time, King Saryati heard that Chyavana, a wise old man, had become young again!  He was so happy, he rushed with his army to Chyavana's home.  He saw Chyavana and his wife, Sukanya, looking like beautiful children from the heavens.  King Saryati was overjoyed; it was like winning the whole world!

Chyavana, who was very kind, welcomed the king and queen. They chatted happily for a long time. Then Chyavana said, "King, I'll perform a special ceremony for you. Please get everything ready."

King Saryati was thrilled! He built a beautiful place for the ceremony.  Chyavana became the priest.  During the ceremony, Chyavana wanted to offer a special drink called Soma juice to the Aswins, two magical twin doctors.

But Indra, the king of the gods, stopped him.  Indra said, "The Aswins are just doctors; they can't have the Soma juice!"

Chyavana disagreed. "The Aswins made me young again!" he said. "They deserve the Soma juice as much as you!"

Indra argued, but Chyavana went ahead and offered the Soma juice to the Aswins.  Indra got angry and threw a powerful thunderbolt! But Chyavana was so powerful, he stopped Indra's arm!  Then, Chyavana chanted powerful words and continued the ceremony.

Because Chyavana was so strong, a HUGE, scary monster named Mada appeared! Mada was so big, his mouth touched the ground and reached the sky! His teeth were like sharp towers, and his arms were like mountains!  He roared, and the whole world shook! He wanted to eat Indra!
