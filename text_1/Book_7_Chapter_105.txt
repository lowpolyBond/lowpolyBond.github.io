King Dhritarashtra asked, "Arjuna was close to winning, but what happened when the Panchala soldiers fought the Kauravas, Sanjaya?"

Sanjaya answered, "King, the battle between the Panchalas and the Kauravas was fierce!  Everyone wanted to win or lose depending on what happened to Drona.  The Panchalas roared and shot many arrows at Drona, wanting to defeat him. It was a huge battle, like the one between the gods and the demons long ago!  Many warriors fought bravely.  Vrihatkshatra, a strong warrior, attacked Drona. Kshemadhurti fought Vrihatkshatra. Then Dhrishtaketu fought Kshemadhurti.  It was one amazing fight after another!

King Yudhishthira fought Drona himself. Vikarna fought Nakula. Durmukha fought Sahadeva. Vyughradatta fought Satyaki.  The five sons of Draupadi fought Somadatta’s son.  Bhima fought Alamvusha, a powerful demon. This fight was like the great battle between Rama and Ravana!

Yudhishthira shot many arrows at Drona. Drona was angry and shot many arrows back at Yudhishthira, hitting his chest! Drona even broke Yudhishthira’s bow!  Everyone thought Yudhishthira was dead!

But Yudhishthira grabbed a new bow! He shot Drona’s arrows away. Then, he threw a powerful spear! It looked like a scary snake!  Drona used his own powerful weapon to stop the spear. Yudhishthira also used a powerful weapon! He hit Drona and broke his bow!  Drona threw a big club at Yudhishthira, but Yudhishthira threw one back! The clubs crashed, making sparks!

Then Drona got angry. He shot many arrows. He killed Yudhishthira’s horses! He broke his bow and flag. He even hurt Yudhishthira! Yudhishthira jumped off his broken chariot. He was without a chariot or weapons. Drona was going to attack, and everyone in the Pandava army cried out, fearing for the king.

But Yudhishthira got onto Sahadeva’s chariot and escaped, safely driven away by his fast horses."
