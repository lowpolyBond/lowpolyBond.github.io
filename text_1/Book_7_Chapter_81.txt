Arjuna, a brave Pandava warrior, really wanted a powerful weapon.  He went to see Lord Shiva, the great god.  Arjuna was excited! He saw offerings to Lord Krishna beside Lord Shiva.  He asked Lord Shiva for a special heavenly weapon.

Lord Shiva smiled.  "I know what you want," he said.  "Near here is a magical lake. My amazing bow and arrow are hidden there!"

Arjuna and Krishna went to the lake. It sparkled like the sun!  Inside, they saw scary snakes â€“ one with a thousand heads!  But Arjuna and Krishna were brave. They prayed to Lord Shiva.

The magic of their prayers changed the snakes! The snakes turned into the powerful bow and arrow!  Arjuna and Krishna were happy. They gave the bow and arrow to Lord Shiva.

Then, a strong man with blue skin and red hair appeared.  He showed Arjuna how to use the bow and arrow.  Arjuna watched carefully. The man shot the arrow into the lake, then threw the bow in too!

Lord Shiva was pleased with Arjuna. He gave Arjuna the awesome Pasupata weapon!  Arjuna was so happy! He and Krishna bowed to Lord Shiva and went back to their camp, feeling like they could win any battle! They were even happier than the gods Indra and Vishnu when *they* got help from Lord Shiva long ago.
