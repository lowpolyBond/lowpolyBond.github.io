Once upon a time, the Pandava brothers, led by Yudhishthira, lived in a big forest called Dwaita.  Many wise Brahmins (holy men) came to live there too.  The forest lake was always filled with the beautiful sounds of their prayers and chants.  It sounded so holy, like a magical place!

The sounds of the Brahmins' prayers mixed with the *twang* of the Pandavas' bows and arrows. It was a wonderful mix of peaceful prayers and brave warriors!

One evening, a wise Brahmin named Vaka spoke to Yudhishthira.  "King Yudhishthira," he said, "the Brahmins are performing important religious ceremonies. You protect them, and they bless you!"

Vaka explained that Brahmins and Kshatriyas (warriors like the Pandavas) were like a powerful team.  Just like the wind helps a fire burn brighter, Brahmins' wisdom and Kshatriyas' strength, when working together, could defeat any enemy.

Vaka told a story about King Vali. Vali was powerful because he always honored the Brahmins. He was happy and successful. But when he stopped respecting them, he lost everything.

Vaka said, "A king without Brahmins is like an elephant without a trainer â€“ weak and lost!  Brahmins have wisdom, and Kshatriyas have strength. Together, they are unstoppable!"

He advised Yudhishthira to always listen to and respect the Brahmins, for it brings great success and fame.

All the Brahmins in the forest were very happy to hear Vaka praise Yudhishthira.  They all bowed down to show their respect, just like they would bow to the great god Indra in the sky!  There were so many: Dwaipayana, Narada, Jamadagnya, and many, many more wise and holy Brahmins! They all loved and respected Yudhishthira.
