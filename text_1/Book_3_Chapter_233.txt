Krishna, the brave warrior, talked with the Pandava brothers and some wise men.  He said goodbye and climbed into his chariot. He called for his wife, Satyabhama.

Satyabhama hugged Draupadi, the Pandavas' wife.  "Don't worry, Draupadi!" she said. "Your husbands are like gods!  They will win back their kingdom. You'll see!  Those mean women who laughed at you will be very sorry."

Satyabhama told Draupadi that her sons were safe and strong.  They were learning to fight, just like their brave uncles.  They were happy and well cared for in Dwaravati with Subhadra, Krishna's sister, and everyone loved them very much.

Satyabhama smiled and then went to Krishna's chariot. She walked around Draupadi to show her respect.  Then, Krishna, smiling kindly, said goodbye to the Pandavas and Draupadi.  He drove away in his chariot, pulled by fast horses, back to his city.
