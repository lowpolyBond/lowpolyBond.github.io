Once upon a time, during a big battle in the Mahabharata, Bhima, a strong Pandava warrior, was in trouble! A scary giant named Alayudha was attacking him.

Krishna, a wise and powerful friend, saw this. He told Ghatotkacha, another powerful warrior who was fighting Karna, "Ghatotkacha, Bhima needs help!  Go fight Alayudha first. Then you can fight Karna."

Ghatotkacha was brave. He stopped fighting Karna and zoomed off to fight Alayudha.  A huge, scary battle happened between these two giant warriors!

Meanwhile, other Pandava warriors like Nakula, Sahadeva, and Yuyudhana helped by fighting Alayudha's army.  Arjun also fought bravely, defeating many enemy soldiers. Karna, on the other side, was busy fighting many Pandava soldiers.  Seeing his friends in danger, Bhima rushed to help!

During the fight, Alayudha hit Ghatotkacha hard on the head.  Ghatotkacha was stunned for a moment, but he quickly got back up and fought even harder! He smashed Alayudha's chariot to pieces with a powerful mace!

Alayudha used magic to create a scary storm, but Ghatotkacha used his own magic to defeat it.  Then they fought with all kinds of weapons – swords, spears, clubs, and even rocks!  Their battle was so fierce, it shook the trees and mountains!

Finally, Ghatotkacha was stronger. He grabbed Alayudha, lifted him high, and then… *chop!* He cut off Alayudha's head!

The Pandavas cheered! They beat drums and blew horns to celebrate their victory.  Ghatotkacha proudly showed Alayudha's head to Duryodhana, the enemy king.

Duryodhana was very sad.  Alayudha had promised to kill Bhima, and Duryodhana thought he'd win the war because of that. Now, seeing Alayudha dead, Duryodhana worried that Bhima would keep his promise to kill him and his brothers!  The night ended with a great victory for the Pandavas.
