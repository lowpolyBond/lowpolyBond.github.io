Once upon a time, in the land of Bharat, a wise king named Yudhishthira asked his grandfather, Bhishma, a very important question.  Yudhishthira wanted to know: "If holy men are fasting, and another holy man invites them to a special meal, should they eat or not?"

Bhishma explained, "Holy men who fast for reasons *not* mentioned in the holy books can eat if they want. But those who fast for reasons *in* the holy books must not eat that special meal, or they break their fast."

Yudhishthira then asked, "Grandfather, is fasting the same as being holy?"

Bhishma said, "Many people think so. But true holiness isn't just about fasting. It's about giving up things you want. The best way to be holy is to give things away to others."  He told Yudhishthira that a truly holy person should always try their best to be kind and helpful. They should share food with others, always speak the truth, and study the holy books.  They should sleep little, eat simple food, and be kind to everyone.

Yudhishthira asked how to be truly holy. Bhishma explained that it involved eating only at certain times, being faithful to their spouse, giving gifts, and avoiding meat from animals that weren't killed for sacrifice.

Next, Yudhishthira wanted to know about giving and receiving gifts.  Bhishma said it's important who is giving and who is receiving.  If a good person gives a gift, the receiver isn't in much trouble. But if a bad person gives a gift, the receiver could get into serious trouble!

Bhishma told a story to explain.  Seven very holy men, along with their maid Ganda and her husband Pasusakha, were very hungry because there was a terrible drought.  They found a dead prince and were about to eat him.

Then, a kind king named Saivya found them.  He offered them many gifts – mules, cows, bulls, and lots of food – but the holy men refused. They said that accepting gifts from a king could be harmful.  Their holiness came from their hard work, not from gifts.

They explained that wanting things never stops.  One wish leads to another, just like a river keeps flowing.  Giving up wanting things is very important for being truly holy.

The king, Saivya, was very angry. He used magic to create a scary monster, Yatudhani, to punish the holy men.  Yatudhani planned to kill them if she learned the meaning of their names.

The holy men were walking in the forest when they saw a strong, healthy man with a well-fed dog.  They realized that this man was much healthier and stronger because he didn’t let his desires control him. They could also tell that he was much happier.

The holy men came to a beautiful lake, guarded by the scary monster, Yatudhani.  Yatudhani said the holy men could pick lotus stalks if they told her their names, and explained the meaning of their names.  One by one, they tried to do this, but Yatudhani didn't understand.

Then, a strong holy man named Sunahsakha came along.  He didn't explain his name; he hit the monster with a stick, and she turned to dust. He revealed that he was a powerful god sent to protect them.  He had taken some lotus stalks so that he could test their holiness.  The holy men were very happy they had passed the test.

Bhishma finished his story. He said that by being good and not wanting too many things, the holy men went to heaven.  And that this is the best way to live a good life.
