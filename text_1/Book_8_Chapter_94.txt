Once upon a time, during a big battle in the Mahabharata, a king named Shalya watched Arjuna's son bravely fighting.  Shalya was very scared and sad. He told Duryodhana, the leader of the Kauravas:

"Look at this terrible battlefield!  It's full of dead soldiers, horses, and elephants.  The elephants are huge, like mountains, all hurt and bleeding.  Their swords and shields are scattered around. The horses are groaning and bleeding too.  Many soldiers have fallen off their horses and elephants. Some are dead, some are dying. The ground is covered with bodies and broken chariots. It looks awful, like a scary river in the underworld!"

Shalya described how the battlefield was a mess of broken weapons: golden spears, swords, and shields were everywhere.  There were also lots of beautiful things:  golden ornaments, jewels, and fine clothes.  All these things belonged to the soldiers who were now dead.

Shalya pleaded with Duryodhana, "Turn back! Go back to camp! The sun is setting. This is all your fault!"

Duryodhana was very sad. He cried, "Karna! Oh, Karna!"  He was heartbroken because his friend Karna had died.  All the Kaurava soldiers were very upset. They looked at the blood-soaked ground and felt terrible.  They retreated to camp.

Even though Karna was dead, he still looked very strong and shiny, like the sun.  Everyone, even the gods and holy people watching the battle, were amazed.  They left to go home.  The other soldiers watched in awe.  They were scared by Karna's body, even though he was dead, he looked so powerful.

Arjuna, who had killed Karna, and Krishna, his friend, were very happy.  They blew their horns to celebrate their victory. The sound was so loud, it echoed all around.  The sound scared the other soldiers, and they ran away.

Everyone praised Arjuna and Krishna for their bravery. The gods, the holy people, and even the spirits congratulated them.  Arjuna and Krishna were very happy with their friends. They looked like powerful gods themselves. The battle was over.
