Once upon a time, after a very sad thing happened, a wise man named Narada stopped talking.  King Yudhishthira was very, very sad. He cried a lot.  He looked so unhappy that his mother, Kunti, felt sad too.

Kunti said, "My dear Yudhishthira, don't be so sad! Listen to me.  Long ago, I tried to tell Karna that he was your brother!  The sun god, Surya, also tried.  We both told him many times, but he wouldn't believe us.  He was angry and wanted to fight you all. Because of this, I stopped trying."

Yudhishthira, still crying, said, "Because you kept it a secret, this terrible thing happened!"  He was so upset he said, "From now on, no woman will ever be able to keep a secret!"

Then, Yudhishthira thought about his sons, grandsons, family, and friends. He was so sad and worried, it felt like a smoky fire inside his heart.  He was very, very unhappy.
