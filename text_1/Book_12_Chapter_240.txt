Once upon a time, a wise old man named Vyasa told a story about how to become truly wise and peaceful.  He said there are two ways: knowing things with your mind (like learning from books), and joining your mind, body, and spirit together (like meditation).

To do this, you need to be calm and quiet.  You need to control your feelings, like anger, wanting things too much, being scared, and being sleepy.  Anger goes away if you're calm.  Wanting things goes away if you don't focus on getting them.  Sleepiness goes away if you think about good things.

You also need to control your body.  Use your eyes to stop your hands and feet from doing bad things.  Use your mind to stop your eyes and ears from seeing and hearing bad things.  Use your actions to stop your mind and mouth from saying bad things. Be careful and humble to avoid fear and pride.

Vyasa said that everything comes from Brahma, the creator.  Brahma is like the bright light of the sun.  Being good helps you shine brighter:  Be kind, tell the truth, be helpful, be clean, and control your feelings.  Be happy with what you have. Treat everyone the same.

To become truly wise, you need to focus your mind.  Imagine it's like a leaky bag of water – if one of your senses (seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching) isn't controlled, your wisdom leaks out!  So, you need to tame your senses, one by one, like a fisherman catching the biggest fish first. Then, you focus your mind on Brahma.  It's like seeing a bright fire, or a shining sun. You see your own spirit, and everything is connected to it.

This takes practice.  Find a quiet place, like a cave or a mountaintop, and meditate.  Do this every morning and evening.  Be calm, eat simply, and treat everyone the same, whether they are nice or mean to you.  Don't worry about getting things, or losing them. Be like the wind, always moving but calm.

If you do this for a long time, you'll understand everything.  You'll see that a clod of dirt, a rock, and a piece of gold are all the same. You’ll become one with Brahma!  Bhishma, another wise man, said that if you follow this, you'll become truly peaceful and wise, until the end of the world.
