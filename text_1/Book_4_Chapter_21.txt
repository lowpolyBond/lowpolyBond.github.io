Once upon a time, the Pandavas were hiding in the kingdom of Virata.  Draupadi, their beautiful wife, was working there as a servant.  A mean man named Kichaka, who was a powerful friend of King Virata, was very rude to Draupadi. He kept bothering her.

Bhima, the strongest Pandava, was very angry.  He wanted to smash Kichaka's head!  But Yudhishthira, the Pandava king, told him to be patient.  Bhima was sad. He missed his kingdom, and he wanted to fight the Kauravas, the bad guys who had taken everything from them. He felt terrible that he couldn't fight back yet.

Draupadi was also very sad. She was crying. She told Bhima how Kichaka had been mean to her. He'd even kicked her in front of everyone!  She told Bhima how ashamed and hurt she felt.  The king didn't do anything to stop Kichaka because he was so powerful.

Draupadi said she would rather die than let Kichaka hurt her again.  She explained that good wives, like Sukanya, Sita, and Lopamudra, had always stayed by their husbands even through hard times. She wanted to be just as brave. She asked Bhima to wait just a little longer.

Bhima loved and respected Draupadi.  He hugged her and told her everything would be alright. He was very angry at Kichaka. He promised to protect her, and get revenge. He licked his lips, thinking about how he'd defeat Kichaka and make him pay for what he had done.  He knew he had to be patient, but Kichaka would pay for his actions very soon.
