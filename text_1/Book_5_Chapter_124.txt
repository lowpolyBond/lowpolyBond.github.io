King Dhritarashtra was sad. He wanted peace, but his son, Duryodhana, wouldn't listen.  Dhritarashtra told the wise Narada, "I wish for peace, but I can't make Duryodhana listen!"

Then, he asked Lord Krishna for help.  "Krishna," he said, "you always give good advice.  Duryodhana ignores me, my wife Gandhari, and even our wise friend Vidura. Please, talk to him!"

Krishna went to Duryodhana.  He said kindly, "Duryodhana, you're a smart and strong Kuru prince.  Why do you act so badly?  Only bad people act like you. Good people do what's right."

Krishna explained that Duryodhana's actions were wrong and dangerous.  "Your anger will hurt you and everyone you love. It makes no sense to fight your cousins, the Pandavas. They are brave and wise."

Krishna said, "Making peace with the Pandavas will make your father, grandfather Bhishma, and many others happy. The whole kingdom will be better off!  You are kind and smart. Listen to your parents! Good sons always do what their fathers ask."

Krishna continued, "Ignoring good advice is like eating a poisonous fruit â€“ it hurts you in the end!  Choose wisdom, not anger.  Listen to your friends, not just people who want to fight.  You are surrounded by mighty warriors, but the Pandavas are even stronger.  Why fight a war you cannot win?"

Krishna warned Duryodhana, "If you fight the Pandavas, you will destroy your family, your kingdom, and yourself!  Make peace with them, share the kingdom, and live a happy life. The Pandavas will even make your father king!"

Krishna pleaded with Duryodhana to choose peace. He said that choosing friendship and wisdom would bring happiness for everyone.  He painted a picture of a peaceful kingdom, and a happy life for Duryodhana, his family, and the entire land.
