A kind snake king, Padmanabha, lived in a beautiful city.  His wife told him a wise man, Dharmaranya, was waiting to see him.  Padmanabha wondered why this man had come.  He went to meet Dharmaranya, who was sitting peacefully by the Gomati River.

Padmanabha greeted Dharmaranya kindly.  "Hello!  Why have you come to our city?  Please don't be angry."

Dharmaranya smiled. "My name is Dharmaranya. I wanted to meet you, Padmanabha. I've heard you're not always here, so I've been waiting patiently, like a bird waiting for rain. I'm praying and studying to help you."

Padmanabha was very impressed. "You are so good! You only want to help others.  I am Padmanabha! Tell me what you need."

Dharmaranya said, "I'm happy to meet you! I have a question for you. I want to learn how to reach the Supreme Soul, the highest part of ourselves. I'm not attached to the world, but I want to understand this."  He paused. "You are so wise and kind, like the moon.  May I ask my question first?"

Padmanabha nodded,  "Of course! Ask away, my wise friend."
