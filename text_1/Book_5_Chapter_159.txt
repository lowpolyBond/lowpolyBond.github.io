Once upon a time, a powerful warrior named Rukmi arrived at the Pandavas' camp.  Rukmi was the son of King Bhishmaka, a very important king from the south.  He was a super strong warrior who learned to fight from the amazing teacher Drona.  Rukmi even had a magical bow called Vijaya, almost as powerful as the bows of the gods!

Rukmi was very angry.  Krishna, the clever and strong warrior, had married Rukmi's sister, Rukmini, without his permission.  Rukmi had chased after Krishna with a huge army, wanting to fight him. But Krishna was too strong, and Rukmi lost the battle.  Feeling ashamed, he built a new city and didn't go home.

Now, Rukmi came to the Pandavas, hoping to help them fight in the big war against the Kauravas.  He boasted, "I'm the strongest warrior! I can defeat anyone!  I'll even kill Drona, Kripa, Bhishma, and Karna for you!"

Arjuna, the Pandava warrior known for his amazing archery skills, smiled.  "I'm not afraid," he said. "I've fought many great battles, and I have my own powerful bow, Gandiva. I don't need your help."  Arjuna reminded everyone of his past victories, showing that he was a very strong warrior who had faced powerful enemies before.

Rukmi, feeling rejected, left the Pandavas and went to join the Kauravas instead.  But they didn't want him either!  So, Rukmi and another warrior left the war altogether.  The Pandavas then held a big meeting to plan their strategy.
