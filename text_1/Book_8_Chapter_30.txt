Sanjaya said, "King Dhritarashtra, a huge battle began!  Karna led the Kaurava army.  It was a super-duper battle, like the gods fighting the demons!  Lots of elephants, soldiers, chariots, and horses clashed.  They fought with swords, spears, and axes.  It was a terrible mess!

The battlefield was covered with dead soldiers.  Thousands of elephants, horses, and people lay dead.  Blood flowed like a river.  It looked like the land of the dead!

Then, the Pandava army, with your sons at the front, attacked Satyaki.  It was another huge battle!  Karna, strong like a god, fought bravely.  He shot arrows like the sun's rays! Satyaki fought back with his own arrows.  Many soldiers died on both sides.

Arjuna and Krishna joined the fight.  Their chariot looked amazing, with white horses and flags waving. Arjuna rained arrows down like a storm.  He killed many soldiers, elephants, and horses.  Duryodhana tried to fight Arjuna, but Arjuna broke his bow and chariot.  Arjuna also destroyed the bows of many other Kaurava warriors, like Drona's son and Kripa.  Then Karna,  fighting for the Kauravas, shot many arrows at Arjuna and Krishna. He was very strong and didnâ€™t get tired.  But Satyaki fought back and hit Karna with many arrows.  Lots of Pandava warriors surrounded Karna.

Karna fought fiercely. He destroyed many soldiers and elephants.  Finally, Arjuna rained down so many arrows that the Kaurava army was defeated.

The sun set, and it got dark.  The Kauravas, scared of fighting at night, went home.  The Pandavas, happy with their victory, went to their camp, making lots of happy noise with their instruments.  Everyone praised Arjuna and Krishna.  That night, scary creatures like ghosts and wild animals came to the battlefield."
