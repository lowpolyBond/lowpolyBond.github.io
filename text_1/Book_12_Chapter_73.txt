Long ago, in the land of Bharat, a wise old man named Bhishma spoke to King Yudhishthira.  He said, "A good king needs a wise priest! This priest should know all about the scriptures and be a very good person.  When the king and priest are good friends and work together, everyone in the kingdom is happy.  They'll protect everyone, even the gods and their ancestors!"

Bhishma told a story to explain this.  Aila asked Kasyapa, a very wise man, "What happens when the king and priest aren't friends?"

Kasyapa answered, "Bad things!  If they fight, the kingdom falls apart.  Robbers come, crops fail, and no one learns good things anymore.  It's like a boat lost at sea! The king's power comes from the priest’s wisdom, and the priest depends on the king to keep him safe."

Kasyapa explained that it’s like a fire: one small problem can make everything burn.  Bad people cause trouble, and a scary god named Rudra comes and punishes everyone, good or bad.

Aila asked, "If bad things happen to everyone, why should we be good?"

Kasyapa said, "Good people should stay away from bad people.  Being around bad people is like putting wet wood next to dry wood; the fire will spread!"

Aila said, "The sun shines on everyone, the wind blows on everyone, the rain falls on everyone."

Kasyapa said, "That's true in this life, but not after we die!  Good people go to a wonderful place, filled with happiness and sweetness.  Bad people go to a scary, dark place filled with pain.  So it's very important for the king and priest to be friends!"

Kasyapa ended by saying, "The priest is very important.  He was created first!  Kings should always honor and respect their priests.  If they do, both will be successful and happy.  Both need each other."
