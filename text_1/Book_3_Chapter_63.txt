Damayanti woke up alone in the scary forest.  Nala, her husband, was gone!  She cried, "Nala! Where are you? I'm all alone and afraid!" She was very sad.  She missed him terribly.  She wondered how he would survive alone in the forest, hungry and thirsty.

She ran and searched, calling for him. She was so upset, she would run then fall to the ground, crying.  She was heartbroken. She wished whoever had made Nala disappear would suffer even more.

While searching, Damayanti cried out so loudly, a huge snake heard her! The snake caught her!  Even then, she only cried for Nala. "Nala," she sobbed, "what will you do without me?"

Just then, a hunter heard her cries. He rushed to help and killed the snake. He saved Damayanti.  He was very kind, giving her food and water.

He asked Damayanti who she was and what happened.  Damayanti told him everything.  The hunter was very handsome, and he looked at Damayanti's beautiful face and perfect body.  He wanted to be with her.

But Damayanti was still very upset. She only loved Nala. When the hunter tried to force her, she got very angry!  She yelled, "I only love Nala!  I curse you to die!"  And suddenly, the hunter fell dead!  Damayanti was alone again, but safe.
