The Great Battle: A Mahabharata Story for Kids

Sanjaya, the storyteller, told King Dhritarashtra what happened in the big battle.  The Pandavas and Kauravas were fighting, and it was very, very messy!

First, Karna, a great warrior on the Kaurava side, was killed by Arjuna.  The Kaurava army was scared.  Without Karna, they didn't know what to do. They were like lost ships at sea!  Arjuna, with his loud roars, made them even more afraid.  They were like scared deer running from a lion!

The Kaurava soldiers were hurt and confused.  They dropped their weapons and ran in all directions. Some even fought each other by mistake! Some ran on horses, some on chariots, and some on elephants, leaving the soldiers on foot behind.  It was a big jumble! They were like travelers lost in a scary forest.  Even some elephants were scared and ran away!

Duryodhana, the Kaurava king, saw his army running away. He told his driver, "I'll stop Arjuna! Drive fast!" Duryodhana wanted revenge for Karna.  He wanted to defeat Arjuna, Bhima, and everyone else.

Meanwhile, Bhima, another strong Pandava warrior, was very angry.  With his huge iron mace, he smashed 25,000 Kaurava soldiers!  They were like moths flying into a fire.  Arjuna and his brothers fought bravely too.

The Kaurava soldiers were losing badly.  Duryodhana gathered his remaining soldiers and told them, "Don't run!  Fighting bravely is the best way for warriors to die.  It brings happiness in the next life.  It is better to die fighting than to run away."

So, the Kauravas fought again, but this time even harder! It was a huge, fierce battle, like a fight between gods and giants!  Duryodhana fought bravely, but even he was surrounded.  The Pandavas were very angry and ready to fight hard until the end!
