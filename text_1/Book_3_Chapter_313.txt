The Pandava brothers – Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva – were hiding in the forest.  They had promised to stay hidden for thirteen years to escape their wicked cousins, the Kauravas. Twelve years had passed.

Yudhishthira, the oldest brother, was worried. He and his brothers went to some wise holy men living with them in the forest.  "We need to hide for one more year," he said, his voice shaking. "But if the Kauravas – especially Duryodhana and his friends – find us, they will hurt many people."

The holy men listened. One of them, Dhaumya, told a story.  "Even powerful gods have hidden to defeat their enemies!" he said. "Indra hid to fight his foes.  Vishnu hid many times, even as a dwarf!  Many great heroes have hidden to win."

Dhaumya's stories made Yudhishthira feel better.  Bhima, the strongest brother, said, "Brother, we will do whatever you say! We will defeat our enemies!"

The holy men blessed the Pandavas.  The Pandavas, along with their friend Krishna, started their last year of hiding.  They were ready to fight when the time came, but for now, they needed to be very, very clever.  They traveled a short distance and sat down to plan.
