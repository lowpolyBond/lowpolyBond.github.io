Long ago, a powerful god named Mahadeva spoke to Arjuna, a brave warrior.  Mahadeva said, "Arjuna, you were once a great yogi, a friend of Vishnu, a super-strong god!  You and Vishnu, together, hold up the whole world!  You once used a magical bow to fight bad guys. This bow, Gandiva, is yours again!" Mahadeva gave Arjuna back his bow and two magic quivers that would never run out of arrows.  He also made Arjuna healthy and strong.  Then Mahadeva said, "Arjuna, you're amazing! Ask me for anything you want!"

Arjuna asked for a super-powerful weapon called Brahmasira. It was so strong it could destroy the whole world! He needed it to win a big, scary battle against his enemies: Karna, Bhishma, Kripa, and Drona.  He wanted to defeat all the bad guys â€“ demons, evil spirits, and more!

Mahadeva said, "I won't give you Brahmasira, but I'll give you something even better: the Pasupata!  It's the most powerful weapon ever! It can kill anyone or anything. But be careful! Use it only when you really need to, because it's so strong it could destroy everything!"

Arjuna was very happy. He thanked Mahadeva and learned how to use the Pasupata. When he got the weapon, the whole world shook!  The ground trembled, the wind howled, and trumpets sounded. Even the gods and demons watched in awe!  Mahadeva also gave Arjuna back his magical bow, Gandiva.  Then Mahadeva and his wife went back to their home in the sky, leaving Arjuna ready for battle.
