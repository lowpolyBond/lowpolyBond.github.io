Once upon a time, a king named Yudhishthira asked a wise old man, Bhishma, "How can a king be happy and free from worries?"

Bhishma said, "I'll tell you a story.  Long ago, King Sagara asked a very wise person, Arishtanemi, the same question."

King Sagara said, "How can I be happy and avoid sadness?"

Arishtanemi answered, "True happiness is being free from worries. People who are attached to things like their children, animals, money, and food, don't understand this.  Worries come from wanting things and being attached to things."

Arishtanemi explained, "After you have children and they grow up and can take care of themselves, let go of your worries about them. If your wife gets old, it’s okay to let go of your worries about her too.  Enjoy life with your senses, but don't get too attached to anything. Be happy with what you have, and treat everyone fairly."

Arishtanemi continued, "Worries cause unhappiness. Even little creatures like ants and worms work hard for food, and they still die. People who aren’t attached to things are happier. Don’t worry about how your family will live without you.  Everyone has their own life journey, their own happiness and sadness. We all grow up, we all live and die on our own.  You can't control what happens to other people, even your family. What if you die before you can take care of them? Focus on what you can control – your own happiness."

Arishtanemi said, "True happiness comes from not wanting too much.  Don't let anger, greed, or bad choices control you.  Don't waste time on gambling or drinking. If you think about how hard it is to get food every day, you'll understand life better. Realize that having children is what keeps you tied to the cycle of life and death. Understand how life begins and ends, and accept that everything changes.  See a simple meal as the same as a big feast.  See a small house as the same as a palace.  See all clothes as equal, and be happy with what you have."

Arishtanemi said, "See that everyone gets sick, and everyone dies.  Understand that the world is made of simple things, not fancy ones.  Don't let happiness or sadness control you.  Don’t worry about winning or losing.  See your body as it really is—not perfect, and it will get old and weak.  Even gods and kings die.  It’s hard to get things in this world, it’s full of pain, and it's hard to take care of everyone you love.  If you understand all this, you will see that being free from worries is the best thing."

King Sagara listened carefully and learned to be happy and free from worries, and he ruled his kingdom well.
