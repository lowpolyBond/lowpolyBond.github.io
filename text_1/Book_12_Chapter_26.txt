Once upon a time, in the land of ancient India, King Yudhishthira talked to his brave cousin Arjuna. Arjuna thought that being rich was the most important thing. He believed only rich people could be happy and go to heaven.

Yudhishthira said, "Arjuna, that's not true!  Many wise people, called sages, go to heaven by studying holy books and being good. They live simple lives and do what's right.  These wise people are like shining stars! Even people who lived long ago, like the Ajas and the Prishnis, went to heaven by studying and being good."

Yudhishthira explained that there are two paths to heaven. One path is by studying holy books, doing good deeds, and being brave. The other path is by being peaceful and focusing on inner peace through yoga and meditation.  The second path, the peaceful one, is even better!

Yudhishthira said, "Being happy with what you have is the best thing.  It's better than being rich! When you aren't angry or too excited, and you're content, you are truly successful.  Think about it: a tortoise pulls its head and legs inside its shell when it's scared.  We should pull back our desires like that tortoise."

He continued, "When you aren't afraid of anything, and nothing scares you, and you don't want more than you need, you're close to being truly peaceful.  If you’re kind to everyone, in your thoughts, words, and actions, you’re even closer.  If you let go of pride and greed, you’ll find true happiness."

Then Yudhishthira said, "Some people want to be good, some want to be kind, and some want to be rich.  But even if you want to be rich to be good, it's better not to want wealth at all. Wealth can cause problems. We've seen it!  It's hard to give up wealth once you have it. Rich people don't always do good things."

He said, "Getting rich often means hurting others.  Even a little bit of wealth can make someone greedy and do bad things.  If you get rich, you'll be sad if you have to give some of it away, even to your own servants! And if you don't share it, people will talk badly about you.  But if you're not rich, no one will say bad things about you!"

Yudhishthira explained that God created wealth so people could use it for good things, not just for themselves.  It's meant to be shared.  If you give it to people who don't deserve it, or don't give it to those who do, you're making a mistake.  Being kind and sharing is difficult, but it’s worth it. Wealth is a test to see how good we really are.  If we use it wisely, it helps others.  If not, it can make us miserable.
