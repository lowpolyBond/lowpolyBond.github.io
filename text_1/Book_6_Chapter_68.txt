Once upon a time, a wise old man named Bhishma told King Dhritarashtra a very important story.  Bhishma said, "Many wise people and even gods have told stories about Krishna. They said he's like the creator of the world!  He's everything – the past, the present, and the future! He's like the strongest, wisest person ever."

Bhishma explained that Krishna is incredibly powerful.  He said Krishna is so strong that the sky is held up by his heads, and the Earth rests on his arms!  Even the whole world is inside him.

Bhishma told the king that many great saints and holy people worshiped Krishna. They knew he was amazing.

Then Bhishma finished by saying, "King, you should know that Krishna loves the Pandavas (the five brothers who are your nephews).  The Pandavas are unbeatable in battle because Krishna protects them.  Please make peace with them. If you don't, you will be in big trouble!"

After hearing this, the king’s son started to respect Krishna and the Pandavas a lot more.  Bhishma then reminded the king, "You've heard about the greatness of Krishna and how he protects the Pandavas, who can't be defeated. That's why you should make peace!"

The king was very impressed. He went to his tent and thought about what Bhishma had said. He respected Bhishma very much and then went to sleep.
