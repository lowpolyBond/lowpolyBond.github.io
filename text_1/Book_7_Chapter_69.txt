King Prithu was a very good king. He was Vena's son.  He was strong and brave, and won many battles. Everyone loved him! Because he was so wonderful, they called him "Prithu the Celebrated." He protected everyone, so he was a true warrior king.  His people were so happy, they called him "Raja," which means king.

Life was amazing during King Prithu's time! The land gave food without anyone needing to plant it. Cows gave milk just by being touched.  Lotuses were full of sweet honey. The grass was made of gold! People made clothes and beds from this amazing golden grass. All the fruits were sweet and yummy, like magic juice! No one ever went hungry. Everyone was healthy and happy, and their wishes came true. They lived wherever they wanted – in trees, caves, anywhere!  There were no cities or towns, just happy people.

When King Prithu went to the sea, the waves became hard ground! When he went through mountains, they made paths for him! His chariot never got stuck. One day, everyone – trees, mountains, gods, monsters, people, snakes, wise people, beautiful fairies, and ancestors – came to King Prithu. They said, "You’re our king, our protector, and our father! Give us what we want!"

King Prithu said, "Of course!" He had a special bow and arrows. He looked at the Earth and said, "Earth, give us your milk!" The Earth said, "You’re like a father to me."

So, everyone "milked" the Earth!  The trees milked it and got sweet juice.  The mountains milked it and got precious jewels.  The gods milked it and got strength. The monsters milked it and got wine. People milked it and got crops to grow. Snakes got poison. Wise people got wisdom, and so on! Everyone got exactly what they needed.  The things they used to milk the earth—the “calves” and “buckets”—are still around today!

King Prithu gave everyone wonderful gifts. He made lots of golden statues and gave them away.  He even gave away golden elephants! He made the whole Earth beautiful with jewels and gold, and gave it to the good people!

Even though King Prithu died, he was a very great king, and everyone remembered him. He was kind, brave, and made everyone happy.
