Once upon a time, there was a powerful king named Yayati. He was the son of Nahusha and the father of Puru.  Yayati had done some bad things, and he was falling from the beautiful heavens. He was sad because he had lost his goodness. He met a wise man named Ashtaka.

Yayati said, "I'm older than you, so you should bow to me first."  Ashtaka replied, "Being older isn't everything.  Being wise and good is more important."

Yayati agreed that being good was important. He said, "Being proud can lead to trouble. Good people always try to be better. I used to be very good, but I lost that.  Even the richest and smartest people must be humble to be happy.  Everything depends on destiny, what's meant to be.  We shouldn't be too happy when things go well or too sad when things go wrong.  It's all part of life. I know I'll be wherever destiny takes me. Even tiny insects and plants all go back to the great spirit in the end. Happiness and sadness don't last forever, so why worry?"

Ashtaka asked Yayati to tell him about the wonderful places he’d visited in heaven.  Yayati said, "I ruled the whole world!  Then, because I was good, I went to many beautiful places in heaven. I spent a thousand years in one place, then went to even more amazing places! I lived in Indra’s palace, a beautiful place with a thousand gates!  I even lived in the home of Vishnu, the god of gods! I lived happily for a million years, playing with beautiful creatures in magical gardens. But then… I heard a scary voice three times shouting, 'Ruined! Ruined! Ruined!' My goodness was gone! The angels cried, 'Yayati is falling!' They showed me your place.  I smell the yummy food being cooked, and I’m glad to be here with you."
