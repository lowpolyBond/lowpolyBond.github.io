Shalya, Karna's chariot fighter, boasted, "I could beat all their army!  I don't need a thousand Karnas!"

But Karna was angry. He told Shalya a story:  "I heard this from wise priests at King Dhritarashtra's palace.  They told tales of faraway places and kings. One old priest said bad things about the Vahikas and Madrakas people. He said they were bad people who lived far away, near no holy rivers or places.  Their homes were messy, and they always drank too much."

Karna continued, "The priest said the Vahikas drank a lot and ate unusual foods like beef and fried barley. Their women danced and sang silly songs in the streets, without any nice clothes or jewelry. They didn't follow any good rules. They behaved badly, even on special days! The priest said he had to go there once, and he hated it. He really didn't like the Vahikas.  He said a Vahika man even missed his girlfriend terribly while he was far away, and that shows how bad they were."

Karna went on, "The priest told another story about a woman who sang songs about eating lots of meat and drinking. She said people who donâ€™t eat sheep were silly.  Another priest said another group, the Arattas, were even worse. They lived near five rivers, far away from sacred mountains. They didn't follow rules and didn't offer gifts to the gods. They ate from dirty plates and drank milk from any animal!  They were not good people at all.  The priest said the Vahikas and the Arattas were very bad and that nobody should ever visit them. He said you, Shalya, are just like one-sixth of them! So you are not that good either!"
