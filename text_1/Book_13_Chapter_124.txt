King Yudhishthira asked a wise man, Bhishma, "What's better: making peace with someone or giving them gifts?"

Bhishma said, "Some people like peace, others like gifts.  It depends on the person."  Then he told a story:

"Once, a clever priest got caught by a scary ogre in the forest! The ogre wanted to eat him. But the priest wasn't scared. He decided to talk to the ogre."

The ogre said, "You can go, but tell me why I'm so skinny and pale!"

The priest thought for a moment and said, "Ogre, you're rich, but you live far from your friends and family. That makes you sad.  Your friends aren't very nice to you, even though you're kind. That makes you sad.  You're wise, but other people who aren't as smart get more respect. That makes you sad."

The priest went on and on, giving lots of reasons why the ogre might be sad. He talked about the ogre's:

* Lonely life
* Unkind friends
* Lack of respect
* Bad choices
* Unsupportive family
* Jealous neighbors
* Unfair friends
* Unfulfilled dreams
* Difficult choices
* Unrecognized achievements
* Unjust treatment
* Worry for others


The priest listed many reasons,  all showing he understood the ogre's feelings.  He understood the ogreâ€™s problems.

The ogre listened.  He was surprised someone cared.  He felt understood.

The ogre was so happy to have someone understand him, that he became friends with the priest and let him go! He even gave the priest lots of gifts!  So, sometimes kind words are more powerful than gifts!
