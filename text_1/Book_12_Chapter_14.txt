Once upon a time, after a big battle, King Yudhishthira was very quiet.  He didn't say a word. His brothers were sad too.  

Then, Draupadi, Yudhishthira's beautiful wife, spoke up.  She said, "My dear husband, your brothers are heartbroken! They fought bravely, but now they feel lost.  You promised them a happy life after the war, a life without hardship. Why are you so sad now? You said you'd conquer the land and make everyone happy, so why are you letting everyone down?"

Draupadi explained, "A king's job is to protect his people, not just to study holy books or give away everything.  A king needs to be strong and brave. You've won many battles, defeated powerful enemies, and ruled huge kingdoms! You are a great king! You've shown that you're stronger than anyone. So, why are you acting sad?"

She continued, "Your brothers are strong warriors! They deserve to be happy, and they deserve to be treated like the heroes they are.  I married all five of you, and I am happy with all of you. It’s important for you to be brave, strong, and happy."

Draupadi reminded Yudhishthira of his great victories. She said, "You've won so much! Don’t let sadness steal your joy. Be a great king, protect your people, and share your happiness with your brothers!"

Yudhishthira listened to his wise wife.  He realized he was being foolish. He cheered up, promised to be a good king, and made his brothers happy.  They all lived happily ever after, ruling their kingdom wisely and bravely.
