Rama's mother, Queen Kaushalya, was very sad.  Rama had to go live in the forest for fourteen years.  "My dear Rama," she cried, "you've never been hungry or cold! How will you live on fruits and roots?  I'll miss you terribly!"  She worried about Rama and felt very scared.  She felt like her heart was breaking.

Rama loved his mother very much.  He said, "Mother, I must obey my father, even though it's hard.  It's very important to always be good and kind.  You must stay with my father; he needs you.  I'll come back after fourteen years."

Queen Kaushalya was still very upset. "But my dear son," she sobbed, "I want to come with you!"

Rama explained, "Mother, you must take care of my father.  That is what good wives do. My brother Bharata will also take care of you. Please don't worry. I promise to return."

Queen Kaushalya knew she had to be strong for her husband and Rama. Even though her heart ached, she hugged Rama and wished him well. She knew she had to obey the rules of being a good wife and mother. She said, "My brave son, go and be safe. I will wait for your return."  She gave him a big hug, and Rama went to the forest, knowing his mother loved him and would wait.
