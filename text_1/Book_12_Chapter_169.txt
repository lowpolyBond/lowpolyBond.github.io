Once upon a time, a wise Brahmin named Gautama left his home. He was going towards the sea.  On his way, he joined a group of traders.  Suddenly, a very angry elephant attacked!  Many traders were hurt. Gautama ran away to save his life. He got lost in a big forest.

He wandered and wandered until he found a beautiful forest. It was like a magical place!  It had lots of mango trees with flowers and fruits all year round.  Pretty birds sang sweet songs.  Even special birds with human faces sang!  The forest smelled wonderful.

Gautama found a perfect spot under a huge banyan tree.  The ground was soft and wet, smelling like sweet sandalwood. It was so beautiful, it looked like a magical place from heaven!  Gautama was so happy, he fell asleep.

As the sun went down, a special bird arrived. His name was Rajadharman.  He was a very wise and famous crane, a friend of the gods! He was beautiful and shiny, like a jewel.  Gautama saw the bird and wanted to catch it because he was very hungry and thirsty.

But Rajadharman spoke!  "Welcome, Brahmin," he said. "You are my guest tonight.  Rest here. Tomorrow, you can go wherever you wish."
