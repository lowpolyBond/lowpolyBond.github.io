Once upon a time, a wise queen named Vidula had a son.  He lost a big battle and felt very sad. He just lay down, feeling hopeless.

Vidula, who was very brave and smart, was angry.  She said, "You're not my son!  A real man doesn't give up! You're weak and cowardly!"

She told him a story about a little stream. It only holds a little water. A mouse only holds a few seeds in its paws.  A coward is happy with tiny things.  "It's better to die fighting bravely," she said, "than to die a sad, weak life!"

Vidula told her son, "Be like a hawk!  Soar high!  Don't be a scared mouse!  Fight back! Show everyone how strong you are! Don’t hide. Be known for your brave deeds."

She continued, "A real man doesn’t give up easily. He tries his best, even if he doesn't win.  He doesn’t live a life of begging. He helps others, and they help him. He protects his family and his friends."

Vidula said, "Look at strong horses pulling heavy things. Be like that strong horse! Use all your strength! Don’t let your family down. Become a great warrior, and your name will be remembered forever. People will respect you.”

Her son finally understood. He said, "Mother, I don't want to disappoint you. I will fight again!"  Vidula was happy. She told him, "Let your friends depend on you, just like birds depend on a tree full of fruit.  Live a brave life, and you will be remembered as a hero.”  And so, her son became a brave warrior.
