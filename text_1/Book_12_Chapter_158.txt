King Yudhishthira asked his wise uncle Bhishma, "Uncle, where does badness come from?"

Bhishma said, "King, it all starts with wanting too much.  Wanting things you don't need is like a fire that burns up goodness.  This wanting is the root of all bad things.  It makes people angry, greedy, and mean."

He explained that wanting too much makes people:

* Angry
* Greedy
* Dishonest
* Arrogant
* Cruel
* Mean
* Steal things
* Hurt others
* Lie
* Cheat
* Be unhappy

"This wanting never goes away," Bhishma said. "It's like an ocean, always wanting to be filled, even if you pour in a million rivers.  Even the wisest people struggle with it."

Bhishma then talked about good people. These people are happy because they don't want too much. They:

* Aren’t afraid of death
* Don’t eat meat just for pleasure
* Are kind to everyone
* Are honest
* Help others
* Are brave
* Always do what is right

Bhishma said good people are peaceful, kind, and brave. They don’t brag or pretend to be good. They are always truthful. They don't worry about winning or losing. They treat everyone the same.

"Always be around good people, King," Bhishma advised. "Learn from them. Only with God's help can we use our words to do good."
