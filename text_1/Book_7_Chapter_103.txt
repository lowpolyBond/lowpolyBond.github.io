The Kuru army saw Arjuna and Krishna, and they wanted to fight!  They zoomed toward them in their shiny chariots, like bright stars in the sky.  The chariots rattled and roared, pulled by strong horses.  Eight brave warriors – Bhurisravas, Sala, Karna, Vrishasena, Jayadratha, Kripa, the King of Madras, and Aswatthaman –  led the charge.

They rained arrows down on Arjuna and Krishna.  Arjuna and Krishna blew their powerful horns,  Devadatta and Panchajanya.  The sounds were HUGE!  They shook the whole battlefield!  The other warriors blew their horns too, trying to be as loud.  The ground trembled, like thunder!

Then the battle began! Aswatthaman shot many arrows at Krishna and Arjuna. Arjuna fought back bravely. He shot arrows at Aswatthaman, Karna, Vrishasena, and Salya.  Salya got a new bow and shot back!  Bhurisravas, Karna, Vrishasena, Jayadratha, Kripa, and the King of Madras all shot arrows at Arjuna, too.  Arjuna was strong and clever. He fought them all, shooting hundreds of arrows!  He shot down their bows and even hit Bhurisravas’s whip!

The battle was fierce and noisy, with lots of arrows flying everywhere!  Arjuna and his friends fought hard to protect themselves. It was a very big and exciting battle!
