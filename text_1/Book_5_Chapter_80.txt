Nakula said, "Yudhishthira, our wise and kind king, has spoken. Arjuna has spoken too.  You, Krishna, know what I think.  You've said it yourself:  First, see what the enemy wants. Then, do what's right.

Things change.  What's good one day might be bad the next!  When we lived in the forest, we wanted different things.  We were hiding.  Now, we're back!  And we're not hiding anymore.

We didn't want the kingdom as much before. Now, we do.  Because we're back, you, Krishna, have helped us gather a huge army. It's so big and strong!  It makes anyone scared!

So, go talk to the Kauravas.  First, be nice. Then, be firm.  Make Suyodhana scared.  Who would fight against us?  Yudhishthira is brave. Bhima is strong. Arjuna is unbeatable!  Sahadeva and I are strong too!  And there's you, Krishna, and Satyaki, and all our friends and allies!  Everyone is scared of us.

You, Krishna, will easily get what Yudhishthira wants. Vidura, Bhishma, Drona, and Vahlika are wise. They'll listen to you. They'll tell Dhritarashtra and Suyodhana to listen too.  With you talking and Vidura listening, everything will be alright!"
