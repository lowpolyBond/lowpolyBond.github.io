Once upon a time, a wise man named Vibhandaka lived in the forest with his son, Rishyasringa.  Vibhandaka warned Rishyasringa about beautiful, but mean, demons.  These demons looked friendly, but they tricked people.  They tried to stop people from being good and praying.  Vibhandaka told Rishyasringa to stay away from them.

One day, some of these demons, disguised as pretty ladies, tricked Rishyasringa. They took him away on a boat.  They brought him to a king who really wanted Rishyasringa's help to make it rain.

Vibhandaka searched for his son for three days but couldn't find him.  He was very angry!  He thought the king had taken his son. He decided to go to the king's city to punish him!

On his way, he found lots of cows and fields.  Cowherds told him, "These belong to your son! He's married and very happy here!"

Vibhandaka was surprised.  He found Rishyasringa married to a lovely princess named Santa. They had a wonderful home with lots of cattle. Vibhandaka wasn't angry anymore. He was very happy to see his son happy.

He told Rishyasringa, "When you have a baby, come back to live with me in the forest."  Rishyasringa promised.  Santa loved Rishyasringa very much, and she always took good care of him.  They lived happily ever after in their special forest home.
