One morning, Rama woke up.  He woke his brother Lakshmana. "Lakshmana," he said, "listen to all the beautiful birds singing! It's time for us to travel. Let's go!"

Lakshmana woke up and they all went to the Yamuna River. They washed and prayed. Then they walked through a forest with pretty red flowers.  They were going to Cittrakuta mountain, just like the wise man told them.

Rama pointed to the pretty flowers and trees. "Sita," he said to his wife, "look how beautiful everything is!  The trees are full of blossoms.  And look, Lakshmana, there's a huge honeycomb!  Let's find a nice place to live on Cittrakuta."

They walked and walked until they reached Cittrakuta.  It was a wonderful place with lots of birds, tasty fruits, and clear pools of water. "This is perfect, Lakshmana!" Rama said. "It's a peaceful place, far away from everyone. We can live here."

They found a wise man named Valmiki.  They greeted him politely, and he welcomed them warmly. Rama told Valmiki why they had to leave their home.

"Lakshmana," Rama said, "let's build a hut!"  Lakshmana quickly gathered wood and built a cozy little hut.

"Now," said Rama, "let's make a special offering to the gods. Lakshmana, please hunt a deer."

Lakshmana found a black deer and cooked it. Then Rama prayed to the gods and made an offering. He cleaned the hut and made it ready.  He prayed to keep them safe.

Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana moved into their new hut. It was a happy home, surrounded by trees, flowers, and the sounds of the forest. They lived happily on Cittrakuta mountain, near the Malati river, and forgot all about their troubles.
