King Dhritarashtra was sad.  "Sanjaya," he said, "this terrible battle is all my fault.  What should I do now?"

Sanjaya, his advisor, answered, "King, Karna and Bhima are fighting fiercely! They're shooting so many arrows, it's like a huge raincloud bursting!  Karna's arrows are hitting Bhima, and Bhima's arrows are hitting Karna!  The battlefield is a mess!  Thousands of soldiers are falling.  It's like a huge storm has broken all the trees."

"Elephants and horses are dead," Sanjaya continued. "Soldiers are running away, scared.  They shout, 'The gods must be angry!  These arrows are too powerful!'  They're hiding to watch Karna and Bhima fight.  The ground is covered with blood â€“ a river of blood from all the dead soldiers and animals."

Sanjaya described the battlefield: "It's covered with broken weapons, gold jewelry from the dead, and the bodies of elephants, horses, and soldiers.  It looks amazing, but terribly sad. Even the gods and magical beings are amazed by how powerful Karna and Bhima are."

"Karna and Bhima are like two angry elephants smashing through a forest," Sanjaya explained. "They're destroying everything in their path.  Your army is scattered, King.  The battle is terrible."
