Arjuna saw Bhishma fighting bravely.  He told Sikhandin, "Go fight Bhishma! Don't be scared. I'll help!"  Sikhandin, Dhrishtadyumna, Abhimanyu, and many other Pandava warriors rushed towards Bhishma.

On the other side, the Kaurava warriors fought back! Chitrasena fought Chekitana. Kritavarman fought Dhrishtadyumna.  Somadatta’s son fought Bhima. Vikarna fought Nakula. Kripa fought Sahadeva. Durmukha fought Ghatotkacha (the Rakshasa). Duryodhana fought Satyaki. Sudakshina fought Abhimanyu. Aswatthaman fought Virata and Drupada.  And Drona fought Yudhishthira.  Dussasana fought Arjuna.  Many other warriors fought too!

Dhrishtadyumna shouted, "Arjuna is fighting Bhishma! Attack him! Don’t be afraid! Even the gods can't beat Arjuna!"  The Pandava warriors, feeling brave, attacked Bhishma’s side.

Dussasana, wanting to protect Bhishma, fought Arjuna. They were both amazing warriors, strong and handsome.  They fought like lightning! Dussasana hit Arjuna with some arrows, and Arjuna hit Dussasana with many more!  They kept fighting, hitting each other with lots of arrows.

Arjuna was hit, but he didn't give up.  He shot more arrows and broke Dussasana’s bow and chariot!  Dussasana was hurt, but he quickly went to help Bhishma.  Bhishma was like a safe place for him.  Dussasana kept fighting, but Arjuna was very strong.

Even though he was hit many times, Arjuna kept on fighting bravely, just like a hero!
