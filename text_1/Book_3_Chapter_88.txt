A wise man named Dhaumya told Yudhishthira a story about amazing places in the south.  He talked about the Godavari River, a beautiful river with lots of trees and holy people living nearby.  There were other rivers too, the Venna and Bhimarathi, filled with birds and deer.  These rivers could wash away bad feelings!

Dhaumya also told Yudhishthira about the Payoshni River.  This river was special because a great king named Nriga used to live there.  Even the water from the Payoshni could wash away sins!  There was a statue of a powerful god near the river, and people said seeing it would send you to heaven! Dhaumya said the Payoshni was even better than the Ganges River!

He went on to tell about the Mathara forest, with lots of yummy fruits and a special place for ceremonies.  He mentioned other holy places with lots of trees and places where holy people lived. He also spoke of a lake called Gokarna, very special and hard to reach unless you're a good person.  Nearby lived a holy man named Agastya.  He also talked about a mountain full of beautiful jewels!

Then Dhaumya talked about a place called Surashtra.  Here, he said, were places near the ocean where the gods themselves had been! There was a mountain called Ujjayanta, where people could become very important in heaven if they were good.  And finally, Dhaumya told about Dwaravati, the home of Krishna!  Krishna was very powerful and good, and people believed he was a god!  He was always kind and true, the best of the best!
