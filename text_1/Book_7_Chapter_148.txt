Once upon a time, in the great war, Arjuna, the brave warrior, defeated the king of the Sindhus.  Krishna, Arjuna's friend and advisor, went to Yudhishthira, the Pandava king, with happy news.

Krishna said, "Great King, good luck is with you! Your enemy is dead! Your brother Arjuna kept his promise!"

Yudhishthira was so happy, he jumped down from his chariot! Tears of joy filled his eyes. He hugged both Krishna and Arjuna.

"My brave warriors!" Yudhishthira cried. "I'm so happy to see you both safe! That bad king is gone! You brought me such joy! Our enemies are very sad. Krishna, you are amazing!  You help anyone achieve anything.  With your help, we will win, just like Indra, the king of the gods, won against the demons long ago. With you on our side, we cannot lose! It's because of you that Indra rules the heavens.  Because of your help, he became immortal!"

Yudhishthira went on and on, praising Krishna. He said Krishna created the whole world from darkness and water. He is the greatest God, the protector of everyone. He is always there to help those who believe in him.  "I put my faith in you," Yudhishthira said, "and I will be safe and successful."

Krishna and Arjuna smiled.  Arjuna said, "King, even though the Kauravas have a big army, they are losing. Your anger has destroyed them!  Bhishma, their great leader, is already defeated. They cannot win against you. Anyone who makes you angry loses everything - their kingdom, their family, even their life."

Then, Bhima and Satyaki, two other great warriors who were hurt in battle, came to greet Yudhishthira.  Yudhishthira hugged them too.  He was so happy to see them alive after a terrible battle where many brave warriors fought and died.  He said, "I'm so happy to see you both alive!  You defeated so many kings, even Drona and Karna! Youâ€™re my heroes!"

Everyone was overjoyed. The Pandava army cheered. They were ready to fight again, knowing Krishna and Arjuna were with them. They were ready to win the war!
