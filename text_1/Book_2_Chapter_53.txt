Rama and Lakshmana were now in the forest.  It was their first night away from home. Rama, who usually slept on a soft bed, lay on the hard ground.  He told Lakshmana, "Let's only have one of us sleep at a time. We must protect Sita."

Rama was worried about his father, the King.  He knew his stepmother, Kaikeyi, wanted the kingdom for her son, Bharata.  Rama feared Kaikeyi would hurt the king.  "She got what she wanted," Rama said sadly. "But now, she might even hurt the king!"

Rama worried about his mother and Kaikeyi hurting his other mother too.  He said, "Lakshmana, you should go back home to protect them.  I will stay here with Sita."

Rama was very sad. He missed his family. He felt it was unfair that he had to leave. He felt very badly that he caused his mother so much pain. He said he would never take the kingdom by force, even though he was strong enough to win. He cried all night.

When Rama stopped crying, Lakshmana said, "Rama, don't be sad! We need to be strong for Sita.  We can't live without you."  Lakshmana didn't even want to go back home.

Rama smiled a little. He knew he had to be brave. He sat next to Sita.  He and Lakshmana lived in the forest, strong and brave like lions on a mountain. They started their life in exile.
