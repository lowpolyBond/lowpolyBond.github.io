Bhima, the strongest Pandava brother, went to pick beautiful, magical flowers.  Suddenly, the wind howled!  The sky turned dark and stormy.  The ground shook!  Animals cried out. It looked like a big battle was coming!

Yudhishthira, the Pandavas' wise leader, worried. "What's happening?" he asked. He couldn't find Bhima.  He asked his wife, Draupadi, and the twins, Nakula and Sahadeva, where he was.

Draupadi said, "Bhima went to find more of those special flowers for me. He's very strong and fast."

Yudhishthira said, "Let's go find him!"  The Rakshasas, strong magical beings who were their friends, helped carry the tired Brahmins (wise men) and Draupadi.  They followed Bhima.

They found Bhima at a beautiful lake, surrounded by amazing flowers!  But...he'd also fought some Yakshas (magical beings who guarded the lake).  Heâ€™d defeated them! They were all hurt!

Yudhishthira hugged Bhima. "Bhima, what did you do? Don't fight like that again!" he said.  Bhima promised he'd be careful.

Then, some giants guarding the garden came. But when they saw Yudhishthira, the wise Brahmins, and the Rakshasas, they bowed down.  Everyone was happy.  They rested by the lake, waiting for Arjuna, another Pandava brother, to join them.
