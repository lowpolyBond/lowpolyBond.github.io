Once upon a time, after a great battle, Krishna, a powerful and kind king, woke up early.  He thought quietly about good things. Then, lots of people started singing beautiful songs and playing music.  Drums boomed, flutes whistled, and conch shells blew!  Krishna's palace filled with joyful sounds.

At King Yudhishthira's palace, happy songs were also sung.  Krishna cleaned himself, said some special prayers, and gave away lots of cows to wise people. He looked at himself in a mirror and then sent his friend Satyaki to Yudhishthira.

Satyaki told Yudhishthira, "Krishna is ready to visit Bhishma, the old warrior, and he's waiting for you!"

Yudhishthira said, "Let's go see Bhishma.  We don't need soldiers today.  Bhishma is very important, and we want to be respectful."

Yudhishthira, his brothers Bhima and Arjuna, and the twins, all got into their chariots.  Krishna and Satyaki were already in Krishna's chariot, pulled by fast horses.

The chariots zoomed along, making a rumbling sound like thunderclouds.  They reached Bhishma, who was lying on a bed of arrows, surrounded by wise men.

Everyone got out of their chariots and bowed to the wise men.  Yudhishthira, feeling a little scared, walked towards Bhishma, who looked like the sun fallen from the sky.
