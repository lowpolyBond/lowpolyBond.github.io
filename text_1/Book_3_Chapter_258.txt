Once upon a time, in a place called Kurukshetra, lived a very good man named Mudgala. He was honest, kind, and always tried to control his feelings.  He and his family lived a simple life. For two weeks, they would eat just enough to survive, like little birds.  For the other two weeks, they had a bit more food.  They always shared their food with guests and the gods.

Mudgala and his family only ate what was left over after they offered food to the gods and their guests.  He was so generous that even when he gave away his food, it seemed to magically get bigger!  He had enough to feed many, many people!

One day, a grumpy old sage named Durvasa came to visit. He looked messy and spoke rudely.  He was very hungry! Mudgala welcomed him warmly and offered him food. Durvasa ate everything!  Then Mudgala gave him more!  Durvasa ate that too, and even made a mess!  This happened again and again for six visits!  Each time, Mudgala stayed calm and kind. He never got angry, even though Durvasa was very rude.

Durvasa was amazed! He’d never met anyone so patient and kind. He told Mudgala, “You are the best! You are so generous and good, even when you are hungry.  You are amazing!”  Durvasa was so impressed with Mudgala’s kindness and generosity that he praised him highly.  He said that Mudgala was a truly special person.

Suddenly, a beautiful chariot pulled by swans and cranes appeared! It was a messenger from the gods!  The messenger told Mudgala, "You've been so good, you get to go to heaven!"

But Mudgala wasn't ready to go yet. He asked the messenger about heaven. He wanted to know what it was like before he went there.  He wanted to know everything – the good and the bad. He wanted to make sure it was the right place for him.  The messenger happily told him all about it.  And that's how Mudgala's kindness and patience led him to heaven!
