Once upon a time, a wise man named Vamadeva told a king some important lessons about being a good ruler.  He said, "If a king is unfair to the weak, other people will copy him.  This makes the kingdom unhappy and can lead to its downfall. But if a king is good and fair, everyone will follow his example!"

Vamadeva explained that a good king should always do what's right, even if it's hard. He shouldn't be mean to anyone, even enemies he's defeated in battle.  He should be brave and strong when there's danger. A kind king, who helps people, will always be happy and successful.

The wise man continued, "Always be honest and helpful. Don't be mean or angry.  Don't rush into things, and don't hold grudges.  Don't get too happy when things are good or too sad when things are bad.  Always remember to take care of your people, even when you have little money."

A good king chooses helpful friends.  He picks smart and honest people to help him rule. He shouldn't choose lazy or mean people for important jobs!  A good king protects himself and his people. He should also secretly watch what other kings are doing, to stay safe.

Vamadeva warned, "Even if an enemy is far away, he might still attack you.  A strong king should fight weaker neighbors, but never stronger ones. A good king always fights fairly, protects his people, and is always ready to fight for his kingdom."

He said, "Nothing lasts forever.  So a king should always do what is right. He needs to protect his kingdom, fight battles, help his people, and make wise decisions.  He can't do everything himself, so he should ask for help from his advisors."

The best kings are kind and share what they have. They listen to good advice and follow it.  They should be careful of dangerous people, such as angry ministers or bad friends. They should never trust people who are only nice because they are afraid. Even a kind king needs to sometimes deal with his enemies, even if they are weak!

Finally, Vamadeva said that a truly great king is fair, kind, and wise, and always remembers that it's his duty to look after his people.
