Once upon a time, in a great battle, Bhishma, a powerful warrior, fought against the Pandavas.  He was very strong! He shot many arrows. He hit Bhima twelve times, Satyaki nine, Nakula three, Sahadeva seven, and Yudhishthira twelve!  He even hit Dhrishtadyumna!

The Pandavas fought back. Nakula shot Dhrishma twelve times, Satyaki three, and Dhrishtadyumna a whopping seventy arrows! Bhima shot seven and Yudhishthira twelve.  Even Drona, another strong warrior, joined the fight, shooting five sharp arrows at Bhima and Satyaki, who each shot three back.

Many soldiers fought bravely, but Bhishma was incredibly strong. He kept shooting his arrows and many soldiers fell.  He was like a fire, burning through the Pandava army. His chariot was like a fiery furnace, his bow the flames, his arrows the sparks, and he himself the fire!  The battlefield was filled with broken chariots, fallen soldiers, and dead elephants.  It was a terrible sight!

The Pandavas' army was scared and started to run.  Krishna, Arjuna's friend and a very powerful person, saw this. He told Arjuna, "This is your chance! You said you would defeat Bhishma. Now is the time!"

Arjuna felt sad. He didn't want to fight Bhishma. But Krishna urged him.  Arjuna finally agreed. He shot an arrow, breaking Bhishma's bow.  Bhishma got a new bow, but Arjuna broke that one too!  Bhishma praised Arjuna's skill.

Bhishma kept shooting arrows, but Krishna, driving Arjuna's chariot, was very clever and avoided them all.  Then, Krishna, filled with anger, jumped from the chariot to attack Bhishma! Everyone was shocked.  Bhishma, however, was brave and welcomed Krishna's attack.

But before Krishna could fight Bhishma, Arjuna stopped him. Arjuna said, "I'll fight Bhishma.  Let me defeat him.  I promised."  Krishna listened to his friend.

Bhishma continued fighting, and the battle raged on.  He was so strong, he pushed the Pandavas back again.  The sun set, and the tired soldiers stopped fighting.  It had been a very long and difficult day.
