Once upon a time, long ago, there was a big snake sacrifice.  King Janamejaya was performing it, and all the snakes were scared!

A wise old snake named Elapatra spoke to the other snakes.  "We can't stop this sacrifice," he said. "It's our fate.  But there's hope!"

Elapatra explained what he remembered from a long time ago.  He had heard the gods talking to Brahma, the great god who created the world.  The gods were worried about all the mean, poisonous snakes.  They asked Brahma why he let Kadru, the snake mother, curse her children.

Brahma explained, "Many snakes were mean and bit people for no reason. But those who were good would be safe.  One day, a great wise man named Jaratkaru will have a son named Astika. Astika will save the good snakes from the sacrifice."

Brahma also said,  "Jaratkaru will marry Vasuki's sister, also named Jaratkaru. Their son will be Astika, and he will save you all!"

Elapatra said to the snake king, Vasuki, "I know a woman named Jaratkaru, your sister!  We must give her to Jaratkaru the wise man so he can have a son and save us all!"

So the snakes hoped that this would save them from the scary sacrifice.
