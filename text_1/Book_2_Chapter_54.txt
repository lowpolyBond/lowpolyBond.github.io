One sunny morning, after sleeping under a big banyan tree, Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita started walking.  They were going to where two big rivers, the Ganga and Yamuna, meet.

The forest was beautiful!  Rama and Lakshmana saw amazing flowers and trees. They even stopped to rest sometimes.  

As the sun began to set, Rama said, "Lakshmana, look!  Smoke!  That means we're near the home of a wise holy man named Bharadvaja!"  They could hear the rushing rivers and knew they were there.  They saw lots of wood that woodcutters had cut.

Soon, they arrived at Bharadvaja's home.  They waited a little way off, then Rama politely went to meet him.

Bharadvaja was a very wise and holy man. He was surrounded by his students, offering prayers to the fire. Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana bowed respectfully.

Rama explained, "We are Rama and Lakshmana, sons of King Dasaratha. This is my wife, Sita. My father sent me to live in the forest, and Lakshmana came with me. We will live simply, eating berries and roots."

Bharadvaja welcomed them warmly. He gave them food and a place to sleep. He was happy to see Rama.  He said, "Rama, I've heard you were sent away unfairly. Stay here, in peace!"

But Rama said, "Thank you, but many people would come to see us here.  Could you tell us about a quiet place where Sita and I can live?"

Bharadvaja said, "Ten miles from here is Cittrakuta mountain. Many holy people live there. It's beautiful, with monkeys, bears, and other animals.  It's a wonderful place!"

So, Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita spent a comfortable night at Bharadvaja's home. The next morning, they thanked Bharadvaja and left for Cittrakuta mountain.  Bharadvaja told them, "Cittrakuta is full of fruit, flowers, elephants, and deer! Itâ€™s the perfect place for you!"

Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita were excited to go to their new home on the beautiful Cittrakuta mountain.
