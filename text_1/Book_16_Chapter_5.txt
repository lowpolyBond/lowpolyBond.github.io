A sad message reached the Pandavas.  Daruka, a messenger, told them terrible news:  Krishna's family, the Vrishnis and their friends, had all died in a great battle.  Everyone had killed each other!

The Pandavas were very, very sad. Arjuna, Krishna's best friend, felt the worst. He knew terrible things were happening. He said goodbye and went to Dwaraka, Krishna's city, with Daruka.

When they arrived, Dwaraka looked awful. It was like a woman who had lost her husband.  All the women were sad and alone.  Krishna had protected them, but now he was gone.  Sixteen thousand women were married to Krishna's family. They cried when they saw Arjuna.

Arjuna couldn't even look at them. He was crying too.  The river looked strange.  It used to be filled with happy sounds of carts and music. Now it looked like a scary river of death.

Arjuna saw beautiful Dwaraka as a sad, empty place, like a flower in winter.  He cried and fell to the ground.  Krishna's wives, Rukmini and Satya, cried with him.  They helped him up and gave him a golden seat to sit on.  Arjuna talked to them and comforted them. He praised Krishna and told them how much he loved him.  Then, Arjuna went to see his uncle.
