Once upon a time, in a great battle, something terrible happened.  A wise man, very clever and knowing much about the past, present, and future, rushed to the king. He was very sad.

He told King Dhritarashtra, "Bhishma, the grandfather of the Kuru princes, is dead!"

Another man, Sanjaya, spoke to the king. He said, "Great King, I have bad news. Bhishma, the strong and brave grandfather, is dead. He fought so bravely!  He fought with his bow and arrows like a mighty warrior.  He was so strong, he even fought Rama, a very powerful warrior, and Rama couldn't defeat him! But today, Sikhandin defeated him. Bhishma is lying on the battlefield, surrounded by arrows.  He was like the great king Indra, so brave and strong. He was so patient and calm, like the Earth. But he is gone."

Sanjaya continued, "Bhishma was amazing!  He killed thousands of warriors every day! For ten days, he protected your army.  But now, he lies on the ground like a big tree blown down by a strong wind. This is because of your bad decisions, O King."  The king was very sad.  Bhishma, his great warrior, was gone.
