Gandhari was very sad.  All her one hundred sons were dead!  Bhima, a powerful warrior, had killed them all in battle with his big club.

But that wasn't the worst part.  Gandhari's daughters-in-law, her sons' wives, were even more heartbroken.  They were young and now all alone. Their husbands were gone.  They used to walk on soft carpets in beautiful houses, wearing pretty jewelry. Now, they walked on the bloody battlefield, their hair messy and their hearts broken.  They were scared of the vultures and wild dogs.

One daughter-in-law, Lakshmana's mother, fell to the ground, crying. Gandhari felt terrible seeing her like that.  Many other women cried too.  They held onto the bodies of their dead husbands, brothers, and sons. They were so tired; they rested against broken chariots and dead animals. One woman even held her husband's head, which still had pretty earrings.

Gandhari cried, "We must have done bad things in our past lives!  All our family is dead because of the war.  Good or bad, our actions always have consequences!"

She pointed to her sons' wives. They were beautiful and kind, but now they were sad and scared. Their faces were hot from the sun. The beautiful things her sons had – their shiny shields, golden armor, and bright flags – were all scattered on the ground. It looked sad and awful.

One of Gandhari's sons, Duhshasana, was dead too. Bhima killed him.  Duhshasana had been very mean to Draupadi, the Pandavas' wife, a long time ago.  He had been cruel and insulted her.  Gandhari had even warned her son, Duryodhana, to be kind and make peace, but he didn't listen.  Duhshasana lay on the ground, his arms stretched out.  Bhima was very angry and even drank Duhshasana's blood!  Gandhari was heartbroken and filled with grief.
