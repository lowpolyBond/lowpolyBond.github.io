Once upon a time, a brave giant vulture named Jatayu tried to save Sita.  Jatayu was a friend of Sita's father-in-law, King Dasaratha.  He saw the mean King Ravana carrying Sita away!

Jatayu shouted, "Let Sita go!  You can't take her while I'm alive!"  He fought Ravana bravely.  Jatayu scratched and pecked Ravana, making him bleed.  But Ravana was strong. He cut off Jatayu's wings and killed him.  Poor Jatayu!

Sita was very sad.  As Ravana flew away with her, Sita dropped her jewels along the way, hoping someone would find them and know where she was.  She even dropped a beautiful yellow cloth for some monkeys to see.

Meanwhile, Rama, Sita's husband, was looking for her. He'd been tricked by a magical deer.  He found his brother Lakshmana and scolded him for leaving Sita alone.  Rama was heartbroken and worried.

On their way, they found Jatayu, dying.  Jatayu told them Ravana had flown south with Sita.  Rama gave Jatayu a proper burial, because he was a friend of his father.

Rama and Lakshmana followed Ravanaâ€™s trail. They saw a scary, headless monster! The monster was so big and strong, he grabbed Lakshmana. Lakshmana was scared, but Rama fought bravely. They worked together and killed the monster.

The monster turned out to be a magical being named Viswavasu, who was under a spell.  He told Rama that Ravana had taken Sita to his city, Lanka. He advised Rama to find Sugriva, a monkey king, for help.  Sugriva would help Rama get Sita back! Rama and Lakshmana were ready for their next adventure.
