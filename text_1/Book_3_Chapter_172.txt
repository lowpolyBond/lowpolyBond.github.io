Arjuna, the great warrior, was flying in a magical chariot.  He saw a sparkling city in the sky! It shimmered like the sun.  This amazing city was made of jewels and had beautiful trees with gem-like fruits.  Pretty birds sang sweet songs.  Strong Asuras, or demons, lived there. They wore flowers and carried swords and bows.

Arjuna asked his chariot driver, Matali, "What is this wonderful place?"

Matali explained, "Long ago, two powerful demon women, Pulama and Kalaka, were given a magical gift.  They got a beautiful flying city, Hiranyapura, that couldn't be destroyed by anyone – not even gods or other demons!  Only a human could destroy it."

Arjuna said, "I will defeat these wicked demons!"

Matali took Arjuna to the city. The demons attacked! They threw spears and swords.  Arjuna fought bravely. He shot many arrows, and the demons started bumping into each other.  He cut off many heads with his fiery arrows.

The demons, scared, zoomed their city all over the place! Up, down, sideways, even underwater!  Arjuna kept shooting his arrows. Finally, he shot so many that the city crashed to the ground!  Many demons were hurt.

Then, more demons came in chariots to fight Arjuna. He fought them with amazing arrows.  Arjuna was scared, though!  So many demons! He prayed to a powerful god.  He got a super-powerful weapon called the Raudra.

When Arjuna threw the Raudra,  lots of animals and monsters appeared – lions, tigers, elephants, even ghosts!  These creatures helped him defeat the remaining demons. The demons were hurt and scared, their city was gone!

The demons' wives cried when they saw what happened to their families and their home. The beautiful city disappeared like a cloud.

Arjuna was a hero! Matali took him back to the gods. Indra, the king of the gods, was very happy. He praised Arjuna. He said Arjuna was the bravest warrior ever!  Because of his bravery,  Arjuna's brother Yudhisthira would rule the whole kingdom.
