Once upon a time, a wise king named Vichakhya saw something sad.  He saw a poor bull all hurt and bleeding.  Nearby, cows were crying because they were scared.  Some priests were there, getting ready to kill the animals for a ceremony.

King Vichakhya felt very sorry for the animals. He said, "May all the cows in the world be safe!"  Even though the animals were being killed, he wished them well.

The king then said, "Only people who are mean and don't think about others like to kill animals for their ceremonies.  They just want to be famous.  A truly good person, like Manu, always tries to be kind to everyone."

He explained that people kill animals only because they want something in return.  But true goodness means being kind to everyone, even animals.  If you really want to be good, you should not eat meat or drink alcohol.  These things weren't even part of the old, good religious rules.  People only do them because they are greedy or mistaken.

King Vichakhya said, "Real priests know that God is everywhere, even in a religious ceremony. We should offer God nice food, pretty flowers, and clean things â€“ things from nature."

Then, a prince named Yudhishthira asked a question. "If we don't want to hurt anyone, how can we stay alive and healthy? Our bodies need food, and life is full of danger!"

The wise Bhishma answered, "You should try to be good and kind. But you also need to take care of yourself.  Eat good food, stay safe, and keep your body strong.  Don't let yourself get hurt, but always remember to be kind."
