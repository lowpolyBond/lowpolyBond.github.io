Once upon a time, in the great war of the Mahabharata, a powerful warrior named Drona agreed to lead the Kaurava army.  Drona was super-smart! He knew everything about fighting and magic weapons. He promised to fight hard but said he couldn't kill Arjuna, the son of Pandu, because it wasn't his destiny.  He would win the battle for the Kauravas though, and defeat their enemies. The Kauravas were very happy. They celebrated with loud music and dancing!

Then Drona organized the Kaurava army.  He put strong warriors on the right side, led by Duryodhana.  On the left, there were even more strong warriors.  Karna, the son of Surya (the sun god) was in the middle, at the back of the army.  His flag was so bright it looked like the sun! Everyone felt excited and brave seeing Karna. They thought the Pandavas didn't stand a chance.  Drona’s army looked like a huge cart, all organized and ready.  

The Pandavas’ army, led by Arjuna, looked like a crane, strong and ready to strike. Arjuna's flag was even brighter! He had his special bow, Gandiva, and his mighty chariot.  Arjuna and Karna, the two best warriors, glared at each other.  They were both ready to fight.

When the battle began, the ground shook!  Dust filled the air.  It looked like it was raining blood and bones!  Scary birds circled above, and bad omens filled the sky.  It was a terrible and noisy battle.  Drona was amazing! He shot so many arrows, that the Pandava army almost broke.  But Arjuna and his friends fought back bravely. They shot arrows too. The battle was back and forth. Drona fought like a raging fire, sweeping across the Pandava lines.  He was strong, and terrifying,  on his magnificent chariot, ready to destroy everyone.  It was a very, very scary and amazing sight!
