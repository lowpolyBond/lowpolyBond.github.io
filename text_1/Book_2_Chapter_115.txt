Bharata was very sad. His brother Rama had gone to the forest.  Bharata brought his mothers back home to Ayodhya.  Then he spoke to the wise Guru Vasishtha and the other elders.

"I want to go to Nandigrama," Bharata said. "I'll wait there for Rama to come back.  He is the real king of Ayodhya."

The elders said, "Bharata, you love your brother so much! We agree. Go ahead."

Bharata told his friend Sumantra, "Get the chariot!"

Bharata and his brother Shatrughna climbed into the chariot.  Many people followed them—priests, soldiers, and even elephants! Bharata carried Rama's sandals on his head.  He showed everyone how much he loved Rama.

When they reached Nandigrama, Bharata placed Rama's sandals on the king's throne.  He spoke to the people.

"These sandals are like Rama himself," Bharata said.  "Treat them like a king!  I will rule until Rama returns. Then I'll give him back his kingdom, and serve him."

Bharata wore simple clothes and let his hair grow long. He ruled from Nandigrama, but he treated Rama's sandals like they were the king.  He always asked what Rama would do before making any decisions.

Every important decision started with Bharata showing respect to Rama’s sandals. Any gifts meant for the king were first offered to the sandals. Bharata was a loyal brother, always remembering Rama. He waited patiently for his brother’s return.
