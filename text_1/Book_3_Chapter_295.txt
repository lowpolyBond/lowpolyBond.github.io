Once upon a time, there lived a kind man named Satyavan and his loving wife, Savitri.  One day, Satyavan went to gather fruits in the forest.  He worked hard, chopping wood and filling his bag.  Soon, he got a bad headache and felt very tired.

"Savitri, I'm not feeling well," he said. "My head hurts terribly. I need to rest."

Savitri gently helped him lie down, resting his head on her lap.  She remembered something a wise man had told her, and she started to watch carefully.

Suddenly, a scary-looking man appeared! He was tall and dark, with red eyes and a rope. He was Yama, the god of death!

"Satyavan's time has come," Yama said. "I'm here to take him."

Savitri was brave.  She asked Yama, "Why have you come yourself? Don't you usually send messengers?"

Yama was impressed by Savitri's devotion to her husband. He explained that Satyavan was so good, he came himself. Yama then took Satyavan's life force, leaving his body still.

Savitri was heartbroken, but she wouldn't give up. She followed Yama, asking him for boons (special wishes).  First, she asked for her blind father-in-law to see again and be strong. Yama granted her wish.

Then, she asked for her father-in-law to get his kingdom back.  Yama granted this wish too.

Next, Savitri asked for her childless father to have a hundred sons. Yama agreed.

Savitri kept walking and talking to Yama. She spoke about the importance of being good and kind, even to enemies. She spoke about how good people help each other.  Yama was very impressed by her wisdom.

He gave her one more chance for a boon. "Ask anything, except for Satyavan's life," he said.  

"I can't have a hundred sons without my husband," Savitri said.  "I need Satyavan back! Without him, I don't want anything!"

Yama was so moved by her love and devotion that he brought Satyavan back to life!  Satyavan woke up in Savitri's lap. He was so happy to be alive and reunited with his wonderful wife. They returned to Satyavan's parents, and Yama gave them many more blessings.  Savitri and Satyavan lived happily ever after, with many children and a long life together.
