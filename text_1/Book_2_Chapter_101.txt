Bharata was very sad.  He heard Rama, his older brother, talking. Bharata said, "Being king doesn't matter to me. I'm not good enough!"

In our family, the younger brother can't be king while the older brother is alive.  So, Rama, please come back to Ayodhya with me!  Be our king!  A king isn't just a man; he's like a god, because he does what's right and good.

Remember when you went to the forest? Our father, King Dasaratha, was very sad. He missed Rama so much.  He died from sadness!  Shatrughna and I already did a special ceremony for our father.  But you, Rama, must also do it.  A son's offering helps their father in heaven.  Our father loved you so much, Rama. He thought of you all the time until he died. Please come home.
