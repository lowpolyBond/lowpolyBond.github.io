Once upon a time, a wise man named Rishi was sitting quietly.  King Parikshit, a hunter, was searching for a deer he'd shot.  He was tired and hungry. He found Rishi and kept asking about the deer, but Rishi couldn't answer because he was taking a special silent vow.

King Parikshit, not knowing about the vow, put a dead snake on Rishi's shoulder as a joke, using his bow.  Rishiâ€™s son, Sringin, found out.  He was very, very angry!

Sringin was super strong because he was a holy man. He shouted, "That king was mean!  A snake will bite him and he will die in seven days!"

Sringin cursed King Parikshit.  Then he went to see his father. He was still upset. He cried.

Rishi, his father, said, "Son, you shouldn't have done that!  The king didn't mean to be unkind. He was tired and didn't know about my vow.  Kings are important. They keep everyone safe. We should forgive them, even when they make mistakes.  If we don't forgive, we could be hurting others."

Rishi explained that a king protects everyone and helps everyone live peacefully.  He said the king was just tired and hungry.  He didn't mean to be rude.  Rishi told Sringin that cursing the king was wrong.  He said it was important to be kind and forgiving.
