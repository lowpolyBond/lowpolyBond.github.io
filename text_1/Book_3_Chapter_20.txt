Once upon a time, after a big party celebrating King Yudhishthira's victory, Vasudeva went back to his city, Dwaraka.  But oh no!  The city was sad and quiet.  The people looked unhappy, the gardens were dull, and no one was singing or celebrating.

Vasudeva asked a brave warrior, Kritavarman, "What happened? Why is everyone so sad?"

Kritavarman explained that a mean giant named Salwa had attacked Dwaraka! He’d caused lots of trouble before disappearing.

Vasudeva said, "I will defeat Salwa!" He cheered up the people of Dwaraka and told the other brave warriors, "Stay here and keep everyone safe. I'm going to find Salwa and stop him! I will return only after he’s defeated!"

Vasudeva got into his chariot, pulled by strong horses, and blew a powerful horn. His army followed him.  They traveled far and wide, crossing rivers and mountains. Finally, they found Salwa near the ocean in his shiny, golden chariot.

Salwa was a bad guy. He started shooting hundreds and thousands of arrows at Vasudeva and his army! It was a huge battle.  Vasudeva fought bravely but it was hard to see because Salwa's arrows were everywhere.  The army couldn't even see Vasudeva, his chariot, or his driver!

Salwa used magic tricks too. He made the sky dark and light, hot and cold! He threw all kinds of weapons, even mountains! But Vasudeva used his own magic to fight back.

Finally, Vasudeva used his strongest weapon, and it was so powerful that it defeated Salwa's magic.  The battle was fierce and exciting!  The sky shone brightly with many suns, moons, and stars, making it hard to tell day from night.

After a long and difficult battle, Vasudeva was ready to defeat Salwa, but this is where our story ends for now.  What will happen next? We shall see!
