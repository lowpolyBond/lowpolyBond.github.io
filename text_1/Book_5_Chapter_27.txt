Sanjaya said, "Yudhishthira, everyone knows you're a good person.  I see that too.  Life is short, and it can end badly. Don't throw your life away!  If the Kauravas won't share fairly without a fight, it’s better to live simply, even begging, than to win a kingdom through war.

Life is short, it's full of trouble, and it's not as important as having a good name.  Never do anything wrong.  Bad wishes keep people from being good.  A wise person gets rid of those bad wishes and becomes famous for being good.

Wanting lots of money is like being chained. People who want only money aren't happy.  It's much better to want to be good.  Being good makes you shine like the sun!  Even if someone gets everything in the world, being bad will bring them trouble.

You've studied holy books, lived like a saint, given to the poor, and enjoyed yourself. But spending all your time having fun, and not thinking about what’s good, makes you unhappy.  When your money is gone, you'll still want more fun, and that’s sad. People who only think about fun, and don’t live well, don’t believe in a better life after this one. They have a bad time after they die.

What you do in this life matters.  Good and bad actions follow you after you die.  You’ve done many good things!  Everyone says you're like a delicious meal offered to the gods.   You can only act in this life; after death, there's nothing more to do.  Your good actions will bring you happiness after death – a place without sickness, hunger, or fear.  It's a place of happiness and enjoyment.  It's all about what you do now.

Don't let your wishes lead you to war.  Don't give up being honest and kind.  You could have great ceremonies, but don’t do anything wrong! You spent years living simply in the forest. Was that all for nothing? You had a strong army, loyal friends like Krishna and Satyaki, and powerful allies. You could have defeated your enemies long ago! Why did you let them get stronger? Why did you wait so long? Fighting might help a bad person, but it will hurt a good person. You're a good person; you don’t act out of anger.

Why are you about to fight now? Anger is like a bitter poison. It hurts your reputation and makes you do bad things. Good people control their anger.  Give up your anger and stop the war!  If you fight, you’ll kill Bhishma, Drona, Karna, and many others.  Even if you won the whole world, you’ll still get old and die, and you’ll still feel sadness and happiness.  Knowing this, why fight?  If your friends are telling you to fight, just leave and go somewhere safe. Don't choose a path that leads to trouble. Don't do this!"
