Once upon a time, a king named Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, about the importance of offering flowers, incense, and lights to the gods. He wanted to know why people gave special food offerings called "Valis."

Bhishma said, "Let me tell you a story about Nahusha, a king who became the ruler of heaven! Nahusha was a good king. He always offered flowers, incense, lights, and Valis to the gods. He prayed and meditated every day, even though he was already in heaven!"

But then, Nahusha became proud.  He forgot to offer things to the gods. He even made wise holy men carry him around like a chair! One of these holy men was Agastya.

Another holy man, Bhrigu, saw this and was very angry. He told Agastya, "This is wrong! Nahusha is being mean! We should do something!"

Agastya was worried. "Nahusha has a special magical power. Nobody can stop him!" he said.

Bhrigu said, "Don't worry! I will help. Nahusha's pride will be his downfall.  I will make him pay for being so rude. I will curse him!"

So, Bhrigu waited. When Nahusha was mean to Agastya, Bhrigu used his magic.  He cursed Nahusha, and Nahusha turned into a snake!  He fell from heaven.

Bhishma finished his story and said, "Thatâ€™s why it is important to always be humble and kind, and to remember to give offerings to the gods. It keeps us from becoming proud and doing bad things."  Yudhishthira understood.  He learned that even a powerful king could fall if he forgot to be thankful and respectful.
