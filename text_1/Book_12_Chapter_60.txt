Once upon a time, Yudhishthira, a very good king, asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, some important questions.  He wanted to know what everyone should do to be good.

Bhishma, who was very wise and kind, said he'd explain. He said that everyone, no matter who they were, should try to:

* Not get angry.
* Tell the truth.
* Be fair.
* Forgive others.
* Have a family.
* Be clean and good.
* Not fight.
* Be simple.
* Take care of those who need help.

Then Bhishma explained what each group of people should do:

**Brahmins (Priests and Scholars):**  Brahmins should be calm and study holy books. They should be patient and strong.  If they get rich, they should share it with others and have families.  Studying holy books is their most important job.

**Kshatriyas (Warriors and Rulers):** Kshatriyas should be brave warriors who protect people and fight bad guys.  They should give things away, not ask for them. They should be strong and win battles, but it’s also important to be wise and learn.  Their most important job is keeping everyone safe.

**Vaisyas (Farmers and Merchants):** Vaisyas should be farmers and traders.  They should be kind to their animals and share their wealth. They should work hard and be honest.  Taking care of animals is very important for them.  They get paid for their work, like a farmer might get a share of the harvest.

**Sudras (Workers and Servants):** Sudras should work hard and help the other groups.  They should be loyal to their masters.  They are supposed to be helped by everyone else.  It’s important to be loyal and take care of your masters, even if they are poor. Even Sudras should try to pray and be kind.

Bhishma said that everyone, even Sudras, should pray and try their best to be good.  He said that being good and helping others is the most important thing, more than anything else in the world.  He said that prayer and kindness are the best things anyone can do.
