Once upon a time, a wise man named Narada talked to a powerful god named Narayana. Narada had been very good. He always respected his elders, told the truth, helped others, and was kind to everyone. He asked Narayana to let him see Narayana's true form. Narayana, happy with Narada, said, "Go ahead!"

Narada flew high up into the sky and saw a magical island far away, called the White Island.  It was in a sea of milk.  The people on this island were special. They didn't need to eat or sleep.  They always smelled nice and were super strong. They were so pure that if a bad person looked at them, it would hurt their eyes!

King Yudhishthira heard this story and was very curious. He asked Bhishma, a very old and wise man, how those people were born and what made them so special.

Bhishma explained that long, long ago, there was a kind king named Uparichara. He was a great friend of the gods. He was very, very good. He always worshipped the gods and helped everyone.  He shared his food and his riches. He never did anything wrong.

Seven very wise saints, known as the Chitra-sikhandins, wanted to teach people how to be good. They prayed to Narayana for a very long time. Narayana was pleased and helped them write a special book about how to live a good life. This book told everyone how to be happy and good.

The saints taught King Uparichara how to use this book. The King was so good and followed the book's rules, that he became very powerful and happy.  But when he died, this special book disappeared.  The story of the White Island and its people is part of this special book, showing what goodness can create!
