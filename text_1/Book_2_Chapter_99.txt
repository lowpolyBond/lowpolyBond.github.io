Bharata was excited! He wanted to find his brother Rama's home in the forest.  He showed his brother Shatrughna and their friend Sumantra where to go.  They all wanted to see Rama.

Bharata looked around. He saw a little hut made of leaves.  There were broken sticks and flowers near it.  Rama and Lakshmana had tied special grass and cloth to trees to mark their path.  He even saw piles of dried animal dung – fuel for the winter!

"This is it!" Bharata said. "This is where Sage Bharadvaja said Rama would be! I can see the smoke from their fire.  And look – Lakshmana tied cloth to the trees so he could find his way back at night!"

They walked a little further and reached a river. "Rama is here," Bharata said sadly.  "He's living in this lonely forest.  It's all my fault! Because of me, Rama is so unhappy."

Bharata found Rama's hut. It was cozy, covered with leaves and branches.  He saw Rama's bows and arrows, and his shiny shields.  It was like a warrior's camp!

Then Bharata saw Rama! He was sitting near a small fire. Rama looked strong and peaceful, but also sad. Sita and Lakshmana were with him.

Bharata's heart broke.  He cried, "My brother!  You, who should be in a palace, are here in the forest! You used to wear beautiful clothes, now you wear just leaves. It's my fault!"

Bharata was so sad, he fainted!  He fell to the ground before he could even touch Rama's feet.  Shatrughna also cried and hugged Rama's feet.  Rama hugged them both and cried too.

Sumantra and Guha came to see them.  The whole forest seemed happy that the brothers were together again. Everyone cried happy tears!
