King Yayati was a good king. He gave lots of gifts and did many good deeds.  The gods sent him to heaven!  He was showered with flowers and everyone welcomed him with music and dancing.

But Yayati was very proud. He thought he was better than everyone else.  Because of his pride, the gods couldn't even recognize him!  They sent him back to Earth.

Yayati's grandchildren, his daughter's sons, were very kind.  They helped him get back to heaven.  This time, the gods saw him and welcomed him again.

The Great God Brahma talked to Yayati.  "Your good deeds got you to heaven," he said. "But your pride pushed you away. Pride is a bad thing, Yayati.  It blinds you and makes others dislike you.  Only good deeds, not pride, can keep you in heaven."

Yayati was sad. He asked, "But I did so many good things! How could just pride take it all away?"

Brahma explained, "Even a mountain of good deeds can be destroyed by one small bad thing, like pride.  Never look down on anyone, whether they are richer or poorer than you. Pride is a terrible thing."

Narada, a wise storyteller, then told the king, "Yayati's story teaches us a lesson.  Be humble, not proud. Don't be stubborn like Galava, who also suffered because of his stubbornness. Listen to your friends, be kind to everyone, and make peace."

Narada continued, "King, good deeds never disappear.  They always bring happiness. If you are kind and do good things, you'll be happy and successful. This story teaches us how important kindness and humility are.  If you understand this, you will be wise and happy!"
