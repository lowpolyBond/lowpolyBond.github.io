Once upon a time, there lived a princess named Kunti.  A powerful sun god, Surya, saw her and wanted her to be his wife.  Kunti was scared!  She tried to say no nicely, but Surya was very strong.

Kunti was worried about her family. She thought, "How can I keep my family safe from the sun god's anger?"  She felt so confused and afraid. She didn't want to disobey the sun god, but she also didn't want to do anything wrong.  She was worried what her friends and family would think.

With a shaky voice, Kunti asked Surya, "Sir, I don't want to do anything wrong.  This would hurt my family's good name. If you think this is okay, then I will do as you ask. But please, let me stay pure."

Surya smiled kindly. He said, "A young girl is free to choose. It's not wrong for you to do as I ask. I only want what's good for everyone. You will stay pure, and you will have a strong and brave son."

Kunti then asked, "If I have a son, could he be strong and handsome, like you, with magical armor and earrings?"

Surya agreed. He said, "Your son will be strong, with magical armor and earrings made from special magic stuff! He'll be invincible!"

Kunti finally agreed.  The sun god, using his special powers, gently entered Kunti. She felt very sleepy and passed out.

When Kunti woke up, the sun god was gone.  He had given her a son, but he hadn't hurt her. Kunti was still pure and good. Her son would be very special indeed!
