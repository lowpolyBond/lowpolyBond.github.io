King Yudhishthira asked his wise advisor, Bhishma, "What should a good king do to be happy and rule well?"

Bhishma said, "I'll tell you a story, Yudhishthira.  Long ago, there was a very big camel.  This camel was super-strong and had magic powers. He was so good, a magical being gave him a wish!

The camel wished for a super-long neck, so long he could reach food miles and miles away!  His wish came true!  But the camel became lazy. He just lay around and used his long neck to reach food without even trying.

One day, a big storm came. The camel hid in a cave.  A hungry jackal and his wife also ran into the cave to get out of the rain.  The jackal was so hungry, he started eating the camel's long neck while it was hiding!  The camel tried to pull his neck back, but the jackal wouldn't let go.  The jackal kept eating until the camel died!

That's why, Yudhishthira, you must *never* be lazy.  A smart king uses their brain, not just their strength. Being clever is the best way to win!   Think carefully before you act.  Listen to good advice.  Have friends to help you. That's how a king becomes great and keeps his kingdom strong."
