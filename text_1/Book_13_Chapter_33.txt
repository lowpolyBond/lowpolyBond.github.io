King Yudhishthira asked his grandpa Bhishma, "Grandpa, what's the most important thing a king should do to be happy in this life and the next?"

Bhishma smiled. "My dear Yudhishthira," he said, "the most important thing is to respect and honor wise Brahmins.  Brahmins are very learned people, like teachers. They know a lot about the world and how to live a good life."

"A king should treat Brahmins with kindness," Bhishma continued. "He should give them gifts, speak nicely to them, and always show them respect.  Imagine your kingdom as a beautiful garden.  Happy Brahmins make the whole kingdom bloom!"

Bhishma explained that Brahmins are incredibly powerful.  He said some were very gentle, like soft cotton, while others were strict, like a roaring storm. Some were clever, others were kind, and still others even did things like farming or begging for food! Some were even like mischievous friends, always playing jokes. They were all different, but all important.

"Their power is like magic," Bhishma said. "When they are happy, the kingdom thrives.  But if they are angry, bad things can happen!"

Bhishma warned Yudhishthira, "Never, ever hurt or disrespect a Brahmin.  It's the worst thing a king could do.  It's like trying to catch the wind or touch the moon â€“ impossible! You can't win against them.  It's even worse than hurting many other people."

"Some kingdoms have lost their greatness because they didn't respect Brahmins," Bhishma said sadly. "Always remember, a king's happiness depends on respecting his wise Brahmins."  He ended with a big smile, "Treat them well, and your kingdom will flourish!"
