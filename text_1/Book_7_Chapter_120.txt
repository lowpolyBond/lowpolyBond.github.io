King Dhritarashtra was watching the battle.  He saw Satyaki, a brave warrior, fighting all by himself against a huge army.  He was so strong! He asked Sanjaya, his advisor, “Sanjaya, what did my sons do? Satyaki was so powerful, why didn't they fight back? How could one warrior defeat so many?”

Dhritarashtra was worried. He said, "It looks like fate is against my sons.  Satyaki is like a lion hunting small animals; he’s defeating even the best warriors!  My army is no match for him!” He even suggested that the Pandavas (his enemies) should stop fighting!

Sanjaya explained, “King, this is all because of your bad advice and Duryodhana’s (Dhritarashtra’s son) bad actions.  Duryodhana ordered his army to attack Satyaki. Thousands of soldiers, archers, and even elephant riders rushed at him like ants on a big cookie!”

Satyaki fought bravely. He was alone, but he fought like a hero!  He defeated thousands of soldiers.  The battlefield was covered with broken chariots, dead elephants, and scattered weapons. It looked like a huge mess!

Then, Duryodhana sent even more soldiers – warriors who were experts at throwing stones.  They threw huge stones at Satyaki, but he was so quick! He used his arrows to break the stones into pieces, and the broken pieces hurt many of Duryodhana's men.  Thousands more soldiers were defeated!

The battle was so loud, even Drona, the great warrior, heard it. Drona asked his driver, “What’s all that noise?  It sounds like Satyaki is destroying our army!  Let’s go see what’s happening.”

His driver said, “Sir, our soldiers are running away!  Satyaki is too strong!  The Pandavas are also coming to attack you!”  Drona didn’t know what to do first!  By then, Satyaki was already winning. Duryodhana's soldiers were so scared, they ran away to where Drona was!
