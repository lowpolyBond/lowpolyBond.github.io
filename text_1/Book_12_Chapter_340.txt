Once upon a time, a wise man named Narada wanted to see God.  He prayed very hard.  Then, God, who is called Narayana, appeared!

Narayana was amazing! He was so beautiful! He had a thousand eyes, a hundred heads, a hundred feet, a thousand arms, and a thousand stomachs! His skin shimmered with all the colors of the rainbow – like a parrot's feathers, shiny crystal, gold, coral, and even sapphires!  He was so wonderful, it was hard to even imagine him.  He spoke the magic word "Om" and then chanted beautiful prayers. He held a special bowl, some pretty gems, and other holy things.

Narada was so happy! He bowed down to God. Narayana said, "Only people who love me with all their hearts can see me. You are one of those people, Narada."  He showed Narada some special people, who were very holy and always thought about God.

Narayana explained that he was everywhere – in the air, the water, the earth, and even in everyone's hearts!  He said he was like the sun, the moon, and the wind. He talked about how the world began and how it would end. He told Narada about how he would help people in many different ways, even becoming a man, an animal, or a god, to fight evil and save the good. He would be born again and again to help those who needed him, like a brave hero in many stories.  He explained that he is the source of everything – the beginning and the end.


Narayana then disappeared. Narada, feeling very lucky, went to tell others about what he had seen. He told everyone about God's amazing power and how he would always be there to help.  The story spread far and wide, because it was a very important and holy story.  Everyone who heard it learned about God's love and power.  And that, my friends, is the story of how Narada saw God.
