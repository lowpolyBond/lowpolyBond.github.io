King Yudhishthira was worried.  He asked his wise uncle Bhishma, "Sometimes, even family and friends become enemies. How can I make everyone happy?"

Bhishma told a story about Krishna, a very important king. Krishna had a big problem.  His family was fighting!  Some liked Akrura, and some liked Ahuka. It was like two brothers arguing over a toy.  Krishna felt sad. He loved them all, but they were divided.

Krishna talked to his wise friend Narada. "I'm surrounded by powerful people," Krishna said. "Some are rich and strong, others are smart and clever, but they are all fighting!  What can I do?"

Narada said, "Krishna, your problem is you let them fight. Your family's fighting is like a fire burning inside you."

Krishna asked, "What can I do to stop this fire?"

Narada said, "Use a special weapon! This weapon isn't a sword or a spear. It's kindness."

"Kindness?" asked Krishna.

"Yes!" Narada explained. "Share your food. Forgive them when they're mean. Be honest and gentle. Always show respect.  Soft words can calm even the angriest people.  It's hard work, but only strong people can do it.  You are strong, Krishna!   If you keep everyone together, your family will be happy and strong."

Krishna listened carefully. He understood.  Being kind was like a strong, invisible shield that could protect his family and bring them all together. He decided to try Narada's advice and show his family kindness.
