Bhima wanted to be king, but his older brother, Yudhishthira, worried.  "Bhima," Yudhishthira said, "you want power too much! You worry too much about things.  Being king is like having only one stomach, but wanting to eat everything.  You can't eat everything!  Your hunger will never be satisfied."

He explained it like this:  "Imagine a fire.  If you keep feeding it wood, it burns brightly.  But if you stop, it goes out.  Your hunger is like a fire.  Eat just enough to stop the fire, not more!"

Yudhishthira continued, "People who want a lot of things are never happy.  A tiger kills many animals to fill its one stomach.  Other animals eat the leftovers.  Kings are like that tiger – always wanting more!"

"Some people are happy with very little," Yudhishthira said. "They eat leaves, or simple food. They are much happier than kings.  It's better to be happy than powerful."

He told Bhima about two paths in life: one for those who want earthly things, and one for those who want peace. Those who are wise and calm choose the path to peace.  They don’t worry about things they can’t control.

"Imagine someone on a high hill," said Yudhishthira.  "They can see how small and unimportant everyone's problems are below. People who are wise see things like that.  They don't worry about small things.  They understand that everything is connected. They see all living things as part of one big thing. That’s the true path to happiness."

Yudhishthira told Bhima, "True happiness doesn't come from power or riches. It comes from being wise and calm, from understanding that everything is connected, and from choosing peace over everything else."
