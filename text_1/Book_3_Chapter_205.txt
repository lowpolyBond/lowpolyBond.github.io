Once upon a time, there was a very wise and holy man named Kausika. He knew all about the Vedas, which are very old and important books. One day, he was reading the Vedas under a tree. A bird pooped on him! Kausika got very, very angry. He glared at the bird, and the bird fell down dead!

Kausika felt terrible.  He said, "Oh, I did a bad thing! I was so angry!"  He felt so sorry. He went to a village to ask for food.

He went to a house he knew.  He asked for food. A woman said, "Wait a minute."  While she was getting the food, her husband came home, very hungry.  The woman gave her husband food and water first. She was a very good wife. She always took care of her husband.  She even ate what was leftover from his plate!

The woman finally remembered the holy man waiting for food. She felt bad that she made him wait. She gave him some food.

But Kausika was still angry! He said, "You should respect holy men more than your husband!"

The woman said, "I'm sorry. My husband is very important to me. He was hungry, and I needed to take care of him first. I didn't mean to disrespect you."

Kausika said,  "Holy men are very powerful!  Even gods respect them. You shouldn't ignore them!"

The woman said, "I know that, but please forgive me. I am not a bird!  Holy men are powerful, but they are also kind and forgiving."  She told him stories about powerful holy men forgiving others. She said that being a good wife was also very important and kind.

The woman told Kausika, "Anger is bad.  A truly holy man is kind and always tells the truth. A truly holy man is calm and kind to everyone.  Go ask a wise man in Mithila what being truly holy means."


Kausika felt ashamed. He said, "You are right. I am sorry. I will be kinder."  He went home, feeling much better. He learned that being kind is just as important as being holy.
