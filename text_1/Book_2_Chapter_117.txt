Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana were sad.  They didn't want to stay where they were anymore.  Bharata's army had been there, and the elephants and horses had made a mess.  So, they decided to leave.

They walked and walked until they reached a wise old man's home.  His name was Sage Atri.  He was very kind. He welcomed Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana.

Sage Atri had a lovely, old wife named Anasuya.  She was very special.  She was so good that she once made rain fall when there was a terrible drought!  Atri asked Sita to stay with Anasuya for a while.

Rama said, "Yes, that's a good idea." He told Sita, "Anasuya is very wise. Spend some time with her."

Sita went to live with Anasuya. Anasuya was very old, her hair was white, and she was a little shaky. But she was very kind. Sita bowed to Anasuya, and Anasuya bowed back.

Anasuya told Sita, "You're lucky to be with your husband, even in the forest.  A good wife always loves and respects her husband, no matter what."

Anasuya said, "Being a good wife is the most important thing.  It doesn't matter if he's rich or poor, happy or sad.  You'll always be happy if you are a good wife to your husband. You will go to a wonderful place after you die."

Sita listened carefully. She knew Anasuya was right.  She was a good wife, and she loved Rama very much.
