King Bhishma was teaching Yudhishthira how to be a good king.  He said the most important thing was to keep his people safe.  Lots of wise people, like Indra (the king of the gods!), wrote about this.

Bhishma explained how to do it:  Use spies to find out secrets. Pay everyone fairly.  Collect taxes kindly, not unfairly. Choose honest helpers. Be brave and clever. Always do what’s best for the people.  Try to make enemies fight amongst themselves. Fix broken buildings.  Punish people fairly. Help good people. Store up food.  Be friends with smart people. Keep soldiers happy. Watch your people carefully.  Be clever with your work and money. Don't trust the city guards too much. Make enemies in enemy cities turn against each other.  Look after your friends who are in enemy territory. Watch your workers closely.  Always know what's happening in your city. Don’t trust everyone completely.  Sometimes, be kind to enemies to trick them.  Always be ready to fight. Never ignore an enemy.  Get rid of bad people.

Bhishma said, "Working hard is the most important thing for a king!  Even the gods worked hard!  A lazy king, even a smart one, will lose to his enemies, like a snake without poison."  He said even a tiny spark can start a big fire, and a tiny bit of poison can kill.  One unhappy person can hurt a whole kingdom.

Bhishma said a king must sometimes keep secrets. He needs to be kind but also clever.  Being too nice can make you weak.  A king needs to be both honest and tricky sometimes.  If a king puts himself in danger to protect his people, that’s very good.

Then, Bhishma said, "That's just a little of what a king should know!"

Everyone there said, "Wow, that was great!" They praised Bhishma. Yudhishthira, feeling sad, touched Bhishma's feet and said he'd ask more questions tomorrow.  Then everyone went to the river, prayed, and went back to their city.
