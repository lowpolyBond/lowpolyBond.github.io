After a big battle, the strong warrior Bhima defeated Duryodhana.  King Dhritarashtra asked his friend Sanjaya, "What happened when Duryodhana was defeated?"

Sanjaya said, "When Bhima defeated Duryodhana, it was like a lion beating a big elephant!  The Pandavas and their friends were so happy! They cheered and shouted.  They jumped and danced!  They beat drums and blew horns. They even praised Bhima, saying, 'You were amazing!  Only you could have defeated Duryodhana!' They said Bhima was as strong as the god Indra who defeated the evil Vritra."

Everyone praised Bhima for his amazing victory.  But then, Krishna, a wise friend of the Pandavas, said, "It's not right to keep talking about it so much.  Duryodhana is dead. We should move on. Let's go home."

But Duryodhana, even though badly hurt, tried to get up! He was angry at Krishna. He said,  "You cheated! You told Bhima how to beat me. You also cheated to defeat Bhishma, Drona, Karna and many others. You weren't fair!"

Krishna answered, "Duryodhana, you and your friends did many bad things. You were unfair to the Pandavas. You didnâ€™t share the kingdom fairly. You tried to burn them. You were mean to Draupadi.  Because of all your bad actions, your army was defeated. We had to use clever tricks to win."

Duryodhana said, "I fought bravely. I lived a king's life. I'm going to heaven now."

As soon as he finished speaking, amazing things happened!  Flowers fell from the sky.  Beautiful music played.  Invisible beings praised Duryodhana.  The Pandavas felt sad. They thought, "Did we really have to cheat?"

Krishna explained, "Those warriors were too strong to beat fairly.  We had to use clever tricks to win. It's how the gods win their battles too. We won! Let's go home now and celebrate."

Then the Pandavas and their friends cheered again, blowing their horns. They were very happy the battle was over.
