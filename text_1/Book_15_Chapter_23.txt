Once upon a time, the Pandavas were going to visit their grandfather, Dhritarashtra.  King Yudhishthira, the oldest Pandava brother, gave the order to march.

"Get ready!" shouted the soldiers.  There was a big, exciting noise! Soldiers got on horses, chariots, and even golden cars that sparkled like fire. Some rode on elephants and camels! Others marched on foot, ready to fight.

Lots of people wanted to see Dhritarashtra, so they followed the Pandavas.  Their teacher, Kripa, led the army.  Yudhishthira rode in a grand chariot, with a white umbrella over him and musicians playing.

Bhima, the strong one, rode a HUGE elephant â€“ it was as big as a mountain!  Nakula and Sahadeva, the twins, rode fast horses.  Arjuna, the best archer, rode in a shining chariot pulled by beautiful white horses.  Draupadi and the other queens rode in covered carriages.  They threw lots of gold coins as they went!

The army was HUGE!  It had lots of elephants, horses, and chariots.  The sound of trumpets and music filled the air. They traveled slowly, resting by pretty rivers and lakes.

Yuyutsu and Dhaumya stayed behind to protect the city.  Finally, Yudhishthira reached Kurukshetra.  He crossed the Yamuna river and saw Dhritarashtra's home in the distance. Everyone was so happy!  They cheered loudly as they entered the forest to visit their grandfather.
