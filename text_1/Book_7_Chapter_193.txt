Sanjaya told the king, "Satyaki, a brave warrior, was fighting very well.  Duryodhana and his friends got angry. They surrounded Satyaki with their armies.  Kripa and Karna, also very strong warriors, attacked him with lots of arrows.

The Pandavas – Yudhishthira, and Madri's sons – rushed to protect Satyaki.  A huge arrow battle began! Satyaki was amazing! He fought back all the arrows using his own special weapons.

The battlefield was terrible!  It was full of broken weapons, dead bodies, and broken chariots. It looked like a big storm!  The ground was covered with arms, legs, and heads.

King Yudhishthira saw this. He told his army, "Attack Drona! He's fighting with Arjuna, and Arjuna is about to win! Let’s all fight together!"

So, the Pandavas' army attacked Drona. Drona was a powerful warrior, and as he fought, the ground shook, the wind blew hard, and even the sky looked scary!  Drona looked tired. He had a feeling he was going to die.

He fought bravely, killing many, many soldiers.  But then, Dhrishtadyumna, a strong warrior, attacked Drona. Both warriors used their strongest magical weapons!  Dhrishtadyumna destroyed Drona’s weapons.

Then Bhima, another Pandava, talked to Drona. Bhima said, "You're a wise teacher.  Why are you fighting this war? Your friend Duryodhana is already losing!"

Drona felt sad. He put down his weapons. He said, "Protect yourselves! I'm giving up."  He closed his eyes and thought peaceful thoughts. He went to heaven!  Only a few people saw him go.

Dhrishtadyumna didn't know Drona had gone to heaven. He cut off Drona's head. This made everyone very upset. The Kaurava army ran away, afraid. The Pandavas won the battle!

Bhima and Dhrishtadyumna hugged each other happily. Bhima said, "We'll celebrate again when we defeat Karna and Duryodhana too!"  The Pandavas were very happy.  The Kauravas were sad and scared."
