Once upon a time, after a huge battle, three brave warriors – Ashwatthama, Kripa, and Kritavarma – found their king, Duryodhana, badly hurt.  He was lying on the ground, his legs broken, bleeding, and surrounded by scary wild animals waiting to eat him!  The three warriors felt very sad.  They pushed the animals away and stayed with Duryodhana, trying to help him.

Kripa, one of the warriors, cried, “Even the great Duryodhana, who commanded a giant army, is now lying on the ground, bleeding!  Look, his beautiful golden mace is beside him.  It never left his side in battle, and now it stays with him even in death. Time is so powerful, it changes everything!”

Ashwatthama, another warrior, also cried.  He said, “Duryodhana, the strongest warrior, was defeated by Bhima.  Bhima wasn't fair! Time is stronger than anything. It’s unfair that Duryodhana is hurt so badly and that the Pandavas just stood there and watched!”  He also felt bad for Duryodhana's parents, who would be very sad and alone.

Ashwatthama then told Duryodhana some good news. He said, "Only a few Pandavas are still alive, and only we three are left from your side.  I even secretly went into their camp at night and killed many of their soldiers, including their leader, Dhrishtadyumna!"

Hearing this, Duryodhana felt better. He said, "You did what even great warriors couldn't do.  I feel like a winner now!" Then, Duryodhana died peacefully.  The three warriors were very sad. They hugged him one last time before leaving.

Sanjaya, who was watching all of this, told the story to the king.  The king was very upset when he heard about his son’s death and sighed deeply.  The great battle was over, and many brave soldiers were gone.  The king was sad because his son started the whole war.
