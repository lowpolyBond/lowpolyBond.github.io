Once upon a time, during a big battle, a great warrior named Drona was fighting for the Kauravas.  He was super strong and brave! He was fighting so well that he was defeating many soldiers and even elephants!

The Pandavas, who were fighting against Drona, saw this.  King Yudhishthira told his best warriors, Arjuna and Dhrishtadyumna, "We need to stop Drona! Everyone surround him!"

Arjuna, Bhima, many princes, and lots of other brave soldiers all attacked Drona together.  They were strong and fought bravely.

But Drona was incredibly powerful! He fought like a storm, destroying many Pandava soldiers. His fast, red horses ran all over the battlefield. The Pandava soldiers were scared and some ran away, others stood and fought.  The noise was huge!  The whole sky and earth seemed to shake from all the shouting and fighting.

Drona was so strong, he shot so many arrows that the battlefield was filled with them. It was hard to see anything but his arrows flying everywhere! He was like a whirlwind of destruction.  He even made the ground muddy with blood!

Many brave warriors tried to stop Drona:  Bhima, Arjuna, and many others fought him fiercely, showering him with arrows. But Drona kept fighting, even though he was old.  He was like a fearless lion!

Finally, after defeating many many soldiers, even stronger than the number in many armies, Drona was defeated by Dhrishtadyumna.  Everyone was shocked! When Drona died, a huge sound went through the air—a sad cry from everyone who heard about it. The gods and even Drona’s friends watched from the sky.  

The Pandavas had won the battle, and they cheered loudly. The earth shook from their happy shouts!
