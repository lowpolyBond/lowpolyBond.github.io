Once upon a time, during a big battle, Nakula, a brave warrior, was fighting lots of enemies.  Sakuni, another warrior, saw Nakula and shouted, "Stop!"  They both wanted to win, so they started shooting arrows at each other!

They were so good at shooting that they looked like porcupines covered in quills. Their armor was all torn up, and they were bleeding, but they kept fighting! They looked like beautiful, sparkly trees covered in flowers.  Sakuni, Nakula's angry uncle, finally hit Nakula hard in the chest.  Nakula fell down, but he wasn't out for long.

He stood back up and shot sixty arrows, then a hundred more! He even broke Sakuni's bow and knocked his flag to the ground!  Sakuni was hurt badly and had to be carried away. Everyone cheered for Nakula!  He told his driver to take him to where another warrior, Drona, was fighting.


Then, another fight happened! Sikhandin, a strong warrior, fought Kripa, a wise teacher.  They shot lots of arrows back and forth. It was a very scary battle.  Kripa shot a special arrow at Sikhandin, but Sikhandin cut it in half with more arrows!  Then Kripa shot so many arrows at Sikhandin that Sikhandin had to be taken away, too.

That night, the battle kept going!  It was so dark, soldiers couldn't even tell who was on their side anymore!  Friends fought friends, brothers fought brothers.  Everything was a big mess of fighting, shouting, and arrows flying everywhere! The lamps on the chariots and elephants made the night look almost like day. It was a very scary and confusing battle!
