Once upon a time, a wise teacher named Vasishtha was talking to a king.  He explained two important ideas: Vidya (knowledge) and Avidya (ignorance).

He said, "Imagine a puzzle.  Avidya is like the jumbled-up pieces of the puzzle – it's the world around us, always changing and disappearing. Vidya is the finished puzzle – it’s seeing things as they truly are, peaceful and unchanging."

Vasishtha showed the king how to solve the puzzle.  He said,  Vidya is about understanding different things: our senses, our minds, and our inner self. It's like climbing a ladder.  Each step, from seeing to thinking to feeling to understanding the spirit within us, leads to greater knowledge.  At the very top of the ladder is the true, unchanging self, which is called Purusha.

Then Vasishtha talked about what is permanent (indestructible) and what isn't (destructible). He said, "Everything seems to change, to be born and die.  But there are two things that never truly die: our inner self (Purusha) and the source of everything (Prakriti)."  

He explained, "Even though things appear to disappear, the source of everything keeps making new things.  Our inner self, connected to that source, is also part of what is permanent.  It’s only when we forget our true self, that we get caught up in the changing world and suffer. This is like a fish that forgets it can survive outside of water, getting stuck in only one place."

The king listened carefully. Vasishtha continued, "When our inner self forgets its true nature, it gets mixed up with the changing world. It's like a fish trapped in a net. It feels pain and suffering.  But once it remembers who it really is, it breaks free."

Vasishtha described how this inner self can be freed. The king was happy to have learned so much about Vidya, Avidya, and how we all can find our true selves.  The teacher then explained that Sankhya (understanding the world) and Yoga (joining with the spirit) are two paths to reach this understanding.  Both paths lead to the same place: seeing the true, unchanging self within.
