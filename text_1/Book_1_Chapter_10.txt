Once upon a time, there was a wise man named Ruru.  He loved his wife very much. One day, a snake bit his wife!  Ruru was so angry, he made a promise: he would kill every snake he ever saw!

Then, he met a special snake, a Dundubha.  This snake said, "Wait!  Not all snakes are bad.  I'm a Dundubha. We are different from the snakes that bite people."

Ruru looked at the scared snake.  He saw the Dundubha was really afraid.  Ruru was a kind man, so he didn't kill it. Instead, he asked, "Who are you really?"

The Dundubha said, "I used to be a wise man named Sahasrapat.  A different wise man cursed me to be a snake!"  Then he asked Ruru, "Why did the other wise man curse me, and how long will I stay a snake?"

And that's the end of that part of the story!
