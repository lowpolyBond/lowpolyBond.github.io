Once upon a time, a hunter talked to a wise Brahmin.  The hunter said, "I know my job is cruel. I kill animals. But it's hard to escape what's meant to be.  This is bad karma from a past life.  But I try to be good."

He explained, "The gods and even my family eat the meat I sell.  Animals are food for everyone â€“ even other animals eat each other! Even a great king long ago, King Rantideva, fed lots of people meat every day.  Many religious ceremonies also use animal sacrifices."

The hunter continued, "Some people say it's okay to eat meat if you give some to the gods first.  Even great kings and wise people sometimes do bad things, even without meaning to.  Think about it:  farmers hurt insects when they plow their fields. Even walking can crush tiny bugs!  Everyone hurts animals, even without knowing it."

"So even though I'm a hunter," said the hunter,  "I try to be a good person.  I'm honest. I'm kind to the Brahmin. I don't brag. It's my job, and sticking to your job is good. Everyone has karma, good or bad, from their past lives. I try to do good things to balance the bad things."  The Brahmin listened carefully.  Even the best people sometimes make mistakes, he thought.  The hunter was trying his best.
