King Janaka was talking to a wise man. He said, "People say men and women are like two parts of something big.  A woman needs a man to have a baby. A man needs a woman, too! They work together.  The baby gets bones from the father and skin from the mother.  This is what the old books say, and they're always right."

King Janaka was worried. He said, "If everything is always connected like this, how can we ever be free?  Wise man, you can see everything clearly. Tell me, is there a way to be free?"

The wise man, Vasishtha, said, "King, you know what the books say, but you don't understand what they *really* mean. It's like remembering a story without understanding it. You're carrying a heavy bag, but it's empty!"

Vasishtha explained, "Our bodies are made of skin, flesh, blood, and bones.  Everything comes from something else.  A seed makes a plant, a body makes a body.  But the Great One, the one who made everything, doesn't have a body or a seed. He has no parts! He's not made of anything. He's like a light that shines without a lamp."

"Our bodies, which are made of things like skin and bones, are just a small part of the world.  The Great One is different. He's beyond everything we can see or touch. It's like seeing pretty flowers, which show us that the seasons are changing, even though we can't see the seasons themselves.  We know about the Great One because He's the light that makes everything shine."

Vasishtha continued, "The Great One isn't part of our bodies or the world. He's everywhere, always.  People only think He's part of things because they think they're one with their bodies. If they let go of their bodies, they'll see the Great One.  Only truly wise people understand this."

He said, "Think of the world like a puzzle. There are many pieces (25 pieces!), and each one is important. But the puzzle itself, the thing the pieces make, is even bigger and more important (the 26th piece).  Understanding all the puzzle pieces helps you see the whole picture, but the whole picture is even more amazing!"

King Janaka understood.  He learned that being free meant understanding that we're all part of something much bigger and more wonderful, and that the Great One is beyond everything we can see or touch.
