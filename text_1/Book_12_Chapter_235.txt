Once upon a time, a wise teacher named Vyasa told a story about how Brahmins (priests) should live. He said they should learn a lot from the holy Vedas books.  These books taught about gods, prayers, and how to be a good person.

Vyasa explained that Brahmins should be kind and never hurt anyone. They should earn their food honestly. They should learn from wise people and try to control their anger and bad feelings.  They should always try to do good things and be truthful.

Vyasa said that Brahmins should pray to the gods and perform special ceremonies. They should be patient and calm, never boastful or angry.  Being kind, honest, and practicing self-control helps them to be good people.

Vyasa then told a special story:  He said life is like a big, rushing river.  This river is Time!  It's full of troubles like anger and bad desires. These are like scary crocodiles! The river also has good things, like kindness and truthfulness, that are like safe islands.

The Vedas and prayers are like rafts that help people cross the river.  Only wise people, who are kind and learn a lot, can safely cross the river of time and reach a good place.  People who are not wise get swept away!

Vyasa said that wise Brahmins learn to control their desires and anger.  They understand the difference between right and wrong and always try to do what is good.  If they do this, they will be happy and avoid many problems.   They will successfully navigate the river of time.  If they don't learn to be wise, they will keep getting reborn and dying again and again, never getting to where they need to be.
