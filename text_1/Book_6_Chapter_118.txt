Once upon a time, in a great battle, a brave warrior named Sikhandin fought the mighty Bhishma.  Sikhandin shot many arrows at Bhishma's chest. Bhishma was angry, but he couldn't fight back!  He remembered something important about Sikhandin, and because of that, he didn't attack.

Arjuna, another brave warrior, told Sikhandin, "Keep fighting!  You're the only one who can beat Bhishma!"  So Sikhandin kept attacking, but Bhishma was still very strong.  He fought back, and many soldiers died.

Bhishma's son, Dussasana, was also very brave. He fought all the Pandava warriors, even Arjuna!  He was so strong that many soldiers fell.  Only Arjuna, with his friend Krishna driving his chariot, could stand up to Dussasana.

Arjuna fought Dussasana bravely and defeated him. Then he turned back to Bhishma.  Sikhandin shot more arrows at Bhishma, but Bhishma just laughed!  He was so strong, the arrows barely hurt him.

Duryodhana, another Kaurava prince, told his soldiers to attack Arjuna.  He said, "Bhishma will protect us!"  Many soldiers from different lands attacked Arjuna, but Arjuna was too strong.  He used magical weapons and defeated them all.  The battlefield was filled with dead soldiers and broken chariots.  It looked terrible!

Arjuna then attacked more of Duryodhana's soldiers, defeating many more. The battlefield was filled with dead soldiers and broken war machines. It was a very sad and bloody sight, with many dead animals and birds picking at the fallen bodies.  It was a terrible mess.


Finally, Bhishma tried to attack Arjuna with a powerful weapon. But Sikhandin quickly jumped in front of Arjuna, and Bhishma stopped.  Arjuna kept fighting, and the battle raged on.
