Once upon a time, after a long story, Nakula, a very brave warrior, asked his grandfather, Bhishma, a question.  Nakula loved swords. He said, "Grandfather, bows and arrows are great weapons, but swords are even better! If a bow breaks, or a horse gets hurt, a swordsman can still fight.  One strong swordsman can even fight many archers!  Which weapon is really the best? How were swords made, and who was the first person to teach people how to use them?"

Bhishma, who knew everything about bows and arrows, smiled. He said, "Nakula, I'll tell you a very old story.  A long, long time ago, the world was just water, dark and quiet.  Then, the Great Creator appeared! He made the sun, the moon, the stars, the earth, and everything else. He had sons who were powerful sages. These sages had daughters, and from them came all the animals, birds, and people.

"But some mean creatures called Danavas didn't follow the rules. They were bad and fought against the good gods. So, the Great Creator made a special weapon to help the good guys win. It was a shining, sharp sword, as bright as the moon!  He gave it to Lord Rudra, a powerful god.

Rudra, strong and tall, fought the Danavas. He swung his sword, and the Danavas ran and hid!  He was so fast, it looked like a thousand Rudras were fighting at once! He defeated the Danavas and brought peace back to the world.

Afterward, the sword was passed from god to god, from sage to king, for many, many years.  It traveled through history, from one great hero to the next.  Finally, it came to you and your brothers!  The sword has many names, and if you know them, you'll always win! The sword is the best weapon, but bows and arrows are also important."

Bhishma finished his story. He said, "Nakula, knowing this story will bring you great honor now and happiness forever!"
