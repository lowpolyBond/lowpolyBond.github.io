Once upon a time, during a big battle, a strong Rakshasa named Alamvusha was fighting bravely.  He was very fast and scary!  But Ghatotkacha, a super strong son of a giant, saw him.

Ghatotkacha zoomed towards Alamvusha and they started a huge fight!  It was like two giant lions fighting. They both used magic tricks, making fake copies of themselves to confuse each other.  It was amazing!  They threw lots of arrows at each other.  It was a really close battle!

Alamvusha was really good at magic, so he made lots of fake copies of Ghatotkacha to trick him. But Ghatotkacha was even better! He destroyed all of Alamvusha's tricks!

The Pandavas, Ghatotkachaâ€™s friends, saw Alamvusha was too strong.  They all jumped in to help! They surrounded Alamvusha like a net, shooting lots of arrows.  Alamvusha used his magic to get free, like an elephant escaping a fire!

He shot arrows back at the Pandavas:  twenty-five at Ghatotkacha's dad, Bhima; five at Bhima's son; three at Yudhishthira; seven at Sahadeva; and lots and lots more at the others! Then everyone fired even more arrows.  The ground shook with the noise and the force of the arrows!

Finally, Ghatotkacha got really angry. He zoomed over to Alamvusha, grabbed him like a bird grabbing a snake, and smashed him to pieces on the ground!

Alamvusha was broken like a smashed pot. The Pandavas were so happy! They cheered and shouted.  Even the people watching were amazed. Ghatotkacha was praised for being so strong and brave! The Pandavas blew their horns to celebrate their victory. The Kauravas shouted back, but the Pandavas were happy because they had won that part of the big fight.
