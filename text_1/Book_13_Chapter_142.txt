Once upon a time, Uma asked Lord Shiva, also called Sankara or Mahadeva, about forest hermits.  "They live in amazing places," she said, "near rivers and hills, in forests full of yummy fruits and roots.  They are very focused and follow strict rules. Tell me about their lives!"

Shiva explained, "These hermits are very strong and self-reliant. They wake up early and bathe three times a day. They pray to the gods and offer gifts to the fire. They eat simple food like fruits, roots, and grains. They practice special breathing exercises called Yoga to become peaceful and strong. They sit in a special way called Virasana.  They live in places that are hard to reach, places only brave people would go!"

He continued, "Sometimes they sit in the sun surrounded by four fires!  They sleep on bare rocks or the ground.  They are tough; they might eat only moss or drink only water.  They use just two stones or even their teeth to grind their food. They don’t keep fancy dishes or pots."  Some wear only rags or animal skins.  They live a simple life following the rules of their religion, always helping others.

Uma then asked about hermits who had families.  Shiva said, "Some hermits have wives and live at home.  They still bathe three times a day, pray, and offer gifts to the fire. They practice Yoga, are kind, and follow the rules of their religion. They only spend time with their wives at the right times."

He added, "Being kind and honest is the most important thing.  If you help everyone and don’t hurt anyone, you will be good. Being truly sincere and kind to all living things is like bathing in holy water!"

Uma asked more questions. "What about hermits who do very hard things to become holy?  What about rich kings and poor people?  What can they do?"

Shiva answered, "If you fast, don't hurt anyone, and always tell the truth, you’ll go to Heaven and have fun with the magical Gandharvas!  If you live like a deer, only eating what it leaves behind, you'll go to Indra's palace! If you eat only moss and leaves and are brave in the cold, you'll go to a very high place in Heaven!  If you only eat air, water, fruits, or roots, you'll live with the Yakshas and Apsaras.  If you do very hard things for many years, you might even become a king!"

He went on to explain different ways people could be good, describing how different actions lead to different rewards in heaven.  The most important thing was to be strong, kind, and true to oneself, no matter what one chose to do.
