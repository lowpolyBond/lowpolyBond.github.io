Once upon a time, a little bird and his wife lived happily together.  They played in the valleys, splashed in the river, and flew high in the sky!  One day, a hunter came and sadly, he hurt the little bird. He flew away and died.

The little bird's wife was very, very sad. She cried and cried.  "My dear husband," she sobbed, "You were always so kind to me. We had such fun together!  My life is nothing without you.  A wife needs her husband; he is her protector, her best friend, and her happiness."

She missed him so much that she felt she couldn't live without him.  She decided to join him.  She flew to a big fire and jumped in!

Suddenly, she was in heaven! She saw her husband! He was beautiful, wearing sparkly clothes and riding a magical chariot.  He was surrounded by angels. They were all happy to see him. Then, her husband reached down, and she flew up into the chariot beside him.  They were together again, flying happily through the sky, forever!
