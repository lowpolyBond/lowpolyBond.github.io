Once upon a time, there was a very strong Salmali tree.  A wise man named Narada saw the tree and was surprised.  He said, "Salmali, the wind is super strong! It can break anything – trees, mountains, even houses! Yet, you're still standing tall.  The wind must be protecting you!"

Salmali laughed. "Oh, Narada," she said, "the wind is not my friend.  I am much stronger!  The wind is only one-eighteenth as strong as me. When the wind gets angry and tries to break me, I stop it! I'm the one who’s stronger."

Narada was shocked.  "Salmali," he said, "that's not true! The wind is the strongest of all! Even the gods are afraid of it!  It gives life to everything. When the wind is good, everything is good.  When it's bad, bad things happen.  You’re wrong to be so boastful. You should respect the wind."

Narada continued, "Other trees, much stronger than you, know the wind's power and show respect.  They don't brag like you.  Because you are so disrespectful, I will tell the wind god what you said!"

Salmali, the strong but boastful tree, didn't listen.  Narada, very upset, promised to tell the wind god all about Salmali's bragging.
