Once upon a time, in the land of ancient India, two wise men, Ashtaka and Yayati, talked about how people should live good lives.  They talked about four ways of life:

* **Students:** Young people who lived with their teachers and learned.  They had to be respectful, listen carefully, and work hard.  They needed to get up early, go to bed late, and always be polite.

* **Householders:** Grown-ups who had families and jobs. They needed to work hard honestly, share their things, be kind to guests, and always share what they have.

* **Forest Dwellers:** People who lived in the forest, far from towns. They needed to be kind to animals, not do bad things, and give away some of what they had.

* **Holy Men:**  People who gave up everything to be peaceful and spiritual. They didn't work for money, they were very kind and controlled their feelings. They didn't live in houses, and they traveled far.

Ashtaka asked Yayati, "What about holy men? Are there different kinds?"

Yayati said, "Yes! Some live near towns but still live simply like holy men. Others live in towns but act like holy men anyway! They are humble and don't boast about themselves. They only take what they need, and are always happy. A truly holy man controls his feelings, is kind to everyone, and only wants to be good."

Yayati explained that the best holy men were like this: they were very peaceful,  didn’t worry about good or bad things happening to them, and focused only on being good and spiritual. They were happy and became one with the whole world.  They even ate like little babies – without thinking about it – because they didn't worry about themselves!


This is how they could be good and happy and go to a wonderful place after they died.
