Once upon a time, during a great battle, two brave warriors, Satyaki and Bhurisravas, fought fiercely.  They each shot nine arrows at each other!  Then, Duryodhana and his brothers surrounded Satyaki.  But the Pandavas quickly protected him.

Bhima, a super strong Pandava, fought Duryodhana's sons. Nandaka, one of Duryodhana's sons, shot many arrows at Bhima. Duryodhana himself also shot arrows at Bhima.

Bhima told his charioteer, Visoka, "These warriors are very angry! I will defeat them all!"  Bhima fought bravely, shooting arrows at Duryodhana and Nandaka.  Duryodhana, though, broke Bhima's bow!

Bhima got a new bow and broke *Duryodhana's* bow!  But Duryodhana got another bow and hit Bhima hard. Bhima was hurt and fainted!

The other Pandavas were angry.  They showered arrows on Duryodhana's sons.  Bhima woke up and fought back, defeating many of Duryodhana's brothers.  He even defeated fourteen of them all at once! They all fought with many arrows flying everywhere!

Then, Bhima fought Bhagadatta, who was riding a big elephant.  Bhagadatta shot so many arrows that he almost hid Bhima!  But the Pandavas protected Bhima and fought back, hurting Bhagadatta's elephant.  Bhagadatta then hit Bhima, and Bhima fainted again.

Ghatotkacha, a powerful warrior, saw Bhima was hurt. He magically appeared, riding a giant elephant with three other huge elephants! They attacked Bhagadatta's elephant.  The elephant screamed loudly!

Bhishma, the wise leader, saw the danger and asked everyone to rescue Bhagadatta.  But then Bhishma saw how powerful Ghatotkacha was, and how tired everyone was.  So, he told everyone to go back to camp.

The Pandavas cheered because they won the battle.  But Duryodhana was sad because many of his brothers had died. He spent the night thinking about his losses.
