Once upon a time, King Janamejaya, a brave king from the Pandava family, decided to hold a special sacrifice.  This sacrifice was to punish all the snakes!  It was a very scary time for snakes everywhere.

A wise man named Saunaka asked, "Who were all the important priests at this scary snake sacrifice?"

Another wise man, Sauti, answered, "Many great priests helped the king. Chandabhargava was the main priest. Kautsa chanted beautiful songs.  Jaimini, Sarngarva, Pingala, Vyasa, and many, many other wise men were there too!  They all knew a lot about the special rituals."

When the sacrifice started, it was terrible!  Lots and lots of snakes fell into the fire.  The smell was awful, and the snakes cried out.  It was a very sad and scary sight.

One very important snake, Takshaka, was scared! He went to Indra, the king of the gods, for help. Indra said, "Don't worry, Takshaka, you're safe!"

But another snake, Vasuki, the king of all snakes, was very, very sad.  Many of his family were dying.  He was so worried he felt like he would fall down and die too.

Vasuki told his sister, "We need help!  Our son, Astika, is very wise. He can stop this terrible sacrifice.  He's very good at the special rituals!"

So Vasuki's sister went to find her son, Astika, to save the snakes!  What will Astika do?
