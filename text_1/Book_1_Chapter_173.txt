Once upon a time, a powerful king named Samvarana was hunting in the forest.  His horse got tired and died.  Samvarana had to walk.

Then, he saw the most beautiful girl he had ever seen!  She was so beautiful, he thought she might be a goddess!  She was like a shining golden statue.  He had never seen anyone so lovely.

The king was completely smitten. He asked her, "Who are you? Why are you alone in the woods? You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen!"

But the beautiful girl didn't answer.  She disappeared like magic!  The king was very sad. He searched everywhere for her, but she was gone.


Much later, a magical being called a Gandharva told Arjuna, a great warrior, this story. The Gandharva said that the beautiful girl was Tapati, the daughter of the sun god.  The king was her husband-to-be, but she vanished!  This is why the Gandharva called Arjuna "Tapatya," meaning connected to Tapati. The Gandharva also mentioned that the Kauravas (Arjuna's relatives) were descended from Tapati.  The story of the beautiful girl taught that even powerful kings can be overcome by love and beauty.
