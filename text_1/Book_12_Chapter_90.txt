Long ago, a wise teacher named Utathya told King Mandhatri a very important story.  Bhishma, a great warrior, later told this same story to another king named Yudhishthira.  Let's hear what Utathya said!

Utathya said, "Being a king isn't about being bossy.  It's about being fair and kind. A king is like a protector of everyone.  If a king is good and fair, he's like a god! But if he's mean and unfair, bad things happen.  Everything good depends on being fair.  And fairness depends on the king!"

He explained, "A truly good king is kind and gentle. If a king doesn't stop bad things, the good spirits leave, and people don't respect him.  When people do what's right, good things happen.  But when bad things aren't stopped, everything gets messed up. People can't even say, 'This is mine!'  They lose their homes, their animals, even their families!  Temples are empty, and nobody is kind to visitors.  Even smart people stop studying and praying.  Everyone gets scared and confused, like they've been hurt."

Utathya said, "Wise people made kings to be fair and good on Earth.  A good king is called 'Rajan', but a bad king is called 'Vrishala'.  Being good is like a strong plant that helps everyone grow. If it's not protected, everyone suffers.  Being good also helps people keep what they own. Wise people say being good stops bad things from happening."

"Being good comes from the gods.  That's why it's important to be nice to wise teachers and priests. If you’re not kind to them, you’ll lose your friends and make enemies.  A long time ago, a proud king wasn't kind, and the good luck spirit got angry and left him!  She went to a better king. The first king was very sad.  Pride and being unfair can ruin anyone, even kings and gods!"

Utathya warned Mandhatri, "Don't be friends with proud, mean, or silly people.  Stay away from angry people you’ve punished, and from dangerous places. Don't be greedy or boastful.  Don't be with women who aren't your wife. If a king doesn't stop bad things, many bad things happen:  babies born sick, families fighting, and the world gets scary.  If a king isn't careful, bad weather happens, and everyone suffers.  If the king doesn't protect his people, they will all be hurt, and then the king will be hurt too."

Utathya finished by saying, "If the king isn’t good and fair, everything falls apart.  So be a good king, Mandhatri!"
