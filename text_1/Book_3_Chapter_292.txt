Once upon a time, a princess named Savitri went on a long trip. She visited many holy places.  When she returned, her father, King Aswapati, was talking with a wise man named Narada.  Narada asked why Savitri wasn't married yet.

King Aswapati said, "Savitri has been looking for a husband. She has chosen one!"

Savitri told everyone about Satyavan, a prince.  Satyavan's father had lost his kingdom because he was blind.  They lived in the forest.  Savitri loved Satyavan and wanted to marry him.

Narada was worried. He said, "Satyavan is a wonderful person, but he will die within a year."

King Aswapati was upset. He told Savitri to choose someone else.  But Savitri said, "I only get one chance to choose a husband. I love Satyavan, even if he doesn't live long.  My choice is final!"

Narada was amazed by Savitri's love and strong will. He agreed that she should marry Satyavan.  King Aswapati was happy his daughter was so brave and true.  He started planning a wonderful wedding for Savitri and Satyavan.  And Narada flew up to the sky and went home.
