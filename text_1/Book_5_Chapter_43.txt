King Dhritarashtra asked a wise man, Sanat-sujata, about silence (mauna).  He wanted to know what kind of silence helped people become peaceful and free.

Sanat-sujata said, "The greatest silence is like the quiet power of the Supreme Soul.  It's the source of all sounds, even the 'Om' sound."

Dhritarashtra then asked if people who knew the holy books (Vedas) still did bad things.

Sanat-sujata answered, "Knowing the Vedas doesn't make you good if you don't control your feelings.  The Vedas leave people who are bad and sneaky."

Dhritarashtra was confused. He thought the Vedas always made people good.

Sanat-sujata explained, "The world came from the Supreme Soul. The Vedas talk about this Soul.  Being good and doing good things helps us get closer to that Soul.  If you're good, you'll be happy. If you only care about things you want, you'll keep coming back to life again and again."

Dhritarashtra wondered why some people's good actions worked and some didn't.

Sanat-sujata said, "Good actions without bad feelings like pride work best. Actions done to show off don't work as well."

Dhritarashtra then asked about bad feelings that ruin good actions.

Sanat-sujata listed many: anger, greed, being mean, and more. He also talked about good qualities like being kind and truthful.  He explained that true self-control and letting go of things we want are also important. He explained different ways of letting go of things we want.

Dhritarashtra asked about different ideas about the Supreme Soul. Some people believed in many gods, others in one.

Sanat-sujata said, "There is only one true Supreme Soul, which is Truth. People think of many gods because they don't understand this Truth.  To find the Truth, you need to be truthful and good. You can do this through prayer, good actions, or quiet thought."

Sanat-sujata said that truly knowing the Vedas meant understanding the Supreme Soul, not just reading the words. It's not about reading a lot, it's about living truthfully.

Sanat-sujata explained that true wisdom comes from understanding ourselves and the world, not just from our senses. He said the Supreme Soul can only truly be seen by someone who is very calm and focused.  He urged Dhritarashtra to find this within himself.  Only then would he truly be wise and free.
