King Yudhishthira asked Bhishma, "Tell me more about the good things that happen when you give away cows! I can never hear enough of your stories!"

Bhishma said, "I'll tell you a story about a wise man named Uddalaki and his son, Nachiketa.  Uddalaki told Nachiketa, "Go get me firewood, grass, flowers, water, and vegetables from the river."

Nachiketa went to the river, but the river had washed everything away!  He came back sadly and said, "Everything is gone!" Uddalaki was angry and hungry. He shouted, "May you meet Yama, the god of death, today!"

Suddenly, Nachiketa fell down and died! Uddalaki was very, very sad. He cried and cried.  Then, a miracle! Nachiketa came back to life!  He was weak, but alive.

Uddalaki asked, "Nachiketa, where were you? You look amazing!"

Nachiketa said, "I went to Yama's beautiful palace! It shone like gold! Yama welcomed me and asked, 'What do you want?' I said, 'I want to see the wonderful places good people go after they die.'"

Yama showed Nachiketa amazing places.  There were palaces made of gold and silver, rivers of milk and honey, and trees that granted wishes!

Nachiketa asked Yama, "Who gets to live in these amazing places?"

Yama said, "People who give away cows get to live here. But it's not just about giving any cow.  You must give a healthy cow to a good person, at the right time, and with proper ceremonies. A good person to give a cow to is someone who studies holy books, is kind, and is poor. You should also give a cow that gives lots of milk and has a good calf.  Give away the cow after fasting for three days and eating only water, and then eat only milk for three days after you give it away."

Nachiketa continued, "Yama also told me that if you can't give a real cow, you can give a cow made of ghee (clarified butter), or sesame seeds, or even just water!  Each one brings special blessings. It's the act of giving that matters most!"

Nachiketa said, "Yama's curse was a blessing! It helped me learn about giving. Now I understand how giving brings great happiness, even after we die. The best way to be happy is to give what you can, especially cows, on the right day."  Yama told Nachiketa to always give generously and kindly to those who need it.  Giving cows is a very special act of kindness that brings good fortune.
