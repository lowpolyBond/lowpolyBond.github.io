Once upon a time, after a big, terrible war, the Pandava brothers – Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva – were very sad.  They had won, but many of their family and friends were dead.  They sat by a river, grieving.  Wise people like Narada and Vyasa came to comfort them.

Narada asked Yudhishthira, "You won the war! You should be happy! Why are you so sad?"

Yudhishthira sighed. "I'm very sad because of all the fighting and deaths.  But the worst part is... Karna, the great warrior who fought against us, was actually my older brother!"

Yudhishthira explained that their mother, Kunti, had kept a secret.  Karna was her son, but she had given him away a long time ago.  He grew up thinking he was someone else's son.  Neither Yudhishthira nor his brothers knew Karna was their brother until after the war.

"I killed my own brother!" cried Yudhishthira. "I feel terrible.  He was brave and strong. If we had been together, we could have won even faster.  And even when he was mean to us, I somehow felt like he was family."

Yudhishthira also told Narada about a time before the war when Kunti had tried to make Karna join their side. Karna refused, saying he couldn't betray his friend Duryodhana. He even promised to spare Yudhishthira's brothers if he could capture them, and he was so upset by all of this as well.

"Why did Karna's chariot get stuck in the mud during the battle?" Yudhishthira asked. "Why did all this happen?  Tell me everything, Narada. You know so much!"

Narada promised to explain everything to Yudhishthira, and help him understand why such sad things had happened.  He began to tell the story of Karna's life... and how fate had led to the tragic death of a brother at the hands of his brother.
