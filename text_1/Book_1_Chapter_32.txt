Once upon a time, in the magical world of the gods, Garuda, a giant, super-strong bird, flew to where the gods were guarding a special drink called Amrita.  The gods were scared of Garuda!  He was so strong!

Garuda fought a powerful god named Brahmana.  It was a quick fight, but Brahmana fell!  Then, Garuda flapped his huge wings, making a giant dust storm.  The dust was so thick, the gods couldn't see! They coughed and fainted!

Then, Indra, the king of the gods, asked the wind god, Vayu, to blow away the dust.  When the dust cleared, the gods attacked Garuda. Garuda roared like a scary storm cloud!  He fought bravely, using his sharp talons, beak, and wings.  He hurt many gods, and they all ran away in different directions!

Garuda also fought some strong Yakshas (magical beings). He beat them all easily!

Finally, Garuda reached the Amrita.  It was surrounded by huge, scary flames!  To put out the fire, Garuda opened ninety times ninety mouths â€“ that's a lot of mouths!  He drank water from many rivers, and then sprayed the water onto the fire, putting it out.  Then, he made himself tiny so he could get to the Amrita!


And that's how Garuda, the brave bird, almost got the magical Amrita!
