Once upon a time, three royal babies were born.  This made the Kuru kingdom very happy!  The land became rich and fertile.  The crops grew big and tasty.  It rained at just the right time, and trees were full of delicious fruit and pretty flowers.

Animals were happy. Birds sang sweetly.  Flowers smelled wonderful, and the fruits were extra sweet.  Cities were full of busy people â€“ merchants, artists, and craftspeople.  Everyone was brave, kind, and smart.  There were no bad people or thieves.  It was like a magical, golden time!

People were friendly and helpful. They loved each other.  They played games and celebrated together. The capital city, Hastinapura, was huge and beautiful, like a magical city in the sky! People played by the rivers and in lovely forests.  Everywhere, people were happy and rich.  There were no poor people or sad widows.

King Bhishma ruled wisely and fairly.  He helped everyone. He made sure everyone was happy and treated each other kindly. People from other kingdoms even moved to the Kuru kingdom because it was so wonderful!  Everyone shared their food and helped each other.

Three brothers, Dhritarashtra, Pandu, and Vidura, grew up together.  Bhishma raised them like his own sons. They learned to fight, ride horses, and shoot arrows. They learned about being good people. They also learned a lot from books and teachers.  Pandu was the best archer. Dhritarashtra was the strongest.  Vidura was the wisest and kindest of all.

Because Dhritarashtra was blind, and Vidura wasn't born to a royal mother, Pandu became king. Everyone agreed that Vidura was the best and kindest person in the whole land.  People said the Kuru kingdom was the best kingdom, Vidura the best man, and Hastinapura the best city.  And so, the kingdom lived in peace and happiness, for a time...
