Once upon a time, a wise man named Vyasa told a story about how people should live their lives. He said that after learning and growing up, people should settle down and start families.  He talked about different ways to manage a home and family.

Some people saved enough food for three whole years!  Others saved enough for just one year.  Some only saved enough for each day.  And some were like pigeons, only finding enough food for right then.  Saving more food was better, according to the wise man.

Households who saved a lot of food could do lots of good things:  worship, teach others, learn themselves, give gifts, and receive gifts.  Those who saved less could still do some of these good things.

Vyasa said it was very important to share food. Never cook only for yourself.  Only kill animals for special ceremonies, and only cut down trees according to special rules.  Everyone and everything deserves respect.

He said good housekeepers should not sleep too much. They should eat only twice a day. And they should always treat their guests kindly, especially those who were wise and kind.  They should even share food with everyone, even people who weren’t very nice.

Vyasa explained that a good housekeeper should be happy with their family. They should be kind, and not argue with anyone – not their family, friends, or even grumpy neighbours!  Being peaceful brought good things.

He said being respectful to your teacher, parents, and guests brought good luck. Being kind to everyone brought even more good things!  A good housekeeper’s family was like their own body:  their wife, children, and servants were all important.  They should treat everyone with love.

Vyasa said that being a good housekeeper was very important. It was better than just studying, and even better than living in the woods all alone.  Being a good, kind housekeeper made life better for your family, for your ancestors, and for your children's children for many years to come.  Being a kind and good housekeeper meant going to a wonderful, happy place after you die.  It was a great reward for living a good life!  And after that, he explained how people could live even better lives still.
