Pradyumna, a brave warrior, was fighting a giant named Salwa.  Salwa hurt Pradyumna with his arrows, and Pradyumna fainted!  His friends, the Vrishnis, were very sad.  The enemy was happy.

Pradyumna's chariot driver, Daruka's son, quickly took him away from the battle.  Before they went far, Pradyumna woke up.  He was angry!

"What are you doing?" Pradyumna asked his driver. "Why are we leaving the battle?  Vrishni warriors never run away!"

The driver explained, "Pradyumna, Salwa is too strong! I was protecting you because you were hurt."

Pradyumna said, "No! We must go back!  What will my family and friends think? They'll call me a coward!  That's worse than death! It's not right to leave a battle, even if I'm hurt. I promised to fight Salwa, and I will!"

He reminded his driver about all the brave Vrishni warriors who would be ashamed of him. He thought about his brothers, his friends, and even what his wife would say!  He didn't want anyone to think he was a scaredy-cat.

Pradyumna told his driver to turn the chariot around and go back to the battle. He said he would rather die fighting bravely than live as a coward. The driver, knowing his warrior was right, turned the chariot and headed back to the fight.
