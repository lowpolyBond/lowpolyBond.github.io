Once upon a time, there lived a beautiful princess named Kunti.  She was kind and smart, but no king wanted to marry her.  Her father, King Kuntibhoja, was worried.

He invited many kings to a big party.  He told Kunti she could choose her own husband.  Kunti looked around at all the kings.  Then she saw Pandu.

Pandu was a strong and handsome prince.  He was brave and kind, like a lion!  Kunti loved him instantly.  She shyly put a flower garland around his neck, choosing him to be her husband.

The other kings were sad, but they went home.  Kunti and Pandu got married.  Kunti's father gave them lots of gifts.  Pandu and Kunti, happy and in love, rode home with their friends and family, everyone celebrating their wedding.  They lived happily in Pandu's beautiful palace.
