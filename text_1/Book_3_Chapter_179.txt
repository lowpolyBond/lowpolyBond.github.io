Once upon a time, in the great land of Bharatavarsha, the mighty Pandava brothers were on a journey.  Bhima, the strongest brother, was suddenly caught by a giant snake!  It was huge, like a mountain!

Yudhishthira, the eldest brother, was very worried.  "Bhima!" he cried. "What happened? Who is this enormous snake?"

Bhima explained, "Brother, this is Nahusha, a powerful king who's now a snake! He wants to eat me!"

Yudhishthira begged the snake, "Please, spare my brother! We'll give you other food."

But the snake refused.  "I've waited a long time for a meal like this.  I won't let him go.  And if you stay, you'll be my next meal!"

Yudhishthira pleaded, "Please tell me why you're doing this!  I'm Yudhishthira, and I want to understand."

The snake finally spoke.  "Long ago, I was King Nahusha. I was very powerful, but I was also very proud. I was unkind to wise people, and for that, I was punished by a great sage named Agastya. Now I'm a snake, and I must eat your brother."

But then the snake said, "If you can answer my questions, I'll let Bhima go.  Tell me: Who is a true Brahmin, and what is the most important thing to know?"

Yudhishthira thought carefully. "A Brahmin," he said, "is someone who is honest, kind, forgiving, and always does what is right. The most important thing to know is the great truth of the universe – the ultimate reality that is beyond all happiness and sorrow."

The snake shook his head. "Those good qualities, you find them even in the simplest of people. And I don't believe there's anything without happiness or sorrow."

Yudhishthira explained, "Being a Brahmin isn't just about birth; it's about how you live.  A person born into a Brahmin family might not be a true Brahmin if they don't act like one.  And it's the same for everyone.  What really matters is being a good person."

The snake listened carefully.  Yudhishthira continued, "It’s like hot and cold.  You can't have both at the same time. But happiness and sorrow are different; they are part of life."


The snake was impressed. "You're right, Yudhishthira. You understand.  Because you know the truth, I will set your brother free!" And so, Bhima was released, and the giant snake slithered away.
