Once upon a time, the great god Indra talked to Narayana.  They planned a big party!  All the gods from heaven were coming down to Earth. Indra told everyone in heaven what to do. Then, he went back to Narayana.  The gods came to Earth one by one.

They came to fight bad guys called Asuras, Rakshasas, and Gandharvas.  These bad guys were mean and scary! But the gods were super strong, even as babies! They beat all the bad guys.

A king named Janamejaya wanted to hear all about how the gods, and even the bad guys, were born.  Vaisampayana, a wise storyteller, agreed.

He explained that a god named Brahman had six sons.  One son, Kasyapa, had lots of children!  One of Kasyapa's wives, Aditi, had twelve super strong sons, called the Adityas.  They were the bosses of the universe!

Another wife, Diti, had a son named Hiranyakasipu. He had sons, too, including Prahlada who was very good.  Yet another wife, Danu, had forty sons! They were all strong Asuras.

Sinhika had a son named Rahu, who chased the sun and the moon.  Other wives, like Kala, Danayu, and Krodha, also had many children, some good, some bad!  Sukra was a priest for the Asuras.

Vinata had sons like Garuda, a powerful bird.  Kadru had many snake children, including Vasuki. Muni had many god and Gandharva children. Pradha had many beautiful Apsaras (dancing girls) and Gandharvas (musicians). Kapila had lots of Brahmins (priests) and cows.

Vaisampayana told Janamejaya about all the gods, the good and bad guys, the snakes, the birds, and even the dancing girls.  He said this story was special and if you listen carefully, good things will happen to you!  It will bring you good luck and happiness.
