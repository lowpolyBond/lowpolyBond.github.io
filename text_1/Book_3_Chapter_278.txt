Once upon a time, Rama was very sad.  His wife, Sita, had been taken away!  He walked until he reached a beautiful lake filled with lotus flowers. The gentle breeze made him think even more about Sita. He started to cry.

His brother, Lakshmana, saw him and said, "Rama, don't be sad! We know where Sita is. Let's be brave and find her! Let's go see Sugriva, the monkey king, he might help us!"

Rama felt better. He and Lakshmana washed in the lake and prayed. Then they went to find Sugriva.  They saw some monkeys on a mountain.  A big, strong monkey named Hanuman came to greet them.

Rama and Sugriva became friends. Sugriva showed Rama a piece of Sita's cloth.  Rama promised to help Sugriva become king again if he helped rescue Sita.

Sugriva's brother, Vali, was a mean king. Sugriva roared loudly, challenging Vali to a fight.  Vali's wife, Tara, warned him that Sugriva had powerful friends: Rama and Lakshmana! But Vali was jealous and didn't listen.

Vali and Sugriva fought!  They were strong and fought hard.  Hanuman put a flower garland on Sugriva. Rama saw the garland and knew it was Sugriva.  He shot an arrow, and Vali was hurt badly.  He fell down and died. Sugriva became king. Rama and Lakshmana stayed with Sugriva for a while.

Meanwhile, Sita was very sad.  Ravana had taken her to his city, Lanka. He kept her in a beautiful garden but guarded her with scary monster women! These women were mean and ugly, with extra eyes, legs, or even arms! They wanted to hurt Sita.

Sita was very brave. She refused to give up hope, even though she missed Rama very much. She said she would rather die than be with anyone else.

One kind monster woman, Trijata, secretly told Sita good news.  She said Rama was looking for her and had made friends with Sugriva. Trijata told Sita that a magic spell protected her from Ravana, and Rama would soon be there to save her. She even told Sita about a dream she had that showed Ravana would be defeated. Sita felt a little bit happier. Then the mean monster women came back, but Sita and Trijata were still together.
