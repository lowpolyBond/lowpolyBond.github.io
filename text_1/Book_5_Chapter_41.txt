King Dhritarashtra was talking to his wise brother, Vidura.  "Vidura," said the King, "tell me anything else you think I should know.  I love listening to you!"

Vidura said, "King, a very wise and old man named Sanat-sujata knows all the answers to your questions. He's lived a long life and says there's no such thing as death!"

Dhritarashtra said, "You know what Sanat-sujata would say? Tell me!"

Vidura said, "I'm not as wise as he is.  He's a very holy man, and only someone like him should answer your questions."

Dhritarashtra asked, "Then how can I meet this wise man?"

Vidura thought hard about the wise man.  Suddenly, *poof*!  The wise man appeared! Vidura welcomed him properly.  After the wise man rested, Vidura said, "Sir, King Dhritarashtra has some worries.  He's sad and confused about many things: happiness and sadness, getting old, getting sick, even death! Can you help him understand?"
