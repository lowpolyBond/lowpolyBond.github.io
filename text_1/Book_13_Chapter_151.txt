Once upon a time, a kind prince named Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandpa, who should we respect the most? How should we treat everyone?"

Bhishma smiled.  "Yudhishthira," he said, "Brahmanas, or wise teachers, are the most important.  Never disrespect them!  They are like your own sons. They are so wise they help keep the world going.  Think of them as the best roads to being good. They are happy even without lots of things. They are always kind and they follow many good rules.  Everyone goes to them for help. They make all the rules for the world. They are famous for their hard work and prayers. They speak with great power. They are very observant and understand everything. They always want to do what is right. They are the path we should all follow; they guide us. They are like strong oxen that carry heavy burdens without getting tired. They take care of everyoneâ€”gods, guests, and the poor.  They always get the first food. Even the food they eat protects the world from danger. They are like a safe island for everyone. They are the eyes of the world, and they know everything. They are learned and wise and see good and bad as the same; rich clothes and rags are the same to them. They are very strong. Sometimes they even go without food for many days. They study hard and control their feelings. They can even make new worlds if they get angry!

Even if a Brahmana does something wrong, you should still respect them. They are always very important.  A fire is still holy even if it burns in a graveyard.  Good butter is still good whether it's on an altar or in a cupboard.  So, always honor Brahmanas, young or old, wise or not. They are like gods!"
