Long ago, there was a king named Gaya.  He was very, very good. For one hundred whole years, he only ate the leftover food from his special fire ceremonies.  

A magical fire god, Agni, was so happy with Gaya's kindness and devotion that he offered Gaya a wish!

Gaya wished for many things. He wished to be really smart and learn all about the holy books. He wished to be rich and help others. He wished to have a big family and always be kind and fair.

Agni said, "So be it!"  And poof! Gaya had everything he wished for. He became a strong king and won all his battles.

For a hundred years, Gaya held amazing ceremonies. He gave away tons of gifts!  He gave cows, horses, and gold to everyone. He even made a giant golden altar for his ceremonies. It was HUGE!  Think of the biggest sandbox you've ever seen, but made of gold and jewels!  He gave that away too!

He gave so much food, clothes, and treasure, that mountains of food and rivers of drinks were left over! Animals, people, and even gods were amazed by his generosity.  Everyone agreed, it was the best ceremony ever!

Because of his kindness and amazing ceremonies, people still remember Gaya today.  He was a very good king.

Narada, a wise storyteller, was telling this to someone who was sad about their son's death. Narada said, "Don't be sad!  Your son didn't do good things like King Gaya. Gaya was much better!"
