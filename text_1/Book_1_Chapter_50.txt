Once upon a time, King Parikshit was very tired and hungry. He'd been carrying a dead snake on his shoulders for a wise man, a Rishi named Utanka.  When he got home, Utanka's son, Sringin, heard about what happened. Sringin was strong and brave, but he was also very angry! He was furious that someone had been so mean to his father.

Sringin was so angry that he cursed the king! He said, "Because of my magic powers, Takshaka the snake will kill you in seven days!"  Utanka, Sringin's father, was a very good and wise man. He was sad his son had cursed the king, but he knew he couldn’t stop it. He sent a messenger to warn King Parikshit.

The messenger told the king about the curse. King Parikshit was scared, but he tried to protect himself.  On the seventh day, a very powerful holy man, Kasyapa, was coming to help the king. But Takshaka, the snake, saw him first!

Takshaka asked Kasyapa where he was going. Kasyapa said he was going to save the king from Takshaka's poison. Takshaka showed Kasyapa how powerful his poison was by turning a big tree to ash with one bite! But Kasyapa brought the tree back to life with his magic.

Takshaka offered Kasyapa lots and lots of treasure if he didn’t save the king. Kasyapa, wanting the treasure, went away.  So Takshaka bit King Parikshit, and the king died.

Later, King Parikshit's son, Janamejaya, became king. He was very sad and angry about his father’s death.  He learned that Takshaka had stopped Kasyapa from helping his father.  Janamejaya decided to take revenge on Takshaka and all snakes! He wanted to make sure no one would ever be hurt by a snake again.
