After the big war, Yudhishthira felt sad. He had lost many family members.  He wanted to know how to be a good king and do what's right. He asked a wise man for advice.

The wise man said, "Go talk to Bhishma. He's very old and wise. He knows all about being a good king and following the right path."

Bhishma was super smart! He had learned from the best teachers, even the gods! He knew everything about being good and fair.

But Yudhishthira felt bad. He said, "I tricked Bhishma during the war. How can I ask him for advice?"

Then Krishna, a very strong and kind hero, spoke up.  He said, "Don't worry, Yudhishthira.  Bhishma is wise and will help you. Everyone needs your guidance now."

Krishna, along with his friends and family, helped Yudhishthira feel better.  Everyone encouraged him to go see Bhishma.

Yudhishthira finally felt ready. He rode in a beautiful, white chariot pulled by sixteen strong white oxen. His brothers rode with him.  Krishna and other friends followed in their own chariots. The whole city was decorated to welcome him. People lined the streets, throwing flowers.  It was a grand parade!  Everyone was happy to see their king returning. Yudhishthira, surrounded by his family and friends, finally entered his city.
