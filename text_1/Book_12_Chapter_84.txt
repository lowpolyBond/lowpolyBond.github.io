Once upon a time, in the great story of the Mahabharata, a wise old man named Bhishma told a story. He said, "A long time ago, a king named Indra (Sakra) asked his wise teacher, Vrihaspati, a very important question."

Indra asked, "Teacher, what's the ONE thing that makes everyone like you and makes you famous?"

Vrihaspati smiled.  "Kind words, my king!  Speaking nicely to everyone is the key. It makes everyone happy.  If you're always grumpy and don't say nice things, people won't like you. But if you smile and say hello first, everyone will be happy to see you.  Even if you give someone a gift, it's not as nice without kind words. It's like having rice without curry â€“ not very tasty!  If you have to take something away from someone, do it with kind words.  Even then, people will feel better.  A good king always speaks kindly, even when he has to punish someone.  Kind words never hurt, and they always help!"

Bhishma finished the story. "Indra, the king, listened carefully and became a kinder ruler.  And you, Yudhishthira," he said to the young prince, "should also always be kind with your words."
