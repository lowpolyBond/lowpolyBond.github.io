Long ago, King Dasharatha felt very sad. He had made a big mistake.  He remembered a bad thing he did a long time ago.

He told his queen, Kaushalya, "I'm like someone who cuts down a mango tree to get pretty red flowers.  I only wanted the flowers, but now I have no mangoes!"

He explained what happened.  It was a rainy day, and he was hunting. He heard a sound near a river, like someone filling a pot. Thinking it was an elephant, he shot an arrow with poison!

A young man cried out. He was hurt.  "Who did this?" he cried. "I was just getting water. Why did you hurt me? My poor parents will be so sad!" The young man told the king how his old, blind parents relied on him.

The king was very sorry. He saw the young man bleeding.  The young man said, “Don’t worry, King. I’m not a Brahmin, so you haven’t killed a holy man.” Even though he was dying, the young man was kind.

The king pulled out the arrow. The young man closed his eyes.  The king felt terrible. He had been so thoughtless, and now a good young man was dead.  He understood that his bad actions had brought him sadness. He was very, very sorry for what he had done.  He knew this mistake would always cause him pain.
