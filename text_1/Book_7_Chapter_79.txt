Krishna, with eyes like pretty lotus flowers, went to Arjuna's room.  He made a comfy bed for Arjuna using soft grass. He put shiny weapons around the bed and added pretty flowers and sweet-smelling things.  Arjuna cleaned himself, and then they offered prayers together.

Krishna smiled gently and said, "Sleep well, Arjuna. I'll leave now." He put guards at the door and went to his own tent.  He lay down and thought hard. He wanted to help Arjuna feel better and be strong. Krishna closed his eyes and thought deeply, praying.

That night, nobody in the Pandava camp could sleep. Everyone worried about Arjuna.  Arjuna was very sad because his son had died, and he promised to kill Jayadratha.  They wondered if Arjuna could do it. Jayadratha was very strong, and he had lots of soldiers to protect him.  Arjuna made a very big promise! If he didn't kill Jayadratha, he said he would die himself!  Everyone hoped Arjuna would win.

They prayed to the gods to help Arjuna.  They talked and worried all night long.

In the middle of the night, Krishna woke up. He remembered Arjuna's promise. He told his driver, Daruka, "Arjuna promised to kill Jayadratha before the sun sets tomorrow.  Duryodhana and his friends will try to stop him.  Even Indra, the king of the gods, couldn't beat Jayadratha with all his protectors! So I will help Arjuna."

Krishna loved Arjuna very much.  He said, "I'll do everything I can to help Arjuna win. I'll fight with all my power for him! Tomorrow, everyone will see how strong I am." He told Daruka to get his chariot ready in the morning. He'd need his best weapons.

Daruka said, "Arjuna will definitely win with you driving his chariot!"
