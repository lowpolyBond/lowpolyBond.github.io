After Arjuna, the great warrior, defeated Drona, the Kuru army was in trouble. Arjuna saw something amazing!  As he fought, a glowing person, bright like fire, ran ahead of his chariot. This person didn't even throw a spear, but wherever he went, the enemy soldiers fell!  Arjuna only finished off the soldiers this glowing person had already defeated.

Arjuna asked the wise Vyasa, “Who was that amazing person?”

Vyasa said, “That was Lord Shiva, the greatest god! He is the creator of the universe,  stronger than anyone. He protects everyone. He's also called Mahadeva, Rudra, Hara, and many other names! He's awesome and has many forms and many friends, some who look a little strange."

Vyasa told Arjuna a lot of stories about Lord Shiva. He told about how angry Lord Shiva once was, so angry he destroyed a big sacrifice! The gods were very scared of him! But even when he's angry, he's still the greatest god.  Vyasa talked about how Shiva destroyed three huge enemy cities made of gold, silver, and iron – the gods couldn't defeat these cities by themselves. He told how even the god Indra was afraid of Lord Shiva.  Vyasa explained how Lord Shiva is everywhere and in everything – the wind, the sun, the moon, even day and night!  He said that Shiva has many forms, both scary and kind.

Vyasa said that Lord Shiva helped Arjuna in battle, and that’s why Arjuna was so successful. He told Arjuna to remember Lord Shiva and to keep fighting bravely.  Then Vyasa went away.  Arjuna knew he had a powerful friend on his side.
