King Yudhishthira asked, "Grandpa Bhishma, what kind of soldiers make the best fighters?"

Grandpa Bhishma said, "The best soldiers are those who are good with the weapons they know how to use.  Some groups are really good with certain weapons.

The Gandharvas, Sindhus, and Sauviras are super strong! They fight best with their hands and spears.

The Usinaras are also very strong and know how to use all kinds of weapons.

Soldiers from the East are great at fighting from elephants! They're also really clever at tricky fighting.

The Yavanas, Kamvojas, and people from Mathura are amazing at fighting without weapons.

Soldiers from the South are the best with swords.

You can find brave soldiers everywhere!  Some soldiers look like lions and tigers; they're brave and strong. Some have eyes like pigeons or snakes; they're heroes too! Soldiers with deer-like voices are very quick and active.  Those with deep voices like the clouds can throw weapons really far!

Soldiers with thin bodies are super fast and hard to beat.  Soldiers with calm faces and quick movements like horses are great fighters too.  Soldiers with broad chests who get angry when they hear the enemy's drums are very brave. They love to fight!  Soldiers with fierce eyes or green eyes are fearless. They don’t care if they die in battle!  Lean soldiers with strong arms are very quick. They are like angry elephants in battle.

Some soldiers have curly hair, big bodies, and scary faces.  They're fearless and never run away from a fight. They are so brave they would rather die than run away! These brave soldiers should always be at the front of the army!

But these brave soldiers can also be grumpy! They don't like being told what to do.  If you’re kind to them, they might get even angrier!"
