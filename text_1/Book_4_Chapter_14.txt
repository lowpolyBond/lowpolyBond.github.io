Once upon a time, the Pandava brothers, five brave princes, hid themselves in the kingdom of Virata.  They pretended to be servants for ten months.  Draupadi, their beautiful wife, also hid. She had to work as a servant for Queen Sudeshna, and it wasn't easy!

One day, the king's strong and important soldier, Kichaka, saw Draupadi. He was amazed by her beauty.  He fell in love with her instantly!  He went to his sister, Queen Sudeshna, and said, "Who is that beautiful woman? She's so lovely, she makes my heart race!"

Kichaka was very rich and powerful. He told Sudeshna he wanted Draupadi to be his wife.  He promised Draupadi a beautiful palace, lots of food, jewels, elephants, and horses! He wanted to make her queen!

Then, Kichaka went to Draupadi and showered her with compliments. He said things like, "You are as beautiful as the moon! Your eyes are like lotus flowers! You're more beautiful than any woman I've ever seen!" He begged Draupadi to be with him.

But Draupadi was a strong and loyal wife. She said, "I am a servant, and I am already married to five husbands. I cannot be with you.  It's wrong to do what you ask."

Kichaka was angry. He said, "I am very important!  I am the strongest soldier here! You should be happy to be with me!" He threatened Draupadi.

Draupadi bravely replied, "Don't be foolish! My husbands are powerful warriors, like gods!  If you try to force me, they will find you and punish you." She told him he was being like a baby trying to catch the moon. He couldn't reach her, no matter how hard he tried.

Kichaka was very angry that Draupadi refused him. This started a big problem that would have terrible consequences for him.
