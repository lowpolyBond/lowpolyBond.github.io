King Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandpa, how can someone be happy and successful in life?"

Bhishma said, "I'll tell you a story!  It's about Vasudeva, a very powerful king, and Mother Earth. Vasudeva asked Mother Earth the same question!"

Vasudeva asked, "Mother Earth, how can I live a good life as a householder?"

Mother Earth answered, "Vasudeva, you must be kind and generous. Worship the gods, and always offer food to others.  Share your food with everyone."

"Offer food to the gods, the spirits, and your ancestors," Mother Earth said. "Give food to the birds, dogs, and even the spirits at night. Always share your food with your guests!  Feed your guests first, then your family, then yourself.  Offer food to Brahmins (holy men) if you can. If not, offer it to the fire. Always be respectful to your teacher, your father, your friends, and your guests. Invite them over often. Be kind and generous always."

Bhishma concluded the story, "Vasudeva followed Mother Earth's advice, and he was very happy.  You should do the same, King Yudhishthira. If you are kind and share what you have, you will be happy here on Earth and happy in heaven after you die!"
