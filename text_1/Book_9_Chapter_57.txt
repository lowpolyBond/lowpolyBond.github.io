Once upon a time, in a great battle, Bhima and Duryodhana fought!  They were cousins, but also enemies.  They swung their big maces at each other.  *Boom!*  *Crash!*  It sounded like thunder!

They fought like two angry bulls, their blows making the ground shake.  Blood flew everywhere, but they kept fighting!  They looked like two beautiful flowers, all covered in red.  The sky even seemed to sparkle with tiny lights!

They were so strong, they tired out.  They rested a little, then swung their maces again! This time they fought like two angry elephants fighting over a friend.  Everyone watched, amazed.  Would Bhima win?  Or Duryodhana?

They circled each other, each waiting for a chance to hit the other. Their maces were huge and scary, like giant hammers. Bhima spun his mace so fast, it made a whirring sound. Duryodhana was amazed! Bhima was fast and clever, moving all around.  They fought like two playful cats, scratching and biting, but with giant maces!  

Duryodhana hit Bhima hard, but Bhima swung his mace back, making a huge, roaring sound! Duryodhana hit him again!  Bhima swung his mace, making sparks fly! It was so strong, even the wind felt scary.

They kept fighting, smashing each other with their maces like two elephants clashing with their tusks.  They were both covered in blood, but they looked amazing!  It was like a huge, exciting show!

Duryodhana hit Bhima on the head!  Bhima didnâ€™t even move! Everyone was surprised at how strong Bhima was! Then Bhima hit Duryodhana so hard, he fell to his knees!  The crowd shouted!  

Duryodhana got up, angry. He hit Bhima again, but Bhima stood still like a mountain. Bhima hit Duryodhana with his mace so hard he fell down!  The Pandavas cheered!  

But Duryodhana got up again, strong as ever! He hit Bhima so hard, Bhima's armor broke! It was a super loud battle, with even the gods watching!  Lots of flowers rained down from the sky!  Bhima was hurt, but he stood up, ready to fight on!
