Once upon a time, a wise king named Yudhishthira asked his grandfather, Bhishma, a very wise and strong man, "Grandpa, life is hard!  Everyone has problems. How can we get through them?"

Bhishma smiled.  "My dear boy," he said, "it's all about being good and kind.  People who follow the rules, who are honest and truthful, usually overcome difficulties.  

"Those who don't lie, who are polite, and don't want too much, they do well.  People who are kind to others, even when others are mean to them, those who give more than they take, they always win!

"If you're a good host to visitors, don't have bad thoughts, and study hard,  problems will be easier.  Respect your parents, don't sleep too much during the day, and be kind in your thoughts, words, and actions.  Don't hurt anyone or anything.

"If you're a king, be fair and don't take too many taxes from your people.  Keep your kingdom safe. Be faithful to your wife, and always do the right thing. Be brave, even when you are scared. Always tell the truth, even if it's hard.

"Be honest, kind, and share your wealth fairly. Study hard and pray.  If you're a religious person, dedicate your life to prayer and good works.  Always be calm and peaceful. Never be afraid, and be kind to everyone.

"Be good, don't be sad when others are happy, and always do what is right.  Pray to the gods and believe in them. Be humble, give honor to others, and worship those who deserve it.  Do good deeds and pray on important days.

"Don't get angry, and calm others when they are angry. Don't eat too much honey, meat, or drink anything that makes you dizzy.  Eat only to live, have children only when you are ready, and always speak the truth.

"Most importantly, believe in God, Narayana, he is good and powerful. He is like a protector over everyone.  Believe in him, and you will always be safe.  Remember these words. Tell your friends about them, and share them with others, and you will always overcome your difficulties.  I have given you the secret to a happy life, my child."
