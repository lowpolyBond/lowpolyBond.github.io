Prince Rama, the kindest man, left his home.  The queen and all the ladies cried.  "Where is Rama?" they sobbed. "He was so good to everyone! He never got angry. He helped everyone who was sad. He loved us all like his own mother!"

They cried and cried, like cows who've lost their babies.  King Dasharatha was heartbroken too. He missed his son terribly.  He heard the ladies crying and it made him even sadder.

Nobody felt like doing anything that day.  The priests didn't do their ceremonies.  People didn't eat.  Even the elephants and cows were sad! Mothers didn't smile at their babies.

The sky looked scary.  The stars were dim.  The planets were hidden.  The wind howled. There was even an earthquake!  Ayodhya, the city, felt very dark and sad.

Nobody ate or played. Everyone in Ayodhya missed Rama.  People walked the streets crying.  There was no sunshine, no breeze, just sadness everywhere.  Families didn't talk or care for each other.  Rama's friends were too sad to sleep.  Ayodhya felt dry and empty without him, like the earth without rain.  The city was filled with the sad sounds of crying elephants, horses, and soldiers. Everyone was very, very unhappy.
