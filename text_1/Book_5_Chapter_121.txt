King Yayati was a powerful king in heaven.  But he was very proud and mean.  He didn't treat anyone nicely.  Because of this, the gods were angry!  They kicked him out of heaven!

Whoosh!  Yayati fell from the sky.  He was scared and ashamed.  All the other gods laughed at him.  A heavenly messenger told him, "You were too proud! You can't stay in heaven!"

Yayati was sad. He wished to fall somewhere good.  He looked down and saw a beautiful, smoky cloud. It looked like a giant river of smoke rising from a big fire on Earth. He knew this was a good sign.


The smoke led Yayati to four kind kings who were doing a special ceremony.  They were having a big party for the gods!  Yayati landed right in the middle of their celebration.

The kings were surprised to see him.  "Who are you?" they asked. Yayati told them his story. He was a king who had lost his place in heaven.

The four kings were nice! They were Yayati's own relatives. They said, "You can have half of our good deeds!"  Yayati was grateful but said, "I'm a king, not a priest, I can't accept gifts like that."


Then, Yayati's daughter, Madhavi, arrived. She was very holy and had lived in the forest for many years. She saw her father and said, "Father! My sons are your grandsons.  They are good and holy. They can give you some of their good deeds!"

Madhaviâ€™s sons, the four kings, agreed. They gave their grandfather, Yayati, some of their good deeds.  Even Madhavi's husband, Galava, helped! He gave Yayati some of his good deeds, too.

Yayati got enough good deeds. He was able to go back up to heaven! He learned a very important lesson: being kind and humble is much better than being proud.
