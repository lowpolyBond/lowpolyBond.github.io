A giant battle began!  The Kurus and Pandavas fought. It was a HUGE fight, like the gods and giants fighting long ago!

Thousands of soldiers fought.  There were chariots, elephants, and horses everywhere!  The elephants were HUGE and LOUD, like thunder in a rainstorm!

Some chariot riders were knocked over by elephants. Brave soldiers ran away from the angry elephants. Other brave soldiers fought back!  They used arrows and swords.  They fought with spears and darts. They fought each other!

The elephants fought the chariots. The soldiers fought each other. It was a huge, noisy mess!  Horses ran so fast, they looked like theyâ€™d eat the earth!  The ground was all muddy from their hooves.

The battle was loud!  You could hear the chariots, the soldiers shouting, the elephants trumpeting, drums beating, and horns blowing!  It was so much noise, it was like a giant thunderstorm!

Arrows flew everywhere. Swords flashed.  The battlefield was a crazy mix of fighting!  Arms and legs were flying off.  It looked like big, broken tusks were jumping around! Heads rolled on the ground like coconuts falling from a tree.  The ground was covered in blood, it looked like red flowers.

The battlefield was full of dead soldiers and animals. Elephants and horses lay dead in huge piles.  It looked like mountains of dead bodies. There was so much blood, it looked like a river of red water!  It had dead bodies, broken weapons, and everything else from the battle.

Then, Arjuna and Bhima, two super strong Pandava brothers, fought really hard! They scared the Kuru army. The Kuru soldiers ran away! They screamed and cried.  They left their friends and family behind!  They just wanted to get away!

It was a terrible, terrible battle.  Many, many soldiers died.
