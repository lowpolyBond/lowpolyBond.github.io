Once upon a time, the Pandava brothers were traveling to a new city.  Yudhishthira, the oldest brother, was worried. He closed his eyes and prayed to Goddess Durga, a very powerful goddess.

He remembered how Durga, also called Kali, was born to Yasoda and was very brave. She was strong and beautiful, like the sun and the moon. She had four arms and four faces, and she wore amazing jewelry. She was a great warrior, always fighting evil. She was like a friend to those who needed help.

Yudhishthira said, “Oh Goddess, you are so amazing! You are like Krishna! You are pure and strong. You have a beautiful face, and you fight with a sword and shield. You save people just like a mother protects her calf. Please help us!”

He described her many amazing qualities. He praised her beauty, her strength, and her kindness. He told her about how he and his brothers had lost their kingdom and needed her help.

Yudhishthira prayed, "Great Goddess, you are victory itself. Please give us victory over our enemies and bring back our kingdom! You live on the Vindhya mountains, and you're always helping those in need. Please protect us!"

The Goddess Durga heard his prayer. She appeared before Yudhishthira and said, "Brave king, I will help you. You will win your battles, and you will get your kingdom back! Your brothers will be safe. Everyone who remembers and prays to me will be blessed with good health, happiness, and long life.”

Durga also promised to keep the Pandavas hidden from their enemies in the new city. Then, she disappeared.  Yudhishthira and his brothers felt much better, knowing the Goddess was on their side. They continued their journey with hope in their hearts.
