Yudhishthira asked his grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandpa, tell me about Suka!  How was he born? How did he become so wise? Who was his mother?"

Bhishma smiled. "Being wise isn't about how old you are, how rich you are, or how many friends you have," he said. "It's about learning and doing good things. Suka's wisdom came from his hard work and special prayers.  It all started with controlling his feelings and thoughts.  That's very important."

"Suka's father was Vyasa," Bhishma continued. "Vyasa wanted a very special son.  He went to a beautiful mountain, Mount Meru, where many gods and goddesses lived. He prayed very hard for a son who would be as strong as the earth, the wind, the fire, the water, and the sky!"

"Vyasa sat there for one hundred years! He only ate air and he prayed and prayed.  All the gods and goddesses came to watch him. They were amazed by his strong will.  His hair even glowed like fire!"

"Finally," Bhishma said, "the great god Mahadeva was so happy with Vyasa's hard work, he smiled and said, 'You will have a son just as you wished! He will be pure and wise, and he will understand everything about the world!'"

"And that's how Suka was born," Bhishma finished. "A very, very special boy who became a very wise man."
