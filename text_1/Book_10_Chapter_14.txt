Krishna, a super strong warrior, knew Ashwatthama's weapon was dangerous.  He told Arjuna, "Arjuna, you need to use your special weapon, the one your teacher Drona taught you. Use it to protect yourself and your brothers!"

Arjuna, a great archer, quickly jumped off his chariot. He held his bow and arrow.  He wished good luck to Ashwatthama, his brothers, and himself. He prayed to the gods and then fired his arrow, saying, "Let this arrow stop Ashwatthama's weapon!"

WHOOSH! Arjuna's arrow shot out like a giant, fiery dragon! Ashwatthama's arrow was also a huge ball of fire.  BOOM! It sounded like thunder!  Lots of shooting stars fell from the sky. Everyone was scared! The whole world shook!

Two wise men, Narada and Vyasa, saw the scary fire arrows.  They were worried.  They were so powerful, they stood between the two fiery arrows. They stopped the arrows from hurting anyone.

The wise men said, "These powerful arrows are too dangerous!  Warriors never used weapons this strong on other people.  This is very dangerous!"
