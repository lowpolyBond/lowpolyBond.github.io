King Dhritarashtra, listen!  A huge battle raged between the Pandavas and the Kauravas.

The Pandavas fought hard to break through Drona’s army.  Drona and his soldiers fought back bravely.  Two strong warriors from Avanti, Vinda and Anuvinda, wanted to help the Kauravas, so they shot many arrows at King Virata.  Virata fought back fiercely!  It was a terrible fight, like a lion battling two big elephants.

Then, Yudhishthira's son fought King Valhika.  They shot many arrows at each other.  The arrows flew everywhere – it was a crazy arrow storm!

King Saivya fought a Kasi prince.  It was like two elephants crashing!  The King of the Valhikas fought five Pandava princes. He was brave, like the mind fighting our five senses!  The princes shot back, like our senses always fighting our body.

Duhsasana shot many arrows at Satyaki.  Satyaki was hurt, but he fought back and shot many arrows at Duhsasana!  They were both hurt, but they looked beautiful, like bright red flowers.

Alamvusha fought Kuntibhoja.  Alamvusha was hurt, but he shouted loudly and fought on.  It was like a big fight between gods and demons long ago.

The Pandava brothers, Nakula and Sahadeva, were very angry with Sakuni and shot many arrows at him.  They made him run away!  They chased him and shot even more arrows.  He ran to hide in Drona's army.

Ghatotkacha fought Alamvusha.  It was a scary fight, like Rama and Ravana's fight long ago!

Yudhishthira shot many arrows at the King of Madras.  Their fight was amazing, like a big fight between gods and demons long ago.

Finally, three Kaurava princes, Vivinsati, Chitrasena, and Vikarna, fought Bhima.  It was a huge, noisy battle, full of fighting and arrows!
