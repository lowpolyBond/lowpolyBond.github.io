Once upon a time, a very kind king was sitting when a hungry hawk swooped down.  "King," the hawk cried, "everyone says you're a good ruler. Why won't you let me eat this pigeon? I'm starving!"

The king said, "This little pigeon is scared and ran to me for help. Isn't it better to protect someone who needs it?"

The hawk argued, "But I need food to live!  My family will starve if I don't eat.  It's not good to be too kind if it hurts others."

The king replied, "I'll give you other food.  A deer? A boar?  Anything you want!"

The hawk shook his head. "I only want this pigeon.  Hawks eat pigeons, that's the way of things."

The king was sad. He really wanted to help both the hawk and the pigeon.  Then the hawk said, "If you love this pigeon so much, weigh a piece of your own flesh against it.  If it weighs the same, you can give me the flesh."

The king agreed! He cut off a piece of his own body.  But it wasn't enough. He cut off more and more until he had almost no flesh left! He was very thin and weak.

Suddenly, the hawk smiled. "I am Indra, the king of the gods," he said. "And the pigeon was Agni, the god of fire! We wanted to test your kindness. You passed the test! Your goodness will be remembered forever!"

Then Indra flew away. The kind king, Usinara, went to live happily in heaven, because he was so good and kind.  His story is told to this day, to remind everyone that true goodness is very important.
