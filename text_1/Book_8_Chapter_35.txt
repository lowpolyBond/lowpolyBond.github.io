Once upon a time, during a great battle, Duryodhana, a powerful king, asked Shalya, a skilled charioteer, to drive Karna's chariot.  Duryodhana said, "Remember how in a battle long ago, the great god Brahma himself drove Lord Shiva's chariot?  The charioteer should be as strong as the warrior.  You're the best, so please drive Karna's chariot!"

Shalya thought about this. He knew the story Duryodhana told. He knew that Krishna, another powerful god, was Arjuna's charioteer. Shalya warned Duryodhana, "If Karna kills Arjuna, Krishna will be furious! He'll destroy your whole army!"

Duryodhana wasn't scared. He boasted about Karna's amazing strength. "Karna's so strong," he said, "he defeated Bhima, the Pandavas' strongest warrior! He even made Arjuna afraid!  Even Satyaki, a brave warrior, couldn't beat him!  You're even stronger than Krishna. Drive for Karna, and together you will win!"

Shalya, though a little worried, agreed. But he made a deal with Karna.  "I'll drive for you," he said, "but I'll say whatever I want, even if it's not nice!"

Karna and Duryodhana were happy. Duryodhana hugged Karna and cheered him on. He urged Karna to defeat Arjuna. Shalya, still a little unsure, agreed again to be Karna's charioteer.  Karna asked Duryodhana to be kind to Shalya, as he seemed hesitant. So, Duryodhana spoke sweetly to Shalya, asking him again to drive Karna’s chariot, assuring him of his importance in the battle.

Shalya finally agreed, saying, "I'll do my best for you! But please forgive me if I say anything that upsets you during the battle."

Karna said, “Drive well, just as Brahma drove for Shiva, and Krishna for Arjuna!”

Shalya said, “I’m a great driver.  I’m as good as the best!  I know how to keep you safe. Don't worry, I’ll drive your chariot perfectly!" And so, Shalya became Karna's charioteer.
