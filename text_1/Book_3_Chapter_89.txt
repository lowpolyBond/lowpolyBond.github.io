Dhaumya said, "Yudhishthira, let me tell you about some amazing holy places in the west, in the Anarta country!  There's a beautiful river called Narmada. It flows west, surrounded by mango trees and lots of tall reeds.

Many, many holy places are near the Narmada.  Even the gods, and wise people called Rishis, come to bathe in its waters!  It's said that Kuvera, the king of riches, was born near there!

There's a wonderful mountain called Vaidurya. It's always covered in green trees, flowers, and fruits.  At the top, there's a special lake where the gods and heavenly beings go!

Another river, called Viswamitra, is also very holy.  King Yayati fell from heaven, but he became good again after bathing in this river.

There are also a beautiful lake called Punya, and mountains called Mainaka and Asita, full of yummy fruits and plants.  There were even homes of holy people there â€“ Kakshasena and Chyavana!  People could become holy there without even trying too hard!

There's a peaceful place called Jamvumarga, full of birds and deer, where quiet people lived.  Then there's Ketumala and Medhya, and Gangadwara, all very holy places.  There are also beautiful woods called Saindhava, where good people live.

And finally, there's a special lake called Pushkara. It's a favorite place of the gods and wise people!  The Creator himself sang a song about it. He said, even just *thinking* about visiting Pushkara can wash away your sins and make you happy in heaven!"
