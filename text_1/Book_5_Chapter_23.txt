Once upon a time, after a long war, King Dhritarashtra, who was blind, sent his messenger, Sanjaya, to visit the Pandavas, who were like super-strong heroes.

Sanjaya went to see Yudhishthira, the Pandava king. He bowed down and said, "King Yudhishthira, I bring greetings from the old king! He wants to know if you and your brothers, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva, are all well.  He also asked about your wife, Draupadi, and your sons."

Yudhishthira was happy to see Sanjaya. He asked, "Sanjaya, how are you?  Tell me, how is our grandfather Bhishma?  And how is King Dhritarashtra? Is he well with his sons? How are all the other people in his kingdom:  Vahlika, Somadatta, Bhurisravas,  Drona, his son Ashwatthama, Kripa, Karna, and even Yuyutsu, who is Dhritarashtra's son from another wife?  Is everyone healthy and happy?  Are the Brahmins (priests) being treated well and are they getting the gifts that we gave them? Are the king and his sons being fair to everyone?"

Yudhishthira went on, "Sanjaya, I hope no one is spreading lies about us.  Do they remember Arjuna's amazing archery skills? He could shoot so many arrows at once!  Do they remember Bhima's strength? He’s as strong as an elephant! Do they remember Nakula and Sahadeva’s bravery in battle? They fought bravely and won many battles.

"Do they remember how badly the Kauravas (Dhritarashtra’s sons) treated us and how we were forced to live in the forest? Do they remember how Bhima and Arjuna saved us?

"Sanjaya, it’s not enough to do just one good thing.  We’ve tried our best, but we can’t seem to make peace with the Kauravas!"
