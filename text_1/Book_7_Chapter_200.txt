Once upon a time, during a great battle, Aswatthaman, Drona's son, fought like a fierce warrior. He was so strong he made a huge pile of dead soldiers!  It looked like a mountain made of broken chariots, weapons, dead elephants, and horses.  Even scary birds and spirits were there.

Aswatthaman shouted, "Because Yudhishthira, the Pandava prince, tricked my father, I will destroy his army! I will kill everyone who fights me!"  Yudhishthira's brother, hearing this, fought bravely.

The battle was like two giant oceans crashing together!  Aswatthaman used a powerful weapon called the Narayana weapon.  Thousands of fiery arrows flew through the sky, like snakes of fire!  They were so many that they covered everything â€“ the sky, the ground, and the soldiers.

The Pandava soldiers were scared.  Yudhishthira was terrified. He told his friends to run away! He even said he and his brothers would rather die than fight anymore.

Then, Krishna, a wise friend of the Pandavas, told everyone to drop their weapons and get off their chariots.  He said, "If you're weaponless on the ground, the Narayana weapon can't hurt you!"

Bhima, another Pandava brother, was brave.  He refused to drop his weapons! He said he would fight Aswatthaman. Bhima was incredibly strong, like a mountain himself! He charged at Aswatthaman.

But Aswatthaman was also strong, and he shot many fiery arrows at Bhima.  Bhima was covered in fire, just like a mountain on fire at sunset. The Narayana weapon got even stronger, and the other Pandava soldiers, except Bhima, got scared and dropped their weapons. The weapon struck Bhima! Everyone cried out in fear as Bhima was hit by the powerful weapon.
