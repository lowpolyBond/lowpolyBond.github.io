Once upon a time, during a great war, a brave king named Shalya decided to join the battle. He told his driver, "Go quickly! Take me to King Yudhishthira. I'll show them my strength!" Shalya was super strong and he stopped the Pandava army all by himself, just like a huge mountain stops a big wave!

Seeing Shalya, the Kaurava army got ready to fight too.  The battle was fierce! Arrows flew everywhere like rain.

Nakula, a Pandava prince, fought against Chitrasena.  They were both amazing archers!  They shot arrows at each other like two stormy clouds.  Chitrasena broke Nakula's bow. He then hit Nakula with more arrows, even hitting Nakula's horses!  Nakula's chariot was destroyed, but he jumped out like a lion and kept fighting! He found another chariot and fought bravely. Nakula even cut off Chitrasena's head!

Then, Chitrasena’s brothers, Sushena and Satyasena, got angry and attacked Nakula. They shot many arrows. Nakula's chariot was destroyed again and again, but he kept getting new ones! He fought so bravely, even though he was covered in arrows.  Nakula even killed Satyasena with a special dart!

Sushena got very angry and destroyed Nakula’s chariot again. But Nakula’s nephew, Sutasoma, helped him! Nakula got on Sutasoma’s chariot and kept fighting.  Finally, Nakula killed Sushena too!

Seeing their brothers die, the Kaurava army was scared, but Shalya, their brave king, encouraged them. He fought bravely, shouting loudly. Both armies fought hard, shooting arrows and shouting.  It was a huge, scary battle, just like the battles between the gods and giants of old!  Many soldiers from both sides died. The fighting was so intense and terrible that everyone was very afraid.
