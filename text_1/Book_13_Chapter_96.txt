Once upon a time, a very powerful and wise holy man named Jamadagni was very, very angry.  The sun god, Surya, tried to calm him down. He begged and pleaded, but Jamadagni wouldn't listen!

Surya, dressed as a normal person, bowed down and said, "Great holy man, I'm always moving! How can you possibly hit me with your arrows?"

Jamadagni, who was super smart, replied, "I know you move, but for a short time each day, you seem to stop in the sky.  That's when I'll shoot you! I won't change my mind!"

Surya was scared. "Please, I'm asking for your mercy!" he begged.

Jamadagni smiled. "Since you're asking for my protection, you're safe!" he said.  "Anyone who hurts someone who asks for help is really, really bad. They're as bad as someone who is unkind to their teacher, hurts a holy person, or drinks too much alcohol.  Think of a way to help people who are too hot from your rays."

Surya thought for a moment. Then he gave Jamadagni a beautiful umbrella and a pair of comfy sandals.

"Use the umbrella to block my strong rays," Surya said, "and wear the sandals to protect your feet. From now on, giving umbrellas and sandals will be a very good thing to do."

And so it became a tradition!  Bhishma, a great warrior, told this story to Yudhishthira, explaining that giving umbrellas and sandals to kind, holy people is a really good deed.  It brings good luck and helps you go to a wonderful place after you die!  Giving a special umbrella to a holy man brings even more good fortune!
