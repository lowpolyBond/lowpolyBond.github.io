Once upon a time, some wise people asked Markandeya, a very, very old man, "Are you the oldest person ever?"

Markandeya said, "No, there's a king named Indradyumna. He was once a great king in heaven, but he did some bad things and fell down to Earth. He's looking for someone who knows him."

Indradyumna found Markandeya and asked, "Do you know me?" Markandeya said, "I travel all the time, I don't know everyone!"

Indradyumna asked, "Then who's older than you?"

Markandeya said, "There's a very old owl named Pravarakarna on a big mountain called Himavat.  He might know you."

Indradyumna turned into a horse! He carried Markandeya to the owl. Indradyumna asked the owl, "Do you know me?"

The owl said, "Nope!"

Indradyumna asked, "Who's older than you?"

The owl said, "There's a crane named Nadijangha in a lake. He's much older."

So Indradyumna, Markandeya, and the owl went to the lake. They asked the crane, "Do you know King Indradyumna?"

The crane said, "No."

"Who's older?" they asked.

The crane said, "There's a very old tortoise named Akupara in this lake. He might know him."

The crane told the tortoise, "Some people want to ask you something."

The tortoise came out of the lake.  When they asked him, "Do you know King Indradyumna?", the tortoise's eyes filled with tears!  He remembered! He said, "Of course! I remember him!  I've lived here ever since he did a big, good sacrifice a long, long time ago!"

Suddenly, a shining chariot appeared from the sky! A voice boomed, "King Indradyumna, come back to heaven! You've done good things!"

Indradyumna said, "Wait! I'll take my new friends home first."  He took Markandeya and the owl back. Then he went up to heaven in the chariot.

Markandeya, being so old, saw everything. He told the story to some princes.  The princes were amazed. Markandeya said, "Even Krishna, a very powerful god, helped another king back to heaven once!"  And that's how Indradyumna got back to where he belonged.
