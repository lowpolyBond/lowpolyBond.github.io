Once upon a time, a wise old man named Bhishma talked to Maitreya.  He said, "Maitreya, you're very lucky! You're smart and kind.  You're not fooled by beauty or riches.  The gods are watching over you! But there's something even better than luck: doing good things!"

Bhishma explained that everything good in the world comes from following the ancient teachings, the Vedas.  He praised giving to others.  "Penances," he said, "are like super-duper good deeds. They're like magic!  They help you learn the Vedas, go to heaven, and get rid of bad things you've done."

"Penances," he continued, "are like superpowers!  They can help you do anything, even if it seems impossible.  Even people who do bad things, like drinking too much or hurting others, can be forgiven if they do penances."

Bhishma said that being wise and doing penances are equally important. "We should always respect wise people and those who do penances," he said.  "Giving things to others makes you happy now and in the future. It brings good luck!"

He told Maitreya, "You're lucky because you're smart, kind, and young. Keep following the good path.  A happy family is a good family.  Just like water cleans your body and fire chases away darkness, giving things to others and doing good deeds washes away your bad actions."

Bhishma said goodbye. Maitreya bowed down and thanked him.  He promised to remember everything Bhishma said.  And that's how Maitreya learned about the power of goodness!
