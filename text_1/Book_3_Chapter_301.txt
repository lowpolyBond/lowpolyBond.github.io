King Janamejaya was curious.  "Tell me," he asked, "the secret the sun god didn't tell Karna!  What were his magic earrings and armor? Where did they come from?"

Vaisampayana said, "I will!  Long ago, a strong, handsome Brahman – a wise holy man – came to King Kuntibhoja's palace. He had long hair and a beard, and he carried a walking stick. He asked to stay at the palace, and eat whatever food was given to him. He said he'd leave when he wanted and come back whenever he liked.  King Kuntibhoja happily agreed.

The Brahman then said, "I want your kind daughter, Pritha, to take care of me."  Kuntibhoja agreed. He told Pritha, "This Brahman is very important.  Be kind and give him anything he wants. Brahmans are very powerful. If you make him angry, bad things will happen!"

Pritha was a good girl. She always helped everyone, even the servants. She was kind and smart and lovely.  Kuntibhoja said Pritha was from a very important family.  Her father loved her very much and gave her away happily when she was a baby, promising to give his first-born child away. He said to Pritha, "Be very kind to this Brahman, my dear girl. If you upset him, we'll all be in great trouble!"
