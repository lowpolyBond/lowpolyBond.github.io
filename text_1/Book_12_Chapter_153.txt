Once upon a time, a king asked his grandfather, a wise old man, "Grandpa, have you ever heard of someone coming back to life after they died?"

Grandpa Bhishma said, "Yes, I have! Listen to this story:  In a big forest, a family had a little boy with beautiful, big eyes. Sadly, the little boy got very sick and died.  His family was so heartbroken! They carried him to the place where people were cremated. They cried and cried. They couldn't leave him."

"A vulture flew down and said, 'Leave him. Everyone dies.  No one comes back to life.  Go home.' The family was sad, but they started to leave.

Then, a black jackal popped out! 'Don't go!' he cried. 'Don't give up!  Maybe he can come back to life! Show him some love!'

The family felt hopeful again. They stayed."


The vulture came back.  "He's dead! Don't be silly! Go home!"

The jackal said, "No, wait!  Maybe a good god will help!"

The family was confused.  They kept crying.  Suddenly, a very powerful god appeared! He saw how sad the family was. He felt sorry for them and brought the little boy back to life! The family was overjoyed!


Grandpa Bhishma smiled.  "The vulture showed the family that everyone dies, but the jackal showed them that hope is important.  Sometimes, if you keep hoping, amazing things can happen."
