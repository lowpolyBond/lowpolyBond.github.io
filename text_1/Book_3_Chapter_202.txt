Once upon a time, a wise king named Vrihadaswa met a holy man named Utanka. Utanka asked the king for help with something important.  Vrihadaswa said, "My son Kuvalaswa is strong and brave.  He and his sons will help you." Then the king went away to the forest.

Yudhishthira, a prince, wanted to know a story about a powerful giant, a Daitya. He asked the wise Markandeya to tell him.

Markandeya said, "Long ago, the whole world was covered in water.  Everything was destroyed!  Then Vishnu, a powerful god, slept on a giant snake. A beautiful lotus flower grew from his belly button.  From the lotus came Brahma, another important god."

Two evil giants, Madhu and Kaitabha, saw Brahma and scared him. Brahma was so scared that he shook, making the lotus flower shake. This woke up Vishnu!

Vishnu said, "I'll give you a gift!" The giants said, "Give *us* a gift! We'll give you anything you want!"

Vishnu said, "I want you to die. It's for the good of the world."

The giants said, "We always tell the truth. But we want a special wish: You must kill us in a place with absolutely no cover. And, we want to be your sons."

Vishnu agreed. He looked around, but there was no uncovered place! Then, he saw his own legs were uncovered.  So, Vishnu used his magic disc to cut off the heads of Madhu and Kaitabha right there!  That's how they became Vishnu's sons.
