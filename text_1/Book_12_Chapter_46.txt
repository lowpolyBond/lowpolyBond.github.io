After the big war, Yudhishthira, the good king, got his kingdom back!  King Janamejaya wanted to know what happened next.

Vaisampayana, the storyteller, said, "Listen!  Yudhishthira was a kind king. He gave lots of money to wise Brahmins. He made sure everyone was happy – even people who weren’t always nice! He gave his priest, Dhaumya, lots of cows and treasures. He treated his teacher, Kripa, with great respect. He was especially good to Vidura, his uncle.  He gave food, clothes, and comfortable beds to everyone. He was also very kind to Dhritarashtra, his uncle, and Gandhari, his aunt. He shared his kingdom with them! He made everyone happy.  Then, Yudhishthira went to see Krishna, his best friend."

Krishna was amazing!  He was very handsome, dressed in beautiful yellow clothes and sparkling jewelry. He looked like the sun rising over a mountain! Yudhishthira bowed and said, "Krishna, we won the war because of you! We have our kingdom back, thanks to you, our great friend!"

But Krishna didn't answer. He was thinking very deeply and quietly.
