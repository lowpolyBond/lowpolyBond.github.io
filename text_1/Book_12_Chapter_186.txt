A wise man named Bharadwaja was thinking about life and death.  He wondered: "If wind makes us breathe and move, is life really that simple?"  He thought about how our bodies digest food like a fire.  "If that's all we are, then when we die, where does that fire and wind go?"

When an animal dies, you don't see its life leave. Only its breath stops, and its inner fire goes out.  If life was just wind, it would float away like smoke, right? Like water drops into the ocean, disappearing.

Our bodies are made of five things: earth, water, fire, air, and space.  If even one of these is gone, the whole body falls apart.  If we don't eat, our water dries up. If we stop breathing, the air is gone. If we don't go to the bathroom, space inside changes.  If we don't eat, our inner fire dies out.  Our bodies can break from sickness or injury.

So Bharadwaja asked, "If our body breaks apart, where does our life go? What does it see? What does it hear? What does it do?"

Sometimes, people think giving a cow to a holy person will help them in the afterlife. But even that holy person will die!  What good is the cow then?  Everyone dies eventually.  Someone who falls off a mountain, or gets burned in a fire, or is eaten by birds...they don't come back to life, do they?

A tree can't grow back from a chopped-off stump, only from a seed.  Bharadwaja said, "Life is like that too.  Everything comes from seeds. When we die, we're gone.  Just like seeds make new plants, maybe life keeps going on in a different way through things we leave behind."
