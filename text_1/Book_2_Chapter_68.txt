King Dasharatha, Rama's father, had died.  The wise priest Vasishtha needed to bring Rama's brothers, Bharata and Shatrughna, back home.  Bharata and Shatrughna were staying with their uncle.

Vasishtha told some fast runners, "Go get Bharata and Shatrughna!  Don't tell them about the king's death or that Rama is gone.  Take them nice gifts!"

The runners, Siddartha, Vijaya, Jayanta, Asoka, and Nandana, said, "Yes, we will!"

They hopped on their super-fast horses.  Their journey was long!  They rode past sparkling rivers and beautiful lakes.  They saw amazing animals like lions and tigers.  Sometimes, the horses got tired, but the runners kept going. They wanted to bring Bharata and Shatrughna home quickly.

They traveled across mountains and rivers.  They even saw a special tree and a place where the god Vishnu had walked!  The trip took a long, long time.

Finally, after many days and nights, they arrived at Bharataâ€™s city.  It was getting dark, but they still went straight to Bharata's house. They were determined to complete their important mission.
