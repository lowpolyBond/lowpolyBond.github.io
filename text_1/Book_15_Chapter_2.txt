Once upon a time, after a big war, the Pandava brothers lived with their uncle, King Dhritarashtra.  Dhritarashtra was sad because his sons had died.

Yudhishthira, the oldest Pandava, was very kind. He always showed respect to his uncle. He told his brothers, "We must honor Dhritarashtra. Anyone who is not kind to him is my enemy!"

The Pandavas were very good to Dhritarashtra. They did everything he asked.  They made sure he was happy and comfortable, even though he was very sad.  They gave gifts to Brahmins (wise people) just like Dhritarashtra liked.  They wanted him to be happy, even though his sadness was caused by their actions in the war.

Dhritarashtra's wife, Gandhari, was also very sad. She performed special ceremonies and gave gifts to make her feel better about her lost sons.

Dhritarashtra was so happy with the Pandavas' kindness. He loved them like his own sons.  He could see how good and kind they really were.  Gandhari also started to love them. She forgot her sadness and loved them like her own children.

Yudhishthira always did what Dhritarashtra asked.  He never did anything to upset him. He even forgave all the bad things Dhritarashtra's sons had done to him.

Dhritarashtra was so happy. He loved the Pandavas more than his own sons. Every morning, he would pray for them and wish them good luck.

However, Bhima, another Pandava brother, wasn't as happy. He pretended to be respectful, but inside, he still felt angry about what Dhritarashtra's sons had done.  Even though he obeyed, his heart wasn't really in it.  Dhritarashtra and Gandhari knew this.  They liked Yudhishthira more than Bhima.  Everyone was afraid to say anything bad about Dhritarashtra because Yudhishthira was so strict.
