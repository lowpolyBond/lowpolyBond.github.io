Once upon a time, in the land of Bharatavarsha, the wise king Yudhishthira asked his grandfather, Bhishma, a very important question.  "Grandfather," he said, "people are supposed to live for a hundred years. Why do some people die so young? How can someone live a long, happy life?"

Bhishma smiled. "Yudhishthira," he said, "the answer is simple: good behavior!  Being kind and good makes you live longer, get wealth, and become famous.  Being bad makes your life short and unhappy. People are scared of unkind people."

Bhishma explained many ways to be good:

* **Be kind to everyone.** Don't hurt animals or plants. Don't be grumpy or impatient. Don't gossip or say mean things.  Kind words are like medicine for the soul! Mean words hurt deeply and can even shorten your life.

* **Pray and be respectful.** Wake up early and say your prayers. Pray again in the evening. Be respectful to your elders, especially your parents and teachers.

* **Be clean and pure.** Wash your hands and face. Brush your teeth.  Keep your body clean. Don't look at unpleasant things.

* **Be honest and fair.** Don't cheat or steal. Don't be mean to anyone, even if they are poor or different.  Don't lie.

* **Be respectful to the Gods.** Pray regularly. Offer food to the Gods.

* **Be careful and thoughtful.** Don't walk in dangerous places. Don't eat or sleep in dirty places. Don't sleep facing North or West.

* **Choose good friends.** Don't hang out with people who are mean or unkind. Don't trust strangers!

* **Don't be greedy.** Share your food and things with others. Give to those who need help.

* **Treat your family with respect.**  Honor your parents and grandparents.  Love your siblings.

* **Be a good spouse.**  Always treat your wife or husband with respect and kindness.

* **Live a good life.** Follow the rules of your religion.  Always do what is right, even when it's hard.

Bhishma told Yudhishthira many more rules for a long and happy life.  He said that being good is like magic! It brings health, wealth, happiness, and a long life.  He finished by saying, "Remember, Yudhishthira, good behavior is the key to everything good in life.‚Äù
