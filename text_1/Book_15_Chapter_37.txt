Once upon a time, two years after the Pandavas came home, a wise man named Narada visited King Yudhishthira.  Yudhishthira welcomed him warmly.  He asked Narada, "Wise man, where have you been?  How is everyone?"

Narada said, "I've traveled far, seen many rivers, even the great Ganga River!"

Yudhishthira worried, "People say my father, King Dhritarashtra, is doing very hard prayers near the Ganga.  Have you seen him? How are he, my mother Kunti, and Gandhari?  And Sanjaya?"

Narada told him, "King Dhritarashtra went to the Ganga River with Gandhari, Kunti, and Sanjaya. They did very hard prayers.  He ate almost nothing, and only drank air. He was very thin after six months. Gandhari only drank water, and Kunti ate very little.  They moved from place to place, following their sacred fire.  Sanjaya helped them travel."

"One day," Narada continued, "a big fire started in the forest. The animals ran away. The king, so weak from his prayers, couldn't move!  His wives were too weak too.  He told Sanjaya, 'Let's let the fire take us. We will reach heaven.' But Sanjaya said, 'No, this isn't a good way to die!'  The king said, 'We chose this life. It's okay.'  He sat with Gandhari and Kunti, facing the east.  Sanjaya escaped the fire and told me what happened."

Narada said, "I saw the king and the queens' bodies. Many people came, but they weren't sad. They died peacefully while praying."

Yudhishthira was very sad when he heard this.  He cried.  His brothers and the palace ladies cried too.  Everyone was heartbroken.  But then Yudhishthira, being brave and kind, stopped crying. He knew his father, mother, and Gandhari had died peacefully.
