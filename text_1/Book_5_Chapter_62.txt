Once upon a time, during a big war, Karna, a brave warrior, wanted to fight for his friends. He boasted to King Dhritarashtra, "I have a powerful weapon! I got it from a wise man.  I can defeat anyone! I'll defeat Arjuna and his army. I'll win you lots of land!"

But a wise old warrior named Bhishma said, "Karna, your confidence is misplaced.  Arjuna is very strong. He even fought a huge fire with his friend Krishna. Your special weapons won't work against Arjuna. Krishna will protect Arjuna."

Karna was proud. He argued a little, then said, "You're right. I won't fight."  He put down his weapons and went home.

Bhishma laughed. He said to Duryodhana, "Look at Karna! He always promises to win big battles, but he never does.  He even tricked a wise man to get his special weapon!  That's not fair!" Duryodhana, Karna's friend, was sad and worried.  He listened to Bhishma.  The war was going to be tough!
