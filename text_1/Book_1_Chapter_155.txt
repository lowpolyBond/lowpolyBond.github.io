Once upon a time, the Pandava brothers were sleeping in the forest.  Hidimva, a Rakshasa (a kind of monster), was worried because his sister hadn't come back.  He was big and scary! He had red eyes, big strong arms, and sharp teeth. He looked like a dark cloud.

Hidimva's sister was scared of her brother.  She told Bhima, the strongest Pandava brother, "My brother is angry! He's coming! He's a scary monster!"  She offered to carry Bhima and his brothers to safety on her back, but Bhima said, "Don't worry! I'll take care of him." Bhima was super strong.  He had arms like tree trunks and legs like iron!

Hidimva's sister had met the Pandavas and was secretly happy to be with them.  When Hidimva saw his sister with the Pandavas, he got very angry. He thought she was being bad. He yelled at her, "What are you doing? You’re making me angry!"

Bhima laughed.  He told Hidimva, "Don't hurt your sister!  She didn't do anything wrong. Fight me instead!"  Bhima was very brave. He challenged Hidimva to a fight.

Hidimva said, "Okay, strong man, let's fight! But if you lose, I’ll eat you and your brothers!"

So Bhima and Hidimva started to fight!  They were both super strong.  They wrestled and pulled each other.  They knocked down trees! The noise woke up Bhima's brothers and their mother. They saw Hidimva and Bhima fighting. Bhima was so strong that he easily beat Hidimva! The fight was amazing to see!
