Once upon a time, in the land of gods and goddesses, there lived a beautiful Apsara named Urvasi. She really liked Arjuna, a brave warrior.  She took a bath, put on her prettiest jewelry, and felt very excited. She imagined dancing with Arjuna.  When the moon came out, Urvasi went to find Arjuna. She looked so beautiful that even the moon seemed shy! Her walk was graceful, and she was so lovely everyone stopped to admire her.

Urvasi quickly arrived at Arjuna's house and asked to see him.  When Arjuna saw her, he was so shy he closed his eyes! He bowed respectfully and asked what she wanted.

Urvasi told Arjuna a secret.  A god named Indra had thrown a big party in heaven.  Everyone was there – gods, goddesses, and magical creatures!  Arjuna had been there too.  He’d looked at Urvasi, and a god had told her to find Arjuna.  Urvasi admitted she liked Arjuna very much.

Arjuna was embarrassed. He told Urvasi that he saw her at the party but thought she was someone else. He said Urvasi was like a mother figure to him and treated her with the same respect he showed his own mother.

Urvasi was angry!  She was upset that Arjuna didn't feel the same way.  She was a powerful goddess, so she cursed Arjuna!  She said he would have to live for a year as a dancer, without being a man.

Arjuna told the god Chitrasena, who had asked Urvasi to find him, what had happened.  Chitrasena told Indra. Indra, Arjuna’s father, comforted him. He explained that the curse would only last a year and that it would happen during Arjuna’s exile on Earth. After that, everything would be okay.

Arjuna felt better and played with Chitrasena in heaven.  This story teaches us that even heroes can make mistakes, and sometimes, even a curse can have a happy ending.  And, listening to this story helps us be kind and good.
