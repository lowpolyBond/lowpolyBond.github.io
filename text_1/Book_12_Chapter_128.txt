King Viradyumna was very sad. His only son, Bhuridyumna, was lost!  He searched everywhere for him, even in a big forest.  He met a wise holy man, Rishabha.  The king asked for help.

Another holy man, Tanu, was there too. He was quiet.  A long time ago, the king hadn't been very nice to Tanu.  Tanu was angry and didn't want anything from the king.  He believed hope was a silly thing.

King Viradyumna asked Tanu, "What is the smallest thing in the world?"

Tanu said, "Hope is the smallest thing. It's very hard to get what you hope for!" He told the king a story:

He said, "It’s hard to find someone who is always happy. It’s even harder to find someone who always keeps their promises. Hope is very small when you depend on people like that."

He told the king that hope was even smaller when someone was ungrateful, mean, lazy, or hurt others.  He said hoping to see his lost son again was even smaller hope than all those!  The hope that old ladies had of having babies, or rich people had of getting richer, was smaller than his hope. Even a young girl's hope for marriage was very small.

The king understood. He was so sad because his hope was tiny!

Then, Tanu, who was really a powerful god, smiled.  With his magic, he brought the king's son back! He showed the king he was a god, then disappeared.

Rishabha told King Viradyumna, "Let go of your worry.  Your hope was so small and fragile, like a tiny little thread."

So the king stopped worrying. He learned that sometimes, letting go of worry is better than holding onto hope.
