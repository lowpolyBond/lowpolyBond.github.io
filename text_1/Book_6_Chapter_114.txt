Once upon a time, in a great war, many brave warriors fought on the battlefield.  Bhima, a strong Pandava warrior, was facing ten mighty kings!

These kings were Bhagadatta, Kripa, Salya, Kritavarman, Vinda, Anuvinda, Jayadratha, Chitrasena, Vikarna, and Durmarshana. They were all very good with their bows and arrows. They shot lots of arrows at Bhima. Salya shot nine, Kritavarman three, Kripa nine, Chitrasena, Vikarna and Bhagadatta each shot ten, Jayadratha three, and Vinda and Anuvinda each shot five.  Even Duryodhana, the Kaurava king, shot twenty arrows at Bhima!

Bhima was super strong! He didn't give up. He shot back at all of them! He shot Salya seven arrows, Kritavarman eight, and even broke Kripa's bow in half with an arrow!  Then he shot Kripa seven more times. He also shot Vinda and Anuvinda three arrows each, Durmarshana twenty, Chitrasena five, Vikarna ten, and Jayadratha five. He even shot Jayadratha's chariot driver and horses!  Jayadratha had to jump to another chariot!

Another warrior, Gautama, shot ten arrows at Bhima. Bhima was angry! He shot many arrows back at Gautama.

Then Bhima shot lots of arrows at all those kings who had attacked him.  They kept shooting arrows at each other!  Bhima shot Salya 80 arrows, and Salya shot Bhima back! Even Salya shot Bhima's chariot driver!  Bhima was very angry and shot Salya back. He shot many arrows at all the other kings.

Bhima was so strong, he stood tall and strong even when many arrows hit him, like a mountain in a rainstorm!  He kept fighting bravely!

Then Arjuna, Bhimaâ€™s brother, arrived with his friend Sikhandin to help!  Seeing the two Pandava brothers together, the enemy kings felt scared.  Arjuna and Bhima fought together, and more warriors came to fight them!  Even more fighting happened!  Duryodhana sent lots of soldiers to fight them.  Then a super big battle started between Arjuna and all the other warriors!
