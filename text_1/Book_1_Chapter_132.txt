Long ago, there was a powerful warrior named Drona. He was a friend of King Drupada.  Drona went to see King Drupada again.  He said, "King, I am your friend!"

But King Drupada was very rich and proud. He frowned. His eyes got red. He said, "You're not my friend anymore!  We were friends before, but things have changed.  Rich kings can't be friends with poor people like you.  Our friendship was only for a certain reason.  Friends have to be equal.  You're poor, and I'm rich. You're not a king, and I am. So we can't be friends."

Drona was very angry at the king's mean words. He thought for a second. Then he decided what to do. He left King Drupadaâ€™s kingdom and went to another kingdom, Hastinapur, the city of elephants.  He was going to show the king how wrong he was!
