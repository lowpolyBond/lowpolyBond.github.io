Once upon a time, the Pandava brothers – Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva – spent a night in a peaceful forest.  It was a special place where many holy people lived.  They talked about good and bad things, and listened to wise stories.  Instead of sleeping on comfy beds, the Pandavas slept on the ground next to their mother, Kunti. They ate food sent by King Dhritarashtra, their uncle.

The next morning, Yudhishthira, his brothers, his family, and his priest explored the forest.  They saw many places where people prayed to the gods.  There were beautiful altars with fire, flowers, and fruits.  Deer peacefully grazed, and birds sang sweetly.  The whole forest was full of happy sounds!

Yudhishthira gave the holy people gifts:  pots, blankets, and other things they needed. He gave away many things from the things he had brought.  They all gladly accepted these gifts.

After exploring, Yudhishthira went back to where King Dhritarashtra and his wife Gandhari were. He also saw his mother, Kunti, sitting nearby. He greeted them all politely.

Then, some important wise men came, including the very famous and wise Vyasa. Everyone stood up to greet them.  Vyasa sat on a special seat that had been prepared for him.  Then everyone else sat down too.  It was a very special and important day in the forest.
