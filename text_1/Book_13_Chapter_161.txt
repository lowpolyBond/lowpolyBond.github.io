King Yudhishthira, Vasudeva told a story about a very powerful god named Rudra.  He had many names!

Rudra is also called Mahadeva, the Great God. He's like fire and lightning, but also like gentle water and the moon.  Sometimes he's angry and fierce, like a roaring fire.  Other times he's kind and peaceful.

He has lots of different forms!  He’s one-eyed, three-eyed, even has eyes all over! He's even got a smoky body, so he's called Dhurjati. Because he protects everyone, he’s called Siva, which means “auspicious.”  He doesn't move from his place, so he’s called Sthanu.  He’s everywhere – past, present, future! That's why he's called Vahurupa, meaning “many forms.”

Rudra is the Lord of all creatures, Pasupati!  He’s the boss of all the other gods! He’s always watching over everyone.  People worship him in many ways, and he's very happy when they do.  He lives near burning places and helps souls move on. He’s even inside us all, like our breath!

Rudra is also the god of death, but he's also the god of life. He gives good things like health and happiness, but he can also take them away.  He's the reason some gods are powerful. He is everywhere, doing good and bad things all across the world. He’s super strong, and the whole universe is full of him! He's amazing, right?  He even roars like a giant sea horse!
