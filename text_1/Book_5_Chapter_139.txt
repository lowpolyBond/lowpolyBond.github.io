Duryodhana, the Kaurava prince, frowned.  He didn't say anything.  His uncles, Bhishma and Drona, the greatest warriors, looked at each other sadly.

Bhishma said, "It breaks our hearts to fight Yudhishthira. He's kind, honest, and wise. We shouldn't fight such a good man."

Drona sighed.  "I love Arjuna more than my own son! He's the greatest archer.  But because I'm a warrior, I must fight him.  It's terrible!  Arjuna is so skilled because I taught him.  Only bad people, liars, and those who don't respect the gods, fail. Good people always do what is right. The Pandavas, even though you've been unfair to them, still want peace.  You, Duryodhana, have made many bad choices.  Your uncles, Vidura, and Krishna have all warned you.  You have a huge army, but the Pandavas are strong too, like a river rushing into the ocean.  You’ve taken their good fortune, but they are still powerful. Even Kuvera, the king of riches, knows Yudhishthira is good. They’ve got their strength back.  We, Bhishma and Drona, have lived our lives well and have done all we needed to do. It's time for us to rest.  But you, Duryodhana, are about to lose everything – your kingdom, your friends, your life – if you go to war.  How can you win against Yudhishthira? Draupadi, his wife, prays for his victory.  He has Krishna, the wisest man, as his advisor, and Arjuna, the best warrior, as his brother.  He has many wise and brave friends. Make peace! Don't fight! Save your family, your kingdom, yourself!"
