Arjuna saw the Samsaptakas, bad guys who wouldn't stop fighting, come back to the battlefield.  He said to Krishna, his best friend and charioteer, "Let's go fight them! They won't live through this!"

Krishna smiled. He drove the chariot, pulled by beautiful white horses, super fast towards the enemy.  The chariot zoomed around like a magic flying car!

The Samsaptakas, angry and armed, attacked Arjuna.  They shot so many arrows that Arjuna and Krishna disappeared in a shower of arrows!

But Arjuna was strong! He got even angrier. He blew his powerful conch shell and fired a special arrow.  Suddenly, many copies of Arjuna and Krishna appeared! The Samsaptakas got confused. They thought, "Is that Arjuna? Is that Krishna?"  They were so confused they started fighting *each other*!

Arjuna’s special arrow killed many Samsaptakas.  He laughed and then quickly defeated more soldiers with his arrows.  The battlefield was filled with arrows.  The soldiers couldn't see Arjuna or Krishna anymore!  They thought they were dead and cheered.

But then Krishna, all sweaty and tired, called out, "Arjuna, where are you? Are you okay?"

Arjuna used another special arrow to clear away the rain of arrows.  A strong wind blew away the remaining Samsaptakas, their horses, elephants, and chariots – they looked like leaves blowing in the wind!

Arjuna kept fighting.  He shot many more arrows. He cut off heads, arms, and legs.  The battlefield was a mess of broken chariots and dead soldiers.  It looked like a terrible storm had hit!  The air was clear from all the blood.

Even after all this fighting, the Samsaptakas kept charging towards Arjuna, until they were all dead. The battlefield looked scary, like the land of the dead.


While Arjuna fought, another group of soldiers, led by Drona, attacked Yudhishthira.  A huge new battle began!
