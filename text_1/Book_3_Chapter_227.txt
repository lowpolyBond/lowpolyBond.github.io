Once upon a time, Markandeya told a story about Skanda, a powerful god.  A thunderbolt hit Skanda, and magically, lots of little boy and girl children were born! These children were strong and a little bit scary.  

They chose a new dad, Visakha.  Their dad, Bhadrasakha, looked like a goat!  He kept his children safe. That's why people call Skanda the father of all children.

If people want a baby boy, they pray to Rudra (like the fire god) and Uma (like Swaha).  Then, some girls who were the fire godâ€™s daughters asked Skanda for help. They wanted to be good mothers. Skanda said, "You will be!" He also said they'd be called Siva and Asiva.

These girls became seven amazing mothers. They had a super strong son named Sisu. He was known as the eighth hero. But if you count Bhadrasakha, the goat-faced god, then Sisu is the ninth!  Bhadrasakha had six faces; the goat face was right in the middle.  The mothers always looked at that special goat face.

All of this happened on the fifth day of a special month.  Then, on the sixth day, there was a HUGE battle!
