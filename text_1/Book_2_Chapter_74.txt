Bharata was furious! He yelled at his stepmother, Kaikeyi, "You're cruel and wicked! You have no goodness in you! Go live in the forest! I'm heartbroken!  You left my father, and you shouldn't mourn for him now. What did my father, the king, and my brother Rama ever do to you? You banished Rama and caused my father's death! You’ve done something terrible – worse than killing a priest!  You should be ashamed! You don't deserve to live where my father is! You've made me king, but everyone hates me because of what you did! You're not my mother, you're my enemy! You're a terrible person, Kaikeyi!"

Bharata cried and shouted about how Kaikeyi was mean to his mothers, Queen Kaushalya and Sumitra. He said she wasn't a good daughter to her own father, King Ashvapati. He said she was like a monster who destroyed his family. He blamed her for everything – his father's death, Rama's exile, and his own unhappiness. He said that Rama was a good man, and she had been very cruel.

Bharata then told a story.  A magical cow, Kamadhenu, had sons who worked hard.  She was so sad to see them tired and hurt that she cried.  Even the King of the Gods, Indra, noticed her tears! He asked her why she was so sad.

Kamadhenu explained that she loved her sons very much.  She was heartbroken to see them suffering.  Indra understood.  He knew how much mothers love their children.

Bharata said, "Just like Kamadhenu loved her sons, Kaushalya loved Rama!  You’ve hurt her so badly by sending Rama away.  You’ll never be happy! I will take care of my brother and bring him back.  Then I will go live in the forest myself.  You should die, Kaikeyi! Only when Rama is back will I be okay."

Bharata collapsed to the ground. He was so upset he looked like a fallen elephant, his clothes and jewelry scattered around him.  He was heartbroken and filled with anger.
