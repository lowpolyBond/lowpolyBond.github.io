King Indra, the mighty god, was sad.  He'd lost his power for a while.  But then, with the help of his friends – the fire god Agni, the wise teacher Vrihaspati, and many other gods – he got his power back!  He rode on Airavata, his giant elephant, and everyone cheered.  He even got a special blessing from a wise saint named Angiras.  Angiras became famous, and Indra ruled the world happily again.

Salya, a wise king, told Yudhishthira this story. He said, "Just like Indra fought and won, you will too! Your enemies, like the bad guy Vritra, will be defeated. You and your brothers will get your kingdom back, just like Indra got his." Salya told Yudhishthira that even Indra had hard times.  He had to hide to defeat his enemies.

Salya reminded Yudhishthira that even really strong people face difficulties.  Bad people like Karna and Duryodhana, who are mean and unfair, will be defeated.  Yudhishthira and his brothers will win and rule the land again, just like Indra.  He said listening to this story helps good people win.

Yudhishthira thanked Salya.  He knew Salya was going to be Karna's chariot driver, but asked Salya to help them instead by telling Karna about Arjuna's greatness.  Salya agreed to help. He said goodbye to Yudhishthira and his brothers and went to help the bad guys, even though he was secretly helping the good guys.
