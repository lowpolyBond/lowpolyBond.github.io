The sun rose, and the battle was about to begin!  The night before, everyone was shouting, "Get ready! Get ready!"  

Boooom!  The sound of trumpets and drums was like a lion's roar!  Neighing horses, rattling chariot wheels, and trumpeting elephants made a HUGE noise.  Soldiers shouted and cheered. It was super loud!

The Kauravas and Pandavas armies were ready. Their shiny armor sparkled in the sunlight.  Golden chariots looked like lightning in the clouds.  The lines of chariots looked like whole cities!  King Dhritarashtra, their father, looked bright and strong, like the full moon.

The soldiers were amazing! They held swords, spears, and other awesome weapons.  Lots of beautiful flags waved in the air. They were made of gold and jewels!  The soldiers were ready to fight.

Ten brave leaders led the Kauravas. There was Sakuni, Salya, Jayadratha, and many other strong warriors. Each leader commanded a huge army.  They were all ready to fight for Duryodhana. They looked strong and brave!

The Kauravas had eleven huge armies!  Bhishma, the grandfather, led one of them. He was so strong and brave. His white armor and white umbrella made him look like the moon among the clouds.  Even the bravest Pandava warriors felt scared when they saw Bhishma.

The Pandavas had seven huge armies.

The two armies faced each other. It was like two huge oceans filled with giant crocodiles and scary sea monsters!  It was the biggest battle anyone had ever seen!
