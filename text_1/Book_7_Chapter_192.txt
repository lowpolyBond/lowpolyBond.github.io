Once upon a time, during a great battle, a brave warrior named Dhrishtadyumna wanted to defeat the powerful Drona.  Dhrishtadyumna was very strong and had a special bow and arrow.  His arrow was so bright, it looked like the sun!  Everyone was scared when they saw it.

Drona, who was sad and worried, saw the arrow coming.  He tried to fight back, but his magic weapons wouldn't work anymore! He was tired from fighting for days.  He was also very sad because his son had died.

Drona got a new bow and arrows and fought back bravely. He shot many arrows at Dhrishtadyumna, breaking his bow.  Dhrishtadyumna smiled, got a new bow, and shot Drona.  Drona broke Dhrishtadyumna's new bow too, and shot him with many arrows!

Dhrishtadyumna used a special magic weapon. He mixed up his horses with Drona's horses!  Then, Drona broke Dhrishtadyumna's chariot, leaving him without a chariot, horses, or driver.  Dhrishtadyumna bravely picked up a club, but Drona broke it with arrows.

Dhrishtadyumna grabbed his sword and shield, and fought bravely!  He moved quickly around Drona's chariot, making it hard for Drona to hit him.  He was very skillful! Everyone watched in amazement.

Drona, very strong, shot many arrows at Dhrishtadyumna and broke his sword and shield.  He was about to hit Dhrishtadyumna with a powerful arrow, but another brave warrior named Satyaki saved him by shooting the arrow down with many arrows of his own!

Everyone was amazed by Satyaki's bravery.  They cheered loudly as he fought bravely against the powerful warriors.  The battle continued, but Satyaki's bravery showed everyone how courage could shine brightly even in the midst of a fierce war.
