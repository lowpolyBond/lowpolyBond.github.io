Krishna went to a very powerful god and goddess.  He bowed down and asked for some special wishes.  He wanted to be strong and brave, to be famous, and to have lots and lots of children!  The god, Shiva, said, "So be it!"

Then, the goddess, Uma, spoke. She said, "Krishna, you'll have a son named Samva. And you can choose eight more wishes!" Krishna asked for good things like kindness to the wise people, his dad's love, a hundred more sons, a happy family, his mom's love, peace, and to be clever.

Uma smiled and said, "You'll get all that!  You'll also have sixteen thousand wives, and everyone will love you very much. Your palace will be full of guests every day!"

Then, the god and goddess disappeared. Krishna told everything to his wise teacher, Upamanyu. Upamanyu was amazed. He said, "There's no god as great as Shiva.  He's the best!"
