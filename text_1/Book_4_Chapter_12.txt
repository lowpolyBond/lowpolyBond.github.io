Once upon a time, in the kingdom of King Virata, something amazing happened!  A very handsome young man arrived. He shone like the sun breaking through the clouds! He went straight to the king's horses and looked them over carefully.

King Virata saw him and said to his friends, "Wow! Look at that man! He's so strong and handsome! He knows a lot about horses, I think. Let's invite him to meet me!"

The young man went to the king and bowed.  "Greetings, your Majesty!" he said. "I'm very good with horses. I can take care of yours!"

King Virata said, "I'll give you a good home, lots of money, and the best care for my horses. But tell me, who are you? And where do you come from?"

The young man replied, "My name is Nakula. I'm one of the five Pandava brothers!  I used to look after my brother Yudhishthira's horses.  I'm the best horse trainer around! I can train any horse, heal any sick horse, and even tame the wildest mares!  My brother Yudhishthira used to call me Granthika."

King Virata was so happy! "You can take care of all my horses, right away!  All my other horse keepers will listen to you.  But you seem too important for this job! You look like a king yourself! You remind me of your brother Yudhishthira.  Tell me, how is Yudhishthira doing in the forest?"

King Virata treated Nakula with great respect. Nakula was so kind and helpful that everyone in the palace liked him.  No one knew he was a prince!  The Pandava brothers lived secretly in King Virata's kingdom, hiding their true identities.  Even though they were sad and missed their home, they were safe and patient, waiting for the right time to return.
