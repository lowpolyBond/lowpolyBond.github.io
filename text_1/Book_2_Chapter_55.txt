Rama and Lakshmana, two brave princes, stayed overnight and said goodbye to a wise old man.  The old man, like a kind father, told them how to get to Cittrakuta.

"Follow the river," he said, "until you see a broken boat.  Use a long stick and some pots to cross the river.  On the other side, you'll see a big, dark green fig tree.  Many magical people visit it. Pray there for what you wish for. Then, keep going.  A little further is Nilvan, a beautiful place with lots of trees. That's the way to Cittrakuta! I've traveled this path many times."

Rama and Lakshmana thanked the wise man and started their journey.  Sita, Rama's wife, walked ahead. They came to a fast-flowing river. They made a raft from bamboo and grass. Lakshmana made Sita a comfy seat.  Rama helped Sita onto the raft.  

In the middle of the river, Sita prayed, "Dear river, please help Rama keep his promise!  When I return, I'll give you many cows."

They reached the other side safely. They found the big fig tree. Sita bowed down and prayed, "Dear tree, please help Rama keep his promise, so I can see my family again!"

Rama told Lakshmana, "Take care of Sita.  She's very precious to me.  Find her any flowers or fruits she likes."

Sita walked between her brothers, like a queen elephant between two strong elephants. She saw many amazing things. Lakshmana brought her whatever she wanted. They saw pretty birds and animals.

Later, Lakshmana and Rama hunted some deer for food.  They found a cozy spot, and everyone felt safe and happy.
