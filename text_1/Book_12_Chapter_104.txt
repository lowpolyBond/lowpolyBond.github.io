Once upon a time, a good king named Yudhishthira was in trouble.  He’d lost his kingdom! His army was gone, his treasure was empty, and even his advisors had turned against him.  He was very sad. He asked a wise man, Bhishma, "How can a good king like me be happy when I have nothing?"

Bhishma said, "I'll tell you a story.  Long ago, there was a prince named Kshemadarsin. He also lost everything and felt very sad. He went to a wise sage named Kalakavrikshiya for help."

Prince Kshemadarsin said, "Wise sage, I’ve tried everything! What can I do?  Should I just give up?  I deserve to be a king and have wealth! I'm so unhappy!"

The wise sage replied, "You already know the answer.  Everything in this world changes.  Your kingdom, your riches – they’re all temporary, just like a dream.  Even you won't live forever. Your father and grandfather are gone, aren't they?  Wise people understand this. They don't get upset when things change."

The sage continued, "Think about it: everything disappears.  The things people had before us are gone, and the things we have now will be gone too.  Don't be sad about what's lost.  What use is sadness? It won't bring back what’s gone."

"You worry about losing things that might never have been yours in the first place. Look, many smart people live happily without kingdoms or wealth. They are not unhappy like you are.  Don't let sadness control you."

The king said, "My kingdom was given to me, and Time took it away. Now I depend on others for help."

The wise sage said, "Don't worry about the past or the future.  Enjoy what you have *now*.  Don't be jealous of others. It doesn’t matter if they have more than you.  A good person doesn’t complain to God when things get tough.  They keep a happy heart."

"Many people want wealth, but some lose everything trying to get it.  Others think wealth is everything, forgetting about everything else that matters. It is important to be happy with what you have.  Sometimes we lose things, and sometimes things lose us. A wise person isn’t sad when this happens."

The sage added, "Control your thoughts and words.  Don't let your feelings get the better of you.  You're a wise and strong person. Don't be sad about the past or afraid of the future.  Don't beg for things. That's not right for a noble man like you."

"Go live in the forest.  Eat fruits and roots. Be peaceful and kind to all living things.  Live simply and happily, surrounded by nature.  A wise person finds peace no matter what happens. Your kingdom is gone; that is the reality.  What good is it to worry about what you cannot get back? This is the way to be truly happy."
