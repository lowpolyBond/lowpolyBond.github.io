Once upon a time, after a big battle, King Dhritarashtra was very upset. His son, Duryodhana, had been hurt badly by Bhima.  He asked Sanjaya, "What did Baladeva, the strong warrior, say when he saw this?"

Sanjaya said, "Baladeva was furious! He shouted, 'That's not fair! Bhima hit Duryodhana below the belt! That's against the rules of fighting with a mace!'  He was so angry, he raised his plow to fight Bhima! But Krishna, another strong warrior, stopped him."

Krishna hugged Baladeva and explained, "Sometimes things happen that seem unfair.  The Pandavas (Bhima's brothers) are our friends, and they were treated very badly by Duryodhana.  Bhima promised to break Duryodhana's thighs, and even a wise man put a curse on Duryodhana!  So, it's not really Bhima's fault."

Baladeva listened. He said, "Following rules is important. But sometimes greed and pleasure make it hard. Bhima broke the rules, so it’s not quite right." Krishna said, "But the war is over!  Duryodhana was a bad person.  Let's not be angry anymore."

Even though Krishna talked to him, Baladeva was still sad. He said Duryodhana was a good warrior, and Bhima would be seen as unfair. Baladeva then left. Everyone was sad.

Later, Krishna went to Yudhishthira, the Pandava king. Krishna said, "Yudhishthira, why did you let Bhima hit Duryodhana's head with his foot after he was already dead? That’s not right!"

Yudhishthira said, "I know it wasn't nice, Krishna. But Duryodhana and his brothers were very mean to us. They cheated us and sent us to live in the forest. Bhima is still very angry about all the bad things they did. I didn’t stop him because of all that anger."

Krishna sighed and said, "Alright." He knew Bhima's anger was a big part of it.  Bhima was very happy he won. He told Yudhishthira, "The war is over!  Now you are the king!"

Yudhishthira said, "Yes, the war is over. Bhima, you have avenged our family. You won!"  Everyone was happy that the great battle was finally done.
