Once upon a time, a wise man named Markandeya told a story.  He said, "A great king asked a very smart woman named Saraswati, 'How can I be a good person and live a happy life?'"

Saraswati answered, "Study the holy books and be kind. If you do good things, you'll go to a beautiful place in the sky!  Imagine sparkling lakes filled with pretty flowers and fish. Good people live there, happy and surrounded by friends.

Giving gifts makes you even happier. Giving a cow to someone in need is like getting a ticket to a wonderful place in the sky!  Giving a bull helps too, and even giving clothes or gold is a good thing.  If you give a really nice cow, you'll live in the happy place for as long as the cow has hairs! Giving other things, like a strong bull or a special type of cow, is even better. It's like getting extra points!

The good deeds you do will also help your family, even your great-great-great-grandkids!  Even making a pretend cow out of seeds and giving it away is a great thing to do!

But doing bad things is like being lost at sea in a big storm.  Giving gifts to kind people saves you from that scary storm. Giving land or marrying off your daughter in a nice way also helps you live a good life.

And you know what else? If you keep a special fire burning for seven years, and pray to God every day, that makes your family good for many generations!"

Then the smart man, Tarkshya, said, "Please tell me more about this special fire! I want to keep it going forever!"
