Once upon a time, King Drupada held a big contest.  He wanted to find a husband for his daughter, Draupadi.  Lots of kings came to the contest.  But a wise man, a Brahmin, won!

The other kings were very angry.  "How dare he win!" they shouted.  "This Brahmin is not a king!  He's taking our place! Let's kill him and King Drupada!"

They were ready to fight!  But then, two strong brothers, Bhima and Arjuna, stepped forward.  Bhima was super strong! He ripped a huge tree out of the ground, showing how powerful he was. Arjuna, his brother, stood ready with his bow and arrow.

Another important person was there, Krishna.  He knew who Bhima and Arjuna were. He recognized them, along with their other brothers.  Krishna saw their older brother Yudhishthira, and he even thought he saw their cousins!  Krishna was very happy to see that they were safe. The kings were so scared of Bhima and Arjuna that they stopped fighting.


The story showed how strong and brave the Pandava brothers were, and how Krishna recognized them.  The angry kings were outsmarted by the strength and wisdom of the Pandavas and their protectors.
