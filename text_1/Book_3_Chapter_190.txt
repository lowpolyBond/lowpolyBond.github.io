Long ago, a wise man named Markandeya told a story about a hero named Kalki.  Kalki was very brave. He fought bad people and made the world safe again.

Kalki defeated all the thieves and robbers. Then, he gave the land to good people called Brahmins. He taught everyone to be good and kind. Kalki went to a beautiful forest, and everyone copied his good behavior.  The Brahmins helped make the world even better.  Everywhere, people were happy and safe.

Kalki wore simple clothes and carried a spear. He continued to fight bad people, even when they cried out for help.  After Kalki defeated the bad guys, a new time of peace began.  It was called the Krita Age.

In the Krita Age, everything was wonderful! There were pretty gardens, lots of food, and places to learn.  Everyone was kind and honest.  People helped each other and worshipped their gods. Farmers grew lots of yummy crops, and the kings were good rulers.  Everyone did their jobs well.

Markandeya explained that there are different ages, each with its own good and bad times. He told Yudhishthira, a king, how things would be in the future and how they had been in the past. Markandeya said that even the gods and goddesses couldn’t escape the changes in time.

Markandeya also gave Yudhishthira some important advice: Be kind to everyone, tell the truth, and control your anger.  Always protect your people.  Be humble and do good things.  Do your best to make the world a better place.

Yudhishthira promised to follow this advice.  He and his brothers were very happy to hear Markandeya’s wise words.  They felt hope for the future.  They knew that even in hard times, being good and kind is always the best way to live.
