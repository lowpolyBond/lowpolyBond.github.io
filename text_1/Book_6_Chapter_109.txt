Once upon a time, King Dhritarashtra asked his advisor, Sanjaya, "Tell me, how did the Pandavas' army fight against Bhishma?"

Sanjaya said, "The Pandavas marched to battle with loud music.  Sikhandin led their army.  He was protected by strong warriors like Bhima and Arjuna.  Behind them were other brave fighters, all ready to fight bravely.  The Kauravas, led by the powerful Bhishma, were also ready for battle.  He had his own strong warriors to protect him.  Drona, Bhagadatta, and many other kings were in his army, too."

The battle began!  The Pandavas and Kauravas fought hard.  Bhishma was very strong, and many Kaurava soldiers died fighting the Pandavas.  Then, Dhritarashtra asked, "What did Bhishma do when he saw his army losing?"

Sanjaya answered, "Bhishma was furious! He shot many arrows, knocking down elephants, horses, and soldiers. The Pandavas all attacked Bhishma at once, but he was still very strong. He fought like a storm!"

Everyone was amazed by Bhishma's strength.  Then, Sikhandin fought Bhishma.  Bhishma knew Sikhandin and said, "I won't fight you, Sikhandin." But Sikhandin was angry. He said, "I know you're a great warrior, Bhishma, but I have to fight you for the Pandavas! I will defeat you!"

Sikhandin shot many arrows at Bhishma.  Arjuna told Sikhandin, "I will help you defeat Bhishma! Fight bravely, and I'll protect you."  Arjuna helped Sikhandin, and together, they fought against Bhishma and many other Kaurava warriors.  They fought Drona, Kripa, and many other strong leaders.  Arjuna protected Sikhandin, while Sikhandin fought Bhishma.
