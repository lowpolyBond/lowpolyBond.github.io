Once upon a time, a wise man named Atri wanted to live peacefully in the forest. His wife thought he should ask King Vainya for lots of money first.  But Atri was worried. He’d heard from his friend Gautama that some of the king's advisors were jealous of him.

Atri finally decided to go anyway. He went to King Vainya's big ceremony and praised the king, saying he was the best ruler ever!

But Gautama, Atri’s friend, disagreed! He said that only the great god Indra was the best ruler.  Atri and Gautama argued about who was right.  Everyone at the ceremony heard them.

King Vainya asked what the fuss was about.  Another wise man, Kasyapa, helped to explain the argument.  They all went to a very, very wise man called Sanatkumara to find out the truth.

Sanatkumara explained that kings are very important. They protect people, make good laws, and keep the peace.  He said a king is like a sun that shines away bad things.  Kings are just as important as gods!

King Vainya was happy that Sanatkumara agreed with Atri. He gave Atri lots and lots of gold! Atri happily took the gold, gave some to his sons, and went to live peacefully in the forest.  He was happy to finally do what he wanted.
