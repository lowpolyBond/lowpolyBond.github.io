Once upon a time, King Yudhisthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, a very tricky question.  He wanted to know if it was wrong to teach someone from a lower social group.  Bhishma said, "It's a complicated question, my king, and I'll tell you a story."

Bhishma told a story about a special place in the mountains.  Many holy people lived there, praying and studying. One day, a kind Sudra (someone from a lower social group) came to the holy place. He wanted to learn how to be holy, too. He asked the leader of the holy people to teach him.

The leader said, "It's not right for a Sudra to live here and be holy like us.  You can stay and help us, though."

The Sudra was sad, but he decided to be holy anyway. He built a little hut nearby and lived a very simple life. He prayed a lot, gave food to anyone who visited, and was very kind.

One day, a wise holy man came to visit the Sudra.  The Sudra asked for help with a special prayer for his ancestors. The holy man showed him how, but the Sudra did it slightly wrong.

After a long time, the Sudra and the holy man died.  The Sudra was reborn as a king, and the holy man was reborn as a priest for the king.  Every day, the king laughed at his priest!

The priest was upset. He asked the king, "Why do you laugh at me?"

The king said, "Remember our last lives? You taught me a holy ritual, but you taught me wrong. Because of that mistake, you were reborn as a priest and I as a king. I laugh because I remember."

Bhishma finished his story. "So, my king," he said, "It’s not good for holy people to teach those from a lower social group. If the teaching is wrong, the teacher shares the bad results."  He explained that teaching should be done wisely and carefully, and teaching for money is never good.  It’s better to be quiet and avoid any mistakes.
