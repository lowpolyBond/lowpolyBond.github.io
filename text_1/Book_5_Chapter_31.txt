Yudhishthira, the Pandava prince, told Sanjaya, his messenger, "Sanjaya, everyone – good or bad, young or old, strong or weak – is guided by the Great Lord. He decides who is smart and who is silly!  Tell my uncle Dhritarashtra, the King, everything honestly.  Talk to everyone first, then tell him the truth."

"Go to the Kauravas (our cousins) and greet Dhritarashtra. Touch his feet and ask him how he is doing. Tell him we, the Pandavas, are happy, thanks to *his* strength and kindness. He gave us our kingdom, and he shouldn’t forget us now, or bad things will happen!  This kingdom is too big for just one person. Tell him we want to live peacefully with our cousins.  Don't let him let his enemies win!"

"Then bow to Bhishma, our grandfather. Tell him he saved our family a long time ago, and now he should help us all live together in peace. Tell Vidura, the wise advisor, to ask for peace for us.  Tell Duryodhana, our cousin, that we forgive him for everything bad he did, even dragging Draupadi (our sister-in-law) into court, and making us live in the forest. We're strong enough to fight back, but we don't want to hurt our family.  We just want a fair share of the kingdom.  Even just a small part – five villages – would be enough for us. We only want peace."

"Tell him we can choose five areas: Kusasthala, Vrikasthala, Makandi, Varanavata, and one more of his choosing.  Just give us a small bit! Let's all be brothers and friends again.  Let the Panchalas (our allies) laugh and play with the Kauravas. I want everyone to be safe and happy. Let’s all have cheerful hearts and make peace! I am ready for peace or war, to be rich or good, to be kind or strong. I can do anything."
