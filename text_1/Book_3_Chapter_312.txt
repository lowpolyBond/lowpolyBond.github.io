Once upon a time, the five Pandava brothers were very hungry and thirsty.  They were lost and tired.  Suddenly, a magical being appeared! He was a Yaksha, a powerful nature spirit, standing on one leg in a pond.

The Yaksha had a test for Yudhishthira, the oldest Pandava brother.  Yudhishthira was amazed. "Who are you?" he asked. "Are you a god? You look so powerful!"

The Yaksha smiled. "I am your father, Dharma, the god of justice!" he said.  "I tested you to see how good you are.  You passed!"

The Yaksha was very happy. He offered Yudhishthira three wishes.  Yudhishthira's first wish was for a poor priest.  A deer had run off with the priestâ€™s sacred fire sticks.  "Please help the priest," he wished.

The Yaksha chuckled. "It was me, in the form of a deer! I wanted to see if you were kind."  He gave Yudhishthira his first wish.  The priest got his fire sticks back!

For his second wish, Yudhishthira asked to be hidden for a whole year.  He and his brothers were hiding from their enemies.  The Yaksha granted this wish too.

For his third wish, Yudhishthira didn't ask for anything special. He simply asked to always be kind, honest, and brave.

The Yaksha was pleased. "You already have those qualities, my son," he said.  Then, poof!  The Yaksha disappeared.

The Pandavas felt refreshed and happy. They returned home, gave back the fire sticks, and were safe thanks to their father, Dharma.

The story teaches us that being good and honest is the greatest magic of all! If you remember this story, you will always be kind and good. And that makes you very powerful, too!
