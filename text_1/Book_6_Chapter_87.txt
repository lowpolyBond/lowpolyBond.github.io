Once upon a time, during a big battle, Yudhishthira's brother, Chitrasena, lost his chariot.  His other brother, Vikarna, quickly helped him into his own chariot.  Things were very dangerous!  The powerful warrior Bhishma was attacking Yudhishthira! Everyone thought Yudhishthira was going to die.

But Yudhishthira, with his brothers, bravely fought back! He shot thousands of arrows at Bhishma, covering him like clouds cover the sun. Bhishma shot back even more arrows!  They were like a swarm of bees! In a blink of an eye, Bhishma almost made Yudhishthira disappear with his arrows!

Yudhishthira, angry now, shot a huge arrow at Bhishma.  It was like a poisonous snake! But Bhishma was too fast! He cut the arrow in half with his own arrow before it could hit him. Then Bhishma destroyed Yudhishthira's chariot by killing his horses.

Yudhishthira quickly jumped onto his brother Nakula's chariot.  Bhishma, still furious, attacked Nakula and Sahadeva with lots and lots of arrows!  Yudhishthira knew he had to stop Bhishma. He told all his friends, "Let's attack Bhishma together!"

Everyone surrounded Bhishma.  He fought like a brave lion surrounded by deer! He was so strong he made everyone afraid, like a lion makes other animals afraid. He knocked down many warriors.  The battle was so crazy that the armies got all mixed up.

Then, a warrior named Sikhandin attacked Bhishma.  Bhishma didn't want to fight Sikhandin, so he fought other soldiers.  This made Yudhishthira's army very happy!  They shouted and blew their horns!  The battle raged on.  Brave warriors like Dhrishtadyumna and Satyaki fought hard.  Even when many soldiers fell, they didn't give up!

Two brave warriors, Vinda and Anuvinda, attacked Satyaki and knocked him off his chariot.  Satyaki hopped into another chariot quickly.  Yudhishthira attacked Vinda and Anuvinda, and Arjun fought like a storm! Drona fought for the other side, too.

The battle went on until the sun turned red.  Duryodhana told his army to fight harder.  But as the sun went down, the battlefield became scary.  It was dark, and there was blood everywhere.  Jackals howled, and scary ghosts appeared.

Arjun and Yudhishthira, and all the other soldiers went back to their camps. Duryodhana and his army went back too, still protecting Bhishma.  Everyone rested.  They took out their arrows, bathed, and even sang songs and played music.  For a little while, it felt like heaven.  But everyone knew the battle would start again soon.
