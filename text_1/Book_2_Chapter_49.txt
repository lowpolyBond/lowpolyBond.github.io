Rama remembered his father's words. He traveled all night.  When the sun came up, he kept going.  Soon, he reached the edge of his kingdom.

He saw beautiful fields and forests.  Pretty flowers were on the trees. His fast horses carried him along.  He heard villagers talking sadly.  "King Dasaratha is a bad king," they whispered. "Kaikeyi is mean! She sent Rama away!  How will Sita, the princess, live in the forest?  Rama is so good, he deserves better!"

Rama felt sad, but he kept going. He crossed a river. Then he crossed another river, where cows were grazing.  Peacocks and ducks chattered by the next river.  Rama showed Sita a big, open land.

Rama spoke kindly to Sumantra, his charioteer.  "Oh, Sumantra," he said, "when will I return home? When will I play in the Sarayu forest with my family again?  Kings and wise people love hunting. I'll hunt when my time in the forest is over."

Rama continued his journey, talking happily to Sumantra. He was strong and brave, and ready to do what he had to do.
