King Yudhishthira asked Bhishma, a wise old warrior, about people who chant sacred sounds.  "Bhishma," he said, "you said chanting leads to a good ending. Is that the only ending, or are there others?"

Bhishma replied, "Listen carefully, my king!  Chanting can lead to good things, but it can also lead to bad things, like going to a place called hell.  If someone chants without following the rules properly, or gives up before finishing, they might go to hell.

If they chant without believing in what they’re doing, or without enjoying it, or with pride, they also might go to hell.  If they are mean to others while chanting, that's bad too.  If they chant only to get something they want – like money or a wife – they might get that thing, but it might not be good for them. If they chant with a bad heart or don’t think clearly, they’ll have bad things happen.  Even if they try really hard but don't truly understand what they are doing, they still might end up in hell.

If someone chants and learns all about the greatest and most powerful thing in the universe – a thing you can't even describe – why would they still have to be born again later?" Yudhishthira asked.

Bhishma said, "Even if they learn about this great thing, if they don't truly understand it, they can still make mistakes and end up in a bad place. Chanting is good, but people make mistakes, and those mistakes can have bad consequences.”
