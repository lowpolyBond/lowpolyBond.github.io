The sun rose, shining bright and golden.  The battle started again!  Soldiers fought soldiers. Horse riders fought chariot riders. Elephants fought everyone!  Some fought in groups, others fought alone.

Many soldiers were tired and hungry. They were very thirsty.  The battle was loud!  Conch shells blew. Drums beat. Elephants roared. Bows twanged.  Soldiers shouted.  Horses neighed. Chariots rumbled. The noise was HUGE!  It went all the way up to the sky!

Soldiers groaned and cried out in pain.  So many were hurt and dying.  Swords were everywhere, like piles of clothes at the laundry.  The clash of swords sounded like clothes being beaten.  It was a terrible battle.  So much blood flowed, it looked like a river running to a land far away.  The river was made of blood, weapons, and the cries of the hurt.

Elephants and horses were tired too.  They couldn't move.  The battlefield was so full of dead animals and people, it was hard to find a path.  Even strong horses struggled to pull their chariots.  The whole army was scared, except for two great warriors: Drona and Arjuna.  They were like heroes, protecting their sides.  Everyone else fought them, then went to the land of the dead.

The battle was a big cloud of dust.  You couldn't see anything!  Friends and enemies fought each other. The dust cleared, showing blood everywhere.  The soldiers looked like beautiful trees in a magical forest.

Duryodhana, Karna, Drona, and Duhsasana fought against four Pandava warriors.  It was a super amazing fight! Everyone watched these amazing warriors battle, throwing arrows like rain.  They were strong and angry.  But not everyone died at once.  

The battlefield was a mess! Broken chariots, dead elephants, arrows, swords, and armor lay everywhere. It looked like a sky full of stars.

Then, Duryodhana fought Nakula.  Nakula was brave, shooting many arrows.  Everyone cheered for him!  Duryodhana fought back hard, pushing Nakula back. The army cheered for Duryodhana too!  Nakula then told Duryodhana to stop and think about all the bad things he had done.
