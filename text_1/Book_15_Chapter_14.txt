King Dhritarashtra was very sad.  His sons and many friends had died in a big war.  His wise advisor, Vidura, said, "King, you should make a big gift-giving ceremony.  This will help your loved ones in the afterlife."

Dhritarashtra was happy with this idea. He asked Yudhishthira, the good king, to help.  Yudhishthira called many wise priests and holy men.  He prepared tons of food, beautiful clothes, jewels, gold, many animals like sheep and goats, even villages and fields! He also got many horses, elephants, and even beautiful girls.

Yudhishthira and the king gave these gifts to remember everyone who had died:  Bhishma, Drona, Duryodhana, and all their friends.  They gave gifts to everyone, even more than they had planned.  If someone was supposed to get one hundred things, they got a thousand! It was a huge party!

It was like a giant cloud pouring down riches on the people!  So much food and drink flowed, like a big ocean filled with treasures. The music was loud and dancers performed.  They celebrated for ten whole days! Dhritarashtra gave away so many gifts that he felt happy. He knew his sons, grandsons, and even himself and his wife Gandhari would have a good place in the afterlife. Finally, he stopped giving gifts because he was very tired.  He was happy that he had done this special ceremony.
