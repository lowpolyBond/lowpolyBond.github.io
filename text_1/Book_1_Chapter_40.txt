Once upon a time, there was a very big, strong holy man named Jaratkaru.  He was so big, his name even meant "huge waste," because he got smaller and smaller through his prayers and hard work.  He was so busy being holy, he didn't want a wife.

Now, there was a king named Parikshit, who was a great hunter.  One day, he was chasing a deer deep in the forest. He got tired and thirsty. He found a holy man sitting in a cow shed, drinking milk from a calf.  Parikshit asked the holy man if he'd seen his deer.  The holy man was quiet; he didn't answer.

Parikshit was angry. He picked up a dead snake and put it on the holy man's shoulder! Then he went home.  He didn't know the quiet man was a very important holy person.

The holy man had a son named Sringin.  Sringin was very serious and worked hard at being holy, too.  One day, his friend Krisa teased him, saying, "Your father's carrying a dead snake!"  Sringin got very, very angry.  Krisa was sorry he had made Sringin so mad.

Later, we will hear about Astika, who was a very special baby.  But first, let's hear what happened next to Sringin and his angry feelings!
