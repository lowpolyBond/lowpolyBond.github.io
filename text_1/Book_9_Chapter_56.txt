King Dhritarashtra was very sad. His son, Duryodhana, was a great king. He ruled a huge kingdom.  But now, Duryodhana was fighting on foot, carrying only a big club! Dhritarashtra cried, "It's all fate! My poor son!"

Duryodhana, though, was happy and excited. He roared like a strong bull, challenging Bhima to a fight!

Suddenly, the weather turned scary.  Strong winds howled. Dust flew everywhere. It got very dark.  Thunder boomed!  Shooting stars fell from the sky. The sun disappeared! The ground shook.  Wild animals ran around, and scary jackals howled.  It was very, very frightening!

Bhima, seeing all these scary signs, told his brother Yudhishthira, "This Duryodhana is no match for me! I've been angry for a long time, and I'll finally get my revenge!  I'll defeat him and make you proud!"

Bhima was angry about many things.  Duryodhana had been mean. He had cheated them out of their kingdom, tricked them, and even tried to kill them! Bhima yelled, "I will break Duryodhana into a hundred pieces! I will pay him back for everything heâ€™s done!"

Duryodhana, too, was ready to fight. He said, "Stop talking, and let's fight! I've been waiting for this!"

Everyone cheered.  Bhima raised his big club and charged at Duryodhana.  The elephants trumpeted, and the horses neighed. The Pandavas' weapons shone brightly.  The great battle was about to begin!
