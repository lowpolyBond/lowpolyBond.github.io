Once upon a time, in the land of Kuru, a big meeting was happening.  Vidura, a wise man, had just spoken.  Then, Krishna, a very strong and powerful hero, spoke to Duryodhana, a mean prince.

Krishna said, "Duryodhana, you think you can trick me!  You think I'm alone.  But you are wrong!  The Pandavas, my friends, are all here.  Many mighty gods and powerful saints are here too!"

Krishna laughed a booming laugh.  Suddenly, from his body, thousands of tiny gods appeared! They shone like lightning!  Brahma was on his forehead, Rudra on his chest!  Powerful gods and heroes came out of every part of him!  Arjuna, his best friend, stood with his bow.  Bhima, Yudhishthira, and many more warriors stood ready to fight!  Krishna held every kind of weapon you could imagine.

Everyone was scared, except for a few wise people like Bhishma, Drona and Vidura.  The earth shook!  Flowers rained from the sky!  It was an amazing sight!

Then, Krishna calmed down. His awesome form disappeared.  He went away with his friends.  The Kauravas, the bad guys, tried to follow him.

Krishna didn't even look back. He got into his beautiful white chariot, which was fast and shiny.  King Dhritarashtra, Duryodhana's father, called out to him.  The king said, "Krishna, you saw how I tried to make peace! I tried to stop my sons from being mean!"

Krishna listened. Then, he told everyone, "You all saw what happened. Duryodhana was angry and rude.  The king is trying to help, but he can't control his sons."

Krishna bowed to everyone and drove away in his chariot. Bhishma, Drona, and Kripa, three great warriors, followed Krishna because they respected him.  Krishna went to visit his aunt, Kunti.  That was quite an exciting day!
