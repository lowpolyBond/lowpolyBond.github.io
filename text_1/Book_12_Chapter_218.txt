King Janaka of Mithila was a very wise ruler.  He wanted to know how to be truly happy, even after he died. He asked Bhishma, a great warrior, how Janaka, his ancestor, had achieved this.

Bhishma told a story about Janadeva, a king from Janaka's family. Janadeva had many teachers who taught him about life and the soul. But he wasn't fully satisfied.

Then, a very wise and holy man named Panchasikha arrived. Panchasikha had learned from many great teachers and knew all about the soul and how to live a good life.  He didn't worry about being happy or sad; he was always calm.

Panchasikha taught Janadeva that life is full of sadness.  Being born, doing things, and everything we do brings some sorrow.  Even being rich or powerful doesn't stop sadness.

Some people believed that the soul dies with the body. But Panchasikha explained that wasn't true.  He used examples: a seed grows into a plant, milk comes from a cow, and fire can be made in many ways. Just like these things, our bodies create our minds and thoughts.  Even after we die, something stays. Our bodies might go away, but the soul continues.

Other people believed that we are reborn again and again.  But Panchasikha showed that this idea also had problems. If we're always reborn as someone else, what's the point of being good or bad? Our actions wouldn't matter.

Panchasikha showed Janadeva that the best way to be truly happy is to understand this. Donâ€™t get attached to things like your body or possessions because they will all go away.  He stressed that focusing on the soul and letting go of worldly things would bring true peace.

Janadeva listened carefully. He was amazed by Panchasikha's wisdom. He decided to learn from this amazing teacher.  He gave up his other teachers and only followed Panchasikha.  The story shows how understanding the soul and letting go of attachments can bring true peace and happiness.
