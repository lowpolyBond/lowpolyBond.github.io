Once upon a time, a powerful demon king named Ilwala lived in a faraway land.  One day, some important kings and wise holy men came to visit.  Ilwala was very polite. He offered them a delicious meal.  The meat came from his brother, Vatapi, who could change into a ram!

But the holy men felt worried when they saw the cooked ram.  The wisest of them all, Agastya, said, "Don't worry! I'll eat it!" He ate the whole ram.  Then Ilwala called for his brother, Vatapi, to come out.  But only wind came out of Agastya's tummy â€“ *whoosh!*  Agastya laughed, "He can't come out! I ate him!"

Ilwala was very sad. He asked the holy men, "Why did you come? What do you want?" Agastya smiled. "We know you're rich.  These kings need help, and I need some wealth, too.  Give us what you can."

Ilwala offered to give each king lots of cows and gold coins.  He also planned to give Agastya even more, plus a beautiful golden chariot and fast horses. Agastya already knew all this! He had magical powers. Ilwala, feeling ashamed, gave everything away.  The magic horses quickly took everyone to Agastya's home.

Agastya used the wealth to make his wife, Lopamudra, happy. She asked him to have a special son.  Agastya asked her, "Would you like a thousand sons?  Or one hundred strong sons? Or ten very strong sons? Or just one son as strong as a thousand?" Lopamudra chose one super strong son.

After seven years, their son, Dridhasyu, was born. He was very smart and strong, even as a baby! He carried wood for his father and was called Idhmavaha (wood carrier).  Agastya was very proud.

This is why Agastya's home became famous.  A beautiful river, the Bhagirathi, flowed nearby.  Lomasa told this story to the great king Yudhishthira.  He said bathing in the river would make Yudhishthira strong again!  Yudhishthira and his brothers bathed and became very strong.

Yudhishthira asked about another hero named Rama, who lost his strength. Lomasa explained.  There were two Ramas. One was Rama, the son of King Dasaratha, who was actually the god Vishnu in disguise. The other was Rama, a very powerful holy man.  The holy man Rama challenged Dasaratha's Rama to string a magical bow.  Dasaratha's Rama did it so easily that the holy man lost his strength!  The holy man later regained his strength by bathing in a special river.  Just like Yudhishthira did.
