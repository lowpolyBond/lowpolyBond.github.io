Princess Sita, Rama's beautiful wife, was asked to stay behind in the palace.  But Sita said, "Rama, that's silly!  A wife always goes where her husband goes.  I'm part of you!  Your father's orders are also my orders. I'm coming with you!"

She explained, "My happiness depends on you, Rama.  Not my family.  I want to be with you, always. I'll walk ahead of you in the forest, clearing away any thorns or tall grass."

Sita continued, "I don't care about palaces or magic powers.  Being with you is the best thing ever! My father taught me how to be a good wife, and being your wife means being with you, even in a forest full of scary bears and wild bulls!"

"I'll be happy eating fruits and roots with you.  You can protect me. I'm not scared. I want to see the beautiful lakes and mountains with you. We can swim together and watch the pretty birds!"

Sita pleaded,  "Being with you in the forest is better than living in a palace, even better than heaven!  Without you, I don't want anything. Please, please take me!"

Rama loved Sita very much. But he didnâ€™t want her to suffer in the forest. He tried to explain how difficult life in the forest would be.
