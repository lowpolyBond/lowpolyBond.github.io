Once upon a time, in the land of Bharat, a messenger named Uluka came to the Pandavas. He brought a mean message from Duryodhana, the Kaurava prince.  Uluka’s words were like stings from a poisonous snake! They angered the Pandavas very much.

Arjuna, Bhima, and the other Pandavas were furious. Their eyes flashed. They looked like angry snakes. Bhima, breathing hard, glared at Krishna.

Krishna, the clever one, smiled. He told Uluka, "Go back to Duryodhana. Tell him we heard his message."

But Uluka, being naughty, repeated Duryodhana's mean words again! This made Arjuna even angrier.  He wiped the sweat from his forehead. The other kings watched, shocked.

Bhima couldn't stand it anymore! He roared at Uluka. "You fool! Your words were meant to make us mad. But listen to me, and take *my* words to Duryodhana!  I vow to kill you and your brothers tomorrow!"  Bhima was so angry, he gnashed his teeth.

Sahadeva, Bhima's brother, was also angry. He said, "You are a bad person, Uluka! Because of your father, Duryodhana, this fight even started!  I will kill you first, then I will kill Sakuni!"

Arjuna, however, was calm. He told Bhima, "Don't waste your anger on messengers. They only say what they are told. Tomorrow, I will answer Duryodhana with my arrows – from my Gandiva bow!"

King Yudhishthira spoke calmly to Uluka.  He said, “No good king ignores insults.  Go back and tell Duryodhana this:  If you are a real warrior, fight us yourself! Don't hide behind others!”

Krishna also had a message for Duryodhana. He said, "Tomorrow, you will face the battle. Don't think I won't fight because I am Arjuna's charioteer. My anger is like a fire, and it could burn you all!  But, first, Arjuna will answer your words with his bow."

Everyone listened to these powerful words.  The stage was set for a great battle.
