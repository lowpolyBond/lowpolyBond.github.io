King Dhritarashtra asked his friend Sanjaya, "Sanjaya, tell me about the different lands and mountains, and the people who live there!"

Sanjaya said, "South of Sweta and north of Nishadha is Romanaka.  The people there have beautiful white skin and are very happy. They have no enemies and live for 11,500 years!"

"South of Nishadha is Hiranmaya, with the Hiranwati River.  Garuda, the great bird, lives there! The people are rich and friendly, very strong, and live for 12,500 years."

"The Sringavat mountains have three amazing peaks! One is made of jewels.  Another is a beautiful palace where Sandili, a shining lady, lives."

"North of Sringavat, near the ocean, is Airavat. This land is special because of its jeweled mountain. The sun isn't hot there, and people don't get old. The moon and stars shine brightly. The people are beautiful like lotuses, and they smell sweet. They don't need to eat and they are very peaceful. They came from heaven and are very good. They live for 13,000 years!"

"Beyond the ocean, Lord Hari lives in a golden chariot. It has eight wheels and magical creatures. It's fast like a thought, and shines like fire. He is the Lord of everything. Everything comes from him, and everything goes back to him. He is earth, water, air, fire, and sky. He is everywhere!"

King Dhritarashtra thought about his sons.  He said, "Sanjaya, time destroys and creates everything. Nothing lasts forever. Nara and Narayana, very powerful gods, control everything.  The gods call him Vaikuntha, and we call him Vishnu!"
