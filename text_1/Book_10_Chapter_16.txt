Long ago, during a big war, a bad man named Ashvatthama wanted to hurt the Pandavas.  He threw a magic weapon at the unborn babies of the Pandava women!

Krishna, a very powerful and good person, knew what Ashvatthama had done.  He told Ashvatthama, "A wise man said the Pandavas would have a son named Parikshit."

Ashvatthama was angry. He said, "No! My weapon will kill the baby!"  He threw his magic weapon.

But Krishna was even more powerful!  He said, "The baby will die, but he will come back to life and live a long, long time!  You, Ashvatthama, are a bad person who hurts children. You will be punished! For 3,000 years, you will wander alone and sick, with no friends, and smelling bad."

Parikshit, the baby, did come back to life! He grew up strong and brave, and became a great king. He ruled for many years.

Ashvatthama, feeling sad and ashamed, gave the Pandavas a special magical jewel. He went away to live alone in the forest.

The Pandavas were happy their baby was safe. They gave the jewel to Draupadi, the Pandavas' wife.  She was very sad because Ashvatthama had killed her unborn sons.  But she was also brave.

Draupadi decided to forgive Ashvatthama because he was a brahmin (a holy man) and the son of their teacher. She told the king to put the jewel on his head. The king did, and he looked very handsome!

Draupadi stopped being sad.  Everyone was relieved that the war was finally over.  They had defeated their enemies but also shown mercy.
