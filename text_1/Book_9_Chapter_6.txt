After Karna died, Duryodhana's army was scared.  They were hiding in the mountains.  That night, lots of important warriors like Ashwatthama, Kripa, and Shalya were together. They needed a new leader.

Ashwatthama was amazing! He was strong, handsome, and very, very smart.  He was like a superhero. He knew everything about fighting and magic.  He was even more special because he wasn't born like other people.  Duryodhana asked Ashwatthama, "Who should be our new leader?"

Ashwatthama said, "Shalya! He's brave, strong, and famous.  He's like a god of war!"

Everyone agreed. They all cheered for Shalya.  Duryodhana got out of his chariot and asked Shalya to be their leader.  He said, "Shalya, be our general!  When you fight, the Pandavas will be afraid!"

Shalya said, "Of course! I'll do anything for you! My life, my kingdom, everything is yours!"

Duryodhana was happy. He said, "Shalya, be our leader, like Kartikeya led the gods to victory! Defeat the Pandavas!"  Shalya promised he would.  Everyone was ready for another big battle!
