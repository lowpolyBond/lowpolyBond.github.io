Arjuna, the brave warrior, had just won a big battle!  He looked around at his soldiers.  He saw some fighting bravely, and some celebrating their victories. He wanted to see his brother, King Yudhishthira.

But Arjuna couldn't find him! He asked his strong brother, Bhima, "Where is the King?"

Bhima said, "Karna hurt the King badly with his arrows! I'm not sure if he's even alive!"

Arjuna was worried. "Bhima," he said, "go find the King! He's probably back at camp. He fought bravely against Drona, even after getting hurt! But Karna hurt him even worse today!"

Bhima said, "I can't leave! There are many strong enemy soldiers here, called Samsaptakas!  If I leave, everyone will think I'm scared!"

Arjuna said, "I can't leave either! The Samsaptakas are in front of me!  I need to fight them first!"

Bhima replied, "I'll fight the Samsaptakas! You go find the King!"

Arjuna, still worried, asked his friend Krishna to help.  "Krishna," he said, "drive the chariot! I need to see the King!"

Krishna said, "Bhima, you stay here and fight! This is my job."

Krishna drove the chariot super fast!  They reached Yudhishthira, who was lying down, hurt but alive.  Arjuna and Krishna were so happy to see him safe! They bowed down to him.

The King was happy to see them too.  He thought Karna was dead, so he was very joyful!  He thanked Arjuna and Krishna. They were all happy the King was okay!
