Once upon a time, after Arjuna, the strongest warrior, went away to get powerful weapons, his brothers were very sad. They were living in the forest with Krishna, their friend.

Bhima, the strongest brother, was especially upset.  He said to Yudhishthira, their king, "Arjuna is the reason we're still alive! Without him, we'll all die!  We should fight the Kauravas (their enemies) now, before they get even stronger. We can win! We are brave and strong, and Krishna is with us.  But because of your bad luck at gambling, weâ€™re hiding in the forest!  This isn't right for a king. Kings should rule, not hide!"

Yudhishthira, though sad, said, "Bhima, we promised to stay hidden for a year.  We can't break our promise. We must wait until Arjuna comes back."

Just then, a wise holy man named Vrihadaswa arrived. Yudhishthira told him how sad he was. He missed Arjuna, he missed his kingdom, and he felt very unlucky because of the gambling game he lost.  He said, "I'm the unluckiest king ever!"

Vrihadaswa said, "Oh, King Yudhishthira, you think you're unlucky? Let me tell you about King Nala. *He* was really unlucky!"

Yudhishthira was curious. "Tell me about King Nala," he said.  And so, Vrihadaswa began to tell the story of King Nala, a story even sadder than Yudhishthira's own.
