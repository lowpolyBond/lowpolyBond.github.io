Once upon a time, a princess named Jaratkaru was married to a very holy man.  After he left, Jaratkaru went to see her brother, Vasuki, the king of the snakes.  She was very upset.

Vasuki was sad too.  He explained, "Jaratkaru, you were given to this holy man for a special reason.  A long time ago, a great god said that if you have a son, he will save our snake family from a terrible danger. Did the holy man say anything about a baby?"

Jaratkaru told her brother, "He said, 'There is...' and then he left. He never lies, so I think it means a baby is coming!"

Vasuki was so happy! He hugged his sister and gave her lots of presents.  Soon, Jaratkaru had a baby boy!  He was bright and strong, like the sun.

The little boy grew up in the snake king's palace. He was very smart and learned a lot from a wise teacher. He was a very good boy, always kind and thoughtful.  Everyone loved him.  They named him Astika, because his father had only said "There is" when he was still in his mother's tummy. Astika grew into a strong and wonderful young man, just like the great god Shiva!
