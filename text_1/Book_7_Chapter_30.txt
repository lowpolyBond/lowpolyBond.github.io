Once upon a time, in a great battle, Bhima, a strong Pandava warrior, was in trouble!  Lots of enemy warriors attacked him.

First, he fought back! He shot sixty arrows at Valhika and ten at Karna.  But then Drona, a powerful warrior, attacked Bhima!  He hit Bhima with many sharp arrows, then even more!  Karna added twelve arrows, Aswatthaman seven, and Duryodhana six.  Ouch!

Bhima was brave. He fought back hard, shooting fifty arrows at Drona, ten at Karna, and twelve at Duryodhana!  He shouted loudly as he fought.

Bhima's friends saw he was in danger.  The twins, Nakula and Sahadeva, and Yuyudhana rushed to help. Together, they attacked Drona's army.  It was a huge, messy battle!

The battlefield was crazy!  Horses fought horses, chariots crashed into chariots. Swords clashed, and arrows flew everywhere. Elephants fought elephants, some falling down with their riders.  Soldiers were trampled by elephants.

It was a terrible mess. Fathers fought sons, sons fought fathers. Chariots broke, flags tore, and brave warriors fell.  You could hear people shouting, "Father! Son! Friend! Help!" Blood and dust filled the air.

Even friends fought friends by mistake!  Some warriors fought so close they used their clubs to bash each other's heads. They pulled each other's hair and fought with their fists and teeth. Some lost arms; others lost their lives.  Even huge elephants fell, like giant islands in a river.

The battle raged on.  Then, Arjuna, another mighty Pandava warrior, arrived! He was like the sun, so strong and bright. He shot thousands of arrows, making the enemy army run and scream!  He only fought warriors who were still fighting, not those who had fallen or were running away.

The Kaurava soldiers called for help from Karna, another strong warrior. Karna fought back against Arjuna, using powerful fire weapons.  But Arjuna was strong too, and he kept fighting.

Bhima jumped down from his chariot and fought with his sword, killing many.  Dhrishtadyumna, another Pandava warrior, also fought bravely.  He and others fought so hard they almost defeated Karna.  Duryodhana, Drona, and Jayadratha saved him.

The fighting continued.  Soldiers, horses, elephants, and chariots crashed together. It was a terrible, chaotic battle, with many, many deaths. 

Finally, the sun set, and the tired warriors stopped fighting. It was the end of one day of that terrible war.
