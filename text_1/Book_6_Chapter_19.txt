King Dhritarashtra was amazed.  "Sanjaya," he said, "the Kauravas have a HUGE army!  Yudhishthira's army is much smaller. How will he fight?"

Sanjaya replied, "King Yudhishthira is wise. He told his brother Arjuna, 'We have fewer soldiers.  We need a special battle plan, a strong formation.'

Arjuna said, "I'll use the Vajra formation!  It's super strong, like a thunderbolt! Bhima, our strongest warrior, will lead the charge. He's so scary, even the enemy will run away!  Everyone will hide behind him, like hiding behind a big wall."

Arjuna put the army in the Vajra formation. Bhima was in front, a giant warrior.  Nakula, Sahadeva, and other brave heroes were with him.  King Virata and his army protected them from behind. Draupadi's sons and Abhimanyu were there too, protecting Bhima. Dhrishtadyumna and brave warriors protected them all.  Sikhandin fought behind Arjuna, and Arjuna was the strongest protector of all. Yudhishthira stayed in the middle of the army.  Giant elephants were all around him.  The army was so strong it was like a river, impossible to stop!

Arjuna explained to Yudhishthira how strong Bhima was and how he inspired everyone.  The whole army cheered for Bhima and Arjuna!

Sanjaya continued, "Then, as the armies faced each other, a strange thing happened. Even though there were no clouds, there was thunder! The wind blew, dust filled the air, and meteors fell from the sky! The sun looked weak, the ground shook, and everyone could hear the thunder. The flags on the elephants and chariots made a loud noise. The Pandavas, ready for battle, stood bravely, their eyes fixed on Bhima, their mighty warrior."
