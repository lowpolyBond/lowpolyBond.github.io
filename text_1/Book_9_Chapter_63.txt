King Yudhishthira had won a big war.  He beat his cousins, the Kauravas. But Yudhishthira was worried.  His aunt, Gandhari, was very sad. Her sons and grandsons had all died in the war.  Gandhari was very powerful because she was a very holy woman.  Yudhishthira was scared that Gandhari's sadness would be so strong, it could hurt everyone!

Yudhishthira was afraid of Gandhari's anger. He thought her sadness was so powerful, it could even destroy the whole world!  So he sent Krishna, a very kind and powerful friend, to talk to Gandhari.  Krishna was like a superhero. He had helped Yudhishthira win the war by being his chariot driver.

Krishna went to see Gandhari and her husband, King Dhritarashtra.  He talked to them kindly. He told them that everyone makes mistakes, even kings. He said that the war was caused by many things, including bad choices and the unfairness of fate.  Krishna explained that Yudhishthira was very sad too and didn't want to hurt anyone.

Krishna made Gandhari and Dhritarashtra feel better.  He calmed Gandhari's anger.  But then, Krishna discovered a secret plan!  Drona's son was planning to attack the Pandavas while they were sleeping!  So Krishna quickly said goodbye and rushed back to warn the Pandavas.  He saved them from danger and then everyone was safe and sound.
