King Dhritarashtra was worried.  His son, Duryodhana, wanted to fight the Pandavas, his cousins.  Dhritarashtra pleaded, "Duryodhana, please don't fight!  The Pandavas are good people. Half the kingdom is enough for you. Give them back what's rightfully theirs!  Even our best warriors – Bhishma, Drona, everyone – doesn't want a war. It's Karna and Dussasana and Sakuni who are pushing you!"

But Duryodhana wouldn't listen. He boasted, "I'll fight the Pandavas alone, with only Karna! We'll win! It'll be like a big sacrifice, with my chariot as the altar, my sword as the spoon, and my arrows as the grass!  I'll never share the kingdom with them, not even a tiny bit!"

Dhritarashtra was heartbroken. He shook his head and said, "I give up on Duryodhana!  He's going to die! The Pandavas are strong like tigers. Bhima is the strongest! He'll crush your army like stepping on ants. You'll see elephants lying dead, your soldiers falling like leaves, and then you'll wish you listened to me!  Make peace now, or you'll all be killed!"

Then, the storyteller, Vaisampayana, said the king turned to his advisor Sanjaya... and the story continues.
