Once upon a time, during a big battle, Karna, a mighty warrior, was fighting the Kaikaya soldiers. He was super strong! He defeated five hundred of them with his arrows.  The Kaikaya soldiers were scared and ran to Bhima for help.

Karna, still on his chariot, zoomed towards Yudhishthira, the Pandava king.  Yudhishthira was hurt and slowly moving back.  Karna, wanting to help his friend Duryodhana, shot three arrows at Yudhishthira. Yudhishthira fought back, hitting Karna and his driver.

Yudhishthira's twin brothers, Nakula and Sahadeva, quickly jumped in to protect him. They shot many arrows at Karna. Karna fought back, hitting them too! He even broke Yudhishthira's chariot, killing his horses. He even knocked off Yudhishthira's helmet!  He did the same to Nakula's chariot.

Now Nakula and Sahadeva were without chariots.  Shalya, their uncle, saw this and shouted at Karna, "You should be fighting Arjuna! Why are you wasting your energy on Yudhishthira? You're getting tired, your chariot is damaged, and you have few arrows left! You'll look silly when Arjuna sees you like this!"

But Karna, very angry, kept fighting. He hurt Nakula and Sahadeva again and pushed Yudhishthira away. Shalya shouted again, "Karna, go help Duryodhana who is in trouble with Bhima!  Arjuna is winning the battle, his bow sounds like thunder! Help Duryodhana instead of fighting Yudhishthira!"

Finally, Karna saw Duryodhana in danger and raced to save him.  Yudhishthira, very hurt, went back to the Pandava camp.  He got his wounds treated.  Then he sent Nakula and Sahadeva to help Bhima, who was roaring in battle.  The two brothers got new chariots and rushed to join him.
