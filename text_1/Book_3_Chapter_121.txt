Once upon a time, a long, long time ago, a great king named Gaya had a very special party! He performed HUGE sacrifices to the gods.  He gave the gods special drinks, called Soma juice.  The gods loved it! They were so happy!

Gaya was super generous.  He made everything for the party out of gold!  Gold stakes, gold rings, gold bowls â€“ everything!  He had SEVEN of these amazing parties!  So much gold, you couldn't even count it all! It was like counting all the grains of sand on the beach, or all the stars in the sky!

Gaya gave the priests who helped him so much gold, they couldn't count it all either. He even gave them beautiful golden statues! He was so kind and generous that the gods were very, very pleased. Because of all these wonderful sacrifices, Gaya went to live happily with the gods in heaven.

A wise man named Lomasa told the Pandava brothers, Yudhishthira and his brothers, about this amazing story.  He said if they bathed in a special river, the Payosini River, they would also be blessed.  So the brothers went and bathed in the river.

Then, Lomasa told them about another special place, a hill made of sapphires and the Narmada River. He said bathing in the Narmada River would also bring blessings.  The brothers went to that place too, and gave lots of gifts to the priests there.

Lomasa also told them a story about a long, long time ago.  A king named Saryati also had a special sacrifice, where the god Indra himself came and drank the Soma juice!  But then, a powerful holy man named Chyavana got angry at Indra.  He even made Indra, the mighty god, weak for a little while!  Chyavana did this to help his wife.

Yudhishthira was amazed by all these stories and wanted to know more about how Chyavana made Indra weak.  He wanted to hear all about this incredible fight between a holy man and a powerful god.
