Once upon a time, five brothers – the Pandavas – wanted to learn about amazing Brahmanas (wise holy men).  They asked a very wise man named Markandeya to tell them a story.

Markandeya said, "A handsome prince went hunting in the forest.  He saw what he thought was a deer.  It was actually a holy man wearing an antelope skin!  The prince accidentally killed him.  He was very, very sad.

The prince told the other princes. They were sad too. They wanted to find out who the holy man was.  They went to another holy man, Arishtanemi, to ask for help.

The princes told Arishtanemi, "We killed a holy man!" Arishtanemi said, "Tell me everything!" After the princes explained, Arishtanemi asked them to return to where they left the body.

But when they went back, the holy man wasn't there!  They searched and searched, but he was gone. They felt very ashamed and confused.

Then, another holy man, Tarkshya, appeared. He said, "That was my son! He’s alive!" The princes were amazed! The holy man had come back to life!

They asked Tarkshya, "How did he come back to life?"

Tarkshya smiled. "Death can't touch us," he said.  "We do good things. We're kind to everyone. We share our food. We're peaceful and good. We live in holy places.  That's why we don't fear death."

The princes were happy to learn this. They thanked the holy man and went home, feeling much better. They learned that being good and kind is more important than anything else.
