Yudhishthira was very upset.  He asked Bhishma, "If doing something terrible is considered 'right', then what is *wrong*?  Should we even respect robbers? I'm confused and sad!"

Bhishma said, "I'm not just telling you what the old books say.  I'm sharing my wisdom and experience.  Being a good king means learning from many sources. You can't just follow one rule all the time.  A good king uses his brain and learns from others.  Sometimes, what seems wrong can actually be right, and vice versa.  A smart king understands this.  Ordinary people might not understand his choices."

Bhishma explained, "Some people are wise, some are not. A good king learns from the wise ones.  People who break rules criticize the rules.  People without money say rules about getting money are wrong. People who just want an easy life aren’t truly wise. They are like enemies of what's right.  Wise kings don't listen to them. They know what is truly right.”

He continued, "The best way to know what's right is to see what truly good people do.  Even a wise person can be wrong if they are angry or confused.  Follow the rules, but use your good judgment.  Even something an ordinary person says might be wise. A long time ago, Usanas told the Daityas that rules should make sense.  Don't follow rules that don't make sense. You were born to do big things. Look at me! I've helped many warriors reach heaven, even though some people don't like it.  Kings should always try to make everyone happy.  It’s just as bad to not punish someone who deserves it, as it is to punish someone who doesn’t deserve it. A weak king lets people fight like wolves!"

Bhishma said a king should make everyone do what’s right. If not, they’ll steal from each other. "A king who can't stop thieves is a bad king! Choose wise advisors, and rule fairly."  He added,  "A king shouldn’t be too strict or too soft. He needs to be wise, knowing when to be firm and when to be kind. Being a king is hard work, but you were born for it.  A great king protects good people and punishes bad ones."

Yudhishthira asked, "Is there one rule that's always true?"

Bhishma said, "Always respect wise priests. Treat them like gods. If they're happy, you'll be lucky. If they’re angry, you’ll be in trouble. They can be like magic – good or bad."
