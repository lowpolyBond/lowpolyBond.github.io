Once upon a time, in a great battle, two brave warriors fought!  Kshemadhurti shot many arrows at Vrihatkshatra.  Vrihatkshatra fought back, hitting Kshemadhurti with lots of arrows.  But Kshemadhurti, very angry, broke Vrihatkshatra's bow! Then he hit Vrihatkshatra again.  Vrihatkshatra got a new bow and, with a big smile, he made Kshemadhurti lose his chariot, his horses, and his driver.  Then, with one more arrow, Vrihatkshatra cut off Kshemadhurti's head!

Another brave warrior, Viradhanwan, fought Dhrishtaketu.  They shot thousands of arrows at each other!  It was like two elephants fighting in a forest, or two tigers in a cave!  They were so strong and fierce. Viradhanwan broke Dhrishtaketu's bow. Dhrishtaketu threw a powerful spear, and it killed Viradhanwan.

Sahadeva fought Durmukha, his own cousin! Durmukha shot many arrows, but Sahadeva was stronger.  Sahadeva broke Durmukha's flag, killed his horses, and even cut off his charioteer's head! Then he broke Durmukha's bow and hit him with more arrows.  Durmukha jumped to a new chariot, but Sahadeva killed the new charioteer too!

Nakula quickly defeated Vikarna. Vyaghradatta tried to hide Satyaki with his arrows, but brave Satyaki fought back and won!  He defeated many Magadha warriors, and their army ran away.

After all these amazing battles, the army was getting scared!  Even Drona, a very powerful warrior, got angry and charged towards Satyaki!  The battle was very exciting, with brave warriors and amazing fights.
