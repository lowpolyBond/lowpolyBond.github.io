Once upon a time, after a big battle, the Pandavas and their friends, the Yadavas, went to visit Bhishma, a great warrior who was lying injured.  They rode in fancy chariots that looked like strong castles!

They asked Bhishma if he slept well.  Then, Yudhishthira, the kindest of the Pandavas, asked Bhishma a very important question. He said, "Bhishma, kings are just like everyone else. They have arms, legs, and feelings. They get happy and sad. They are born and they die. So why do people obey them? Why does everyone listen to a king?  Why does the whole world feel happy or sad depending on how the king feels? Tell me, please!"

Bhishma smiled. "Long, long ago," he said, "there were no kings. Everyone helped each other. But then, people started making mistakes. They became greedy and angry. They forgot what was right and wrong.  The good things, like the holy books (Vedas), disappeared. The gods got scared!"

"The gods asked the Great Creator for help. The Creator made a big, big book with lots of rules – about being good, being successful, and being happy. It also talked about how to be a good king.  This book helped the gods, and it helped to teach people how to live together."

"The Creator's book was very long, so people made it shorter and shorter over time.  Eventually, a very good man named Prithu was chosen to be the first king. He made the earth smooth and even.  He helped everyone, he made sure there was plenty of food. Because he was so good and fair, everyone listened to him and called him 'king'."

"That's why kings rule," Bhishma explained. "They help keep everyone safe and happy by following the rules and being fair.  A good king is like a god on Earth – he protects his people, so they respect him."

Bhishma told Yudhishthira lots more about the history of kings and how the world works – about rules and fairness, and how a good king is important.  He talked about how to be a good leader and how to protect a kingdom.  It was a very long and interesting story!

Finally, Bhishma said, "Yudhishthira, I've told you the whole story.  Is there anything else you’d like to know?"
