Sanjaya, a wise man, watched the battle.  He saw Karna, a strong warrior, coming towards Arjuna. Karna was so strong, even the gods were afraid of him!  He was like a huge wave crashing onto the shore.

Sanjaya told Arjuna, "Look! There's Karna, in his amazing chariot!  It has beautiful white horses and Shalya is his driver.  Be brave, Arjuna!  Karna's chariot is all decked out with flags and bells. It's so beautiful it looks like a chariot from heaven! Look at his banner – it’s like Indra’s bow, splitting the sky! Karna is fighting for Duryodhana.  He’s shooting arrows like rain from the clouds. Shalya, Karna’s driver, is guiding the horses. You can hear the drums, the horns, and Karna's powerful bow twanging. The other warriors are running away, scared like deer seeing a lion!"

Sanjaya continued, "Arjuna, you must defeat Karna. Only you are strong enough.  You can defeat anyone – even the gods! It’s like fighting Lord Shiva himself, but you've already pleased the gods, so you will win.  Fight like Indra, the god of thunder, fought the demon Namuci.  Go, Arjuna, and be victorious!"

Arjuna replied to Krishna, his friend and charioteer, "I will win, Krishna! You're with me, so I have nothing to fear.  Drive faster, Krishna! Today, I will defeat Karna or die trying!  This battle will be remembered forever!"  Arjuna urged Krishna to speed up his chariot. They rushed towards Karna, like two elephants charging each other.  "Faster, Krishna! Time is running out!" Arjuna shouted, and then they charged into battle.
