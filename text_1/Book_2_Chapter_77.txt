After his father died, Prince Bharata felt very sad.  On the eleventh day, he cleaned himself. On the twelfth day, he gave away lots of things to the priests.  He gave them shiny jewels, gold, silver, beautiful clothes, and many other gifts. He even gave away lots of white goats and cows, and even servants, chariots, and horses!

On the thirteenth day, Bharata went to see his father's ashes. He was very upset.  He cried, "My father! My brother Rama is gone to the forest, and now you are gone too!  Where did you go, leaving my mother Kaushalya all alone?"  Bharata was so sad he fell to the ground and cried even more. Everyone helped him up.

Bharata's brother, Shatrughna, was so sad he fainted! When he woke up, he cried, "Our stepmother, Kaikeyi, made all this happen!  Our father is gone!  Rama is gone!  Who will give us nice things and food now? I can't live without them.  I'm going to the forest too!"  The palace servants were so sad they also fell to the ground.

Then, their wise priest, Vasishtha, helped Bharata up. He said, "Prince, thirteen days have passed.  Everyone dies. It's part of life.  Let's gather your father's ashes."  Sumantra helped Shatrughna. He too talked about how everyone is born and dies.

Bharata and Shatrughna, with red eyes from crying, were very sad.  But the wise people helped them remember they needed to finish the special ceremonies for their father.
