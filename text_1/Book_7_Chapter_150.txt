King Dhritarashtra was worried. He asked Sanjaya, "Sanjaya, after the king of the Sindhus and Bhurisravas were killed, what happened?  What did Drona say when Duryodhana spoke to him?"

Sanjaya said, "King, after those strong warriors died, everyone was very sad. They didn't listen to Duryodhana's plans. Many soldiers died because of his bad plans. Drona was very upset when Duryodhana talked to him. He said, 'Duryodhana, why do you hurt me with your words? I told you Arjuna is a great warrior, impossible to beat!  Arjuna helped Sikhandin kill Bhishma.  Seeing Bhishma, the strongest warrior, die, I knew we were going to lose.  Who can we trust now? It all started with the unfair dice game.  Sakuni's dice were like sharp arrows, killing us.  Vidura warned you, but you didn't listen! You ignored his good advice about peace, and now look what happened!  You treated Krishna so badly!  You cheated at the dice game and sent the Pandavas to the forest. I'm the only Brahmin who would hurt such good people. You, with Sakuni, made the Pandavas angry.  You and Karna and Duhsasana made them even angrier! You all tried to save the king of the Sindhus, and failed.  Now he's dead, and Jayadratha is dead too. Even I am not safe. I need to kill Sikhandin before I can rest. Why do you blame me? Look, even Bhishma is gone!  The Pandavas are attacking! I will fight until the end, for you.  Go tell my son Aswatthaman to fight hard but to always be kind, honest, and fair.  He should respect everyone, especially Brahmins.  Then I will go and fight!' And he went to battle."
