Once upon a time, after a big battle between the gods and the demons, a good king named Yudhishthira was very sad. He lost his friends and his kingdom. He asked his wise teacher, Bhishma, "What can help someone who's lost everything?"

Bhishma said, "The best thing is to be brave and not let sadness take over.  If you're brave, you won't get sick. Being happy and healthy helps you get your life back on track.  Doing what's right always helps too."

Bhishma then told Yudhishthira a story about King Vali, a powerful demon.  Vali had been defeated by the mighty god Indra, who ruled the heavens.  Indra, riding his elephant Airavata, found Vali in a cave.  Vali had lost his kingdom, his family, and everything he owned. But he wasn't sad!

Indra was surprised. "Why aren't you upset, Vali?" he asked. "You've lost everything!"

Vali smiled.  "Indra," he said, "winning and losing are part of life.  You won this time, but you might lose someday, just like I did.  Everything changes.  Being sad won't change it.  We are all controlled by Time.  Time makes us kings, and Time takes away our kingdoms.  Good deeds or bad deeds don't stop Time."

Vali reminded Indra that many great kings before him had also lost everything. Even powerful demons and gods were not safe from Time.

Indra listened to Vali. He saw that Vali was wise and brave, not sad.  He realized that even a powerful god like him couldn't control Time.  Indra felt sorry for Vali, and he set him free.  Then Indra went home, happy to be king, but knowing that even his reign wouldn't last forever.

Bhishma finished the story, "See, Yudhishthira? Bravery and wisdom are better than sadness.  They help you face whatever life brings."
