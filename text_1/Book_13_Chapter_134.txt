Long ago, in a land filled with magic, a wise warrior named Skanda shared some secrets.  He said, "Listen closely! If you take a tiny bit of dirt from a blue bull's horns, rub it on your body for three days, then wash it off, you'll be very lucky! You'll be super strong and brave, and always win!"

Skanda had another secret.  "Take a copper bowl," he said. "Put some yummy food mixed with honey in it. Give it to the moon when it's full and bright.  Many magical beings will be happy, and the ocean will grow bigger!"

Then, another wise person, Vishnu, spoke. "If you listen carefully every day to stories about doing good things, you'll be safe from bad things. You'll be brave and happy!"  He added, "Reading these stories or telling them to others is also very good.  It makes the magical beings happy!"

A great warrior named Bhishma also shared these secrets.  He said, "These are special, powerful secrets from the gods.  They are more valuable than all the gold and jewels in the world! But," he warned, "don't tell these secrets to anyone who isn't kind, doesn't believe in magic, or is mean to others. Only good people should know these secrets."
