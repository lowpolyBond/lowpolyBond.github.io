Once upon a time, there was a king named Pandu. He loved to hunt in the forest.  One day, he saw two deer.  Thinking they were just ordinary deer, he shot them with his arrows.  But these weren't ordinary deer! They were a magical deer-couple, actually a Rishi (a wise man) and his wife, disguised as deer.

The Rishi was very sad. He said to Pandu, "King, you killed us while we were together. Thatâ€™s very cruel!  It's wrong to hurt anyone, especially when they aren't expecting it."

Pandu said, "Kings hunt animals. It's what we do. Rishi Agastya, a great wise man, even sacrificed deer to the gods!"

The Rishi explained, "But it's not right to kill anyone during a special moment. You should have waited."

Pandu didn't listen. He said that kings hunt whenever they want.

The Rishi was very upset. He cursed Pandu, "Because you were cruel, you will die the moment you are with your wife."  Then, the Rishi died.  Pandu felt very, very sad. He was sorry for what he did.

The story then tells us about Pandu's sons, the Pandavas, who were very brave and strong.  But because of Pandu's actions, a sadness hung over them even before their birth.  But that's another story for another time!
