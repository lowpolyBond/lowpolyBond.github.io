The great battle raged!  Arjuna, Karna, and Bhima were very angry.  Arjuna had already won many fights.  He told Krishna, "Look! Our army is losing! Karna is hurting our best fighters! I can't even see King Yudhishthira!  It's still early in the day, but nobody from the enemy is fighting me.  Please, Krishna, go find Yudhishthira. I'll fight again when I know he's safe."

Krishna quickly drove his chariot to find Yudhishthira.  The battle was terrible!  Krishna showed Arjuna the battlefield.  "Look, Arjuna," he said, "so many brave warriors are dead!  Everywhere there are broken bows, arrows, swords, and shields.  Broken maces, spears, and axes are scattered on the ground.  Thousands of soldiers lie dead.  Their bodies are bruised and cut.  The ground is covered in blood."

Krishna pointed out the fallen chariots and dead horses.  He showed Arjuna the broken elephant howdahs and their scattered decorations.  "Look," he said, "even the ground is covered in broken jewelry and the things from the soldiers’ armour."  He showed Arjuna the wounded soldiers crying out for help, and their families trying to help them.  "Some soldiers are still fighting even though they are hurt. Others are searching for water for the wounded. Some soldiers are so sad, they forget the fight," said Krishna.

Krishna then pointed out the different leaders. "Look!  King Yudhishthira is surrounded by the enemy!  There's Karna, he’s strong like a fire! Bhima is fighting bravely, followed by many others.  Drona's son is fighting too, and Dhrishtadyumna is fighting him back. The Srinjayas are battling bravely.  But many are falling!"

Krishna told Arjuna everything.  Then, a HUGE battle started! The armies roared like lions. The terrible fight continued because of a bad plan.  Many warriors from both sides died in that terrible war.
