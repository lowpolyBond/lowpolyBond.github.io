Long ago, in the high Himalaya mountains, lived Lord Shiva, a very powerful god.  He lived on a mountain top called Munjaban.  He was with his wife, Parvati (Uma).  Lots of other magical beings lived there too: friendly and scary goblins, gods and goddesses, even the wind gods!  They all worshipped Lord Shiva.

The mountain was magical.  No one could see its true shape.  It wasn't hot or cold, and the sun and wind didn't touch it. No one ever got old, hungry, thirsty, or died there!  And guess what? It had lots and lots of gold mines!  But scary goblins guarded the gold.

King Samvarta told Prince Marutta, “Go to Munjaban and ask Lord Shiva for help.  Lord Shiva has many names: Rudra, Mahadeva, and many more! Show him respect, and he'll let you take some gold.”

Prince Marutta went to the mountain. He bowed down to Lord Shiva and asked for help. Lord Shiva was happy, and Marutta got lots of gold!  He used the gold to make amazing things for a big celebration.

When the wise teacher Vrihaspati heard about Marutta’s good fortune, he felt sad.  He was jealous of Samvarta, who helped Marutta.  He got very sick and unhappy.  Then, the other gods went to help him.
