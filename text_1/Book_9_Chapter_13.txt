Once upon a time, in a great battle, King Yudhishthira was in trouble.  Shalya, a powerful warrior, was attacking him!

But Yudhishthira's brave brothers and friends rushed to help. Bhima, Satyaki, Nakula, and Sahadeva surrounded Shalya in their chariots.  They shot lots of arrows!  Everyone watching cheered.  Even the magical beings called Siddhas were amazed!

Bhima hit Shalya with eight arrows. Satyaki, wanting to save Yudhishthira, shot a hundred arrows and roared like a lion! Nakula and Sahadeva also shot many arrows.

Shalya was strong! He fought back! He shot many arrows at Bhima, Satyaki, and the others.  He even broke Sahadeva's bow!

Then Yudhishthira got angry. He shot many arrows at Shalya and his chariot.  Shalya fought back, too.

Satyaki threw a fancy spear at Shalya, and Bhima, Nakula, and Sahadeva threw other weapons.  Shalya was so skillful; he broke every weapon!  He even roared like a lion!  

Satyaki got mad and shot more arrows.  Shalya shot even more arrows back, pushing the Pandavas back.

King Duryodhana, who was on Shalya's side, thought he'd won. He thought the Pandavas were going to lose!

Bhima, Nakula, Sahadeva, and Satyaki kept fighting Shalya.  They were surrounded by his arrows!

Yudhishthira worried. He wondered if they could win.  Shalya was so powerful and shot so many arrows, the sky was filled with them!  It looked like a storm of golden arrows!  Even the gods were surprised by how many arrows Shalya was shooting!

Shalya roared like a lion, and the Pandavas found it hard to fight him. But they didn't give up!  They kept fighting bravely, even though Shalya was very, very strong.
