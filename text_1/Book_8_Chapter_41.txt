Shalya, Karna's chariot driver, had some advice for him.  He said, "Karna, you're acting like someone who's drunk! I'm your friend, so I'll help you see things clearly.  Let me tell you a story."

Shalya told a story about a crow. This crow was spoiled!  Some nice kids gave him yummy leftovers every day – meat, milk, honey, everything! The crow got so proud, he thought he was better than all the other birds.

One day, some graceful swans came by. The kids told the crow the swans were amazing, and the crow believed them.  He challenged the best swan to a race!

"Let's see who can fly best!"  the crow boasted.  He planned to do a hundred different fancy flying tricks! The swan just laughed.  The swan said, "I'll fly in one way – the usual way – and you can do all your tricks."

They raced. The crow zipped and zoomed, showing off all his moves. The swans flew calmly. For a while, the crow seemed to be winning, because his tricks were so flashy. But, the crow got tired.  He was flying way too hard! The swan flew smoothly and steadily.  Soon the crow was very tired, and he couldn't keep up.  He was over the ocean, with no place to land!  He was scared.

He cried out to the swan for help. "Please save me!" he begged.  The swan rescued the tired crow and took him back to land.

Shalya said to Karna, "You're like that crow! You're getting leftovers from the Kauravas, and you're acting too big for your britches.  You should respect your enemies, like Arjuna.  You had chances to beat him, but you didn't. You even ran away from the Gandharvas! The swan was strong and steady;  Arjuna is strong and steady.  Don't be foolish and proud. Be smart and wise. Learn from the crow's mistake, and don't make the same one!"
