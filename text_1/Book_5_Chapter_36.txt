Once upon a time, a wise man named Vidura told a story.  He said, "Long ago, some powerful gods, called the Sadhyas, met a very wise man who was begging for food.  The gods asked the wise man, 'Who are you? You seem very clever and calm.'

The wise man answered, 'Gods, I've learned that to be truly happy, we must be peaceful inside.  We should treat everyone kindly, even if they are unkind to us.  If someone says mean things, don't say mean things back.  It's better to ignore them.  The bad things they do, become their problem, not yours! Don't be mean to others. Don't argue with your friends. Don't hang around with bad people. Don’t be bossy or rude. Don't use angry words. Angry words hurt people like fire!  A wise person, even when hurt by mean words, stays calm and remembers the mean person takes on the badness of their actions.  We become like the people we spend time with. If you spend time with good people, you become good. If you avoid bad things, you won't suffer. A truly good person is happy for everyone and wishes no one harm. They are honest, humble, and in control of their feelings. A bad person is easily angered, ungrateful, and doesn't make friends easily.'"

Then, King Dhritarashtra asked Vidura, "What makes a family great?"

Vidura said, "A great family shows kindness, is smart, prays, marries well, shares food, and respects the good things in life. They are honest and never hurt others.  They don't disrespect the elders. Bad things make a family fall. Things like not sharing, being mean to others, and being dishonest. Wealth is nice, but good behavior is even better. A truly great family is kind and helpful. Nobody in our family should be a bully, a liar, or a thief."

Vidura continued, "A true friend is someone you can trust, like a father. A good friend doesn't make you afraid.  Unstable people can't make good friends.  Success leaves those who can't control themselves.  Even birds won’t touch the bodies of people who are ungrateful to their friends. Be kind to your friends whether you are rich or poor.

Sadness is bad. It hurts your body, your mind, and makes your enemies happy!  We all experience good times and bad times.  Wise people stay calm during both.  Our feelings are always moving around inside us, like restless bees.

King Dhritarashtra worried about a big battle. He was afraid his sons would lose. He asked Vidura for help.

Vidura said, "King, the best way to avoid fear is to be wise, kind, and control your wants.  Learn from others.  Peace comes when we control ourselves.  People who are at peace with their families are happy and successful.  A family is strong when everyone works together, like many thin threads making a strong rope.  Without good health, nothing is possible. Anger is like a poison. It hurts! Let your sons be kind to the Pandavas, and the Pandavas be kind to your sons. Live in peace! You, King, are the hope of your family. Please make peace with the Pandavas!"
