Once upon a time, two giant, mean brothers, Sunda and Upasunda, were causing lots of trouble. They were so strong and mean that they were making everyone very sad.  The good gods and wise saints were very upset.

They went to the Grandsire, the most powerful god of all.  He was surrounded by other important gods like Mahadeva, the fire god Agni, and the wind god Vayu.  Many, many wise saints were there too!

The saints told the Grandsire all about Sunda and Upasunda's bad deeds.  The Grandsire thought hard. He decided he needed a plan to stop them.  He called Viswakarman, a magical builder, and said, "Build me a beautiful woman!"

Viswakarman worked carefully. He made a girl so stunningly beautiful that she was like a living jewel!  She was so beautiful that everyone who saw her would fall in love.  The Grandsire named her Tilottama, which means "one made of tiny pieces of jewels."

Tilottama asked the Grandsire what she was supposed to do. He said, "Go to Sunda and Upasunda.  Your beauty will make them fight each other, and they'll destroy themselves!"

Tilottama went to see the brothers. As she walked past the gods, even the great god Mahadeva couldn't help but look at her.  He was so captivated, he grew another face! He got a new face for each side he looked at her from, until he had four faces, and so many eyes! The others couldn't stop looking at her either.

Everyone knew Tilottama's plan would work. She went off to meet the brothers, and the Grandsire sent everyone else home.  He knew Tilottama's amazing beauty would be enough to defeat the mean brothers!
