Once upon a time, in the land of Hastinapura,  Yudhishthira, a very good and thoughtful prince, wanted to learn how to be a great king. He bowed to the wise Bhishma, a powerful warrior and elder, and asked him many questions.

Yudhishthira said, "Being a king is very important.  It's a big job, and I want to do it right.  Grandfather Bhishma, please tell me everything I need to know about being a good king.  A good king keeps everyone happy and safe.  Being a good king helps everyone be happy, healthy and find peace."

Bhishma smiled and said, "Of course, my dear Yudhishthira. I will teach you."  He bowed to the gods and the wise Brahmins (priests) before he began.

Bhishma said, "First, a king must always be respectful to the gods and the Brahmins.  He should be kind and hardworking.  He must also be brave and quick to act.  A king needs both hard work and a little bit of luck. But hard work is the most important. Even if things go wrong, he must keep trying.  Above all, a king must always tell the truth. Truth is very valuable.  A truthful king earns everyone's respect."

Bhishma continued, "A good king is kind but strong. If he is too kind, people might not respect him. If he is too harsh, people will be afraid. He needs to be like the sun – warm but not too hot.  He should be wise and understand his friends and enemies.  A king should not have bad habits, but if he does, he shouldn’t let them control him."

Bhishma explained that a king must treat his people like a mother cares for her child.  He must protect them even if it means giving up things he loves. He must be brave and punish those who do wrong.  But he shouldn’t be too friendly with his servants.  If he is too friendly, his servants might become disrespectful, lazy, or even dishonest. They might disobey him, steal from him, or even try to control him!

Bhishma warned Yudhishthira to be careful. A good king needs to be strong, kind, wise and truthful. A good king is like the sun, bringing warmth and light to everyone.  And most importantly, he should always remember to be a good and just ruler.
