Once upon a time, during the great war, a kind king tried to make peace.  But Princess Krishna, the daughter of King Drupada, was very sad.  She was married to one of the Pandava brothers.

She talked to Krishna, a powerful warrior, also known as Lord Krishna.  She told him how the Kauravas, the bad guys, had been unfair to the Pandavas, her husband's family. They had tricked the Pandavas out of their land, leaving them with only five tiny villages.  The Kauravas had even been mean to her!  They’d grabbed her hair and insulted her in front of everyone!

Princess Krishna reminded Krishna of the Kauravas’ meanness. She said, "They only offered a few small villages instead of giving back what they stole!"  She explained that the Pandavas were strong enough to fight back.  She didn't want peace if it meant the Kauravas kept being bad.  She wanted them punished for being so unfair!

Princess Krishna felt terrible.  She had been treated badly, and her family had been wronged. She cried and cried.  She said, "If my husbands and their friends don't fight, my father and brothers will!"  She even said that her own sons would fight!  She wanted revenge, especially on Dussasana, who had pulled her hair.

Lord Krishna comforted her.  He promised, "Don't worry!  I will make sure the Kauravas are defeated.  You will see your husbands victorious, and the bad guys will be punished." He promised that justice would be served, no matter what.  He said his words were as strong as mountains, and nothing could stop what was going to happen.  He made Princess Krishna promise to stop crying.

Lord Krishna said he would make sure everything would be okay. He promised that justice would be served and that everyone would be safe. Princess Krishna felt much better after talking to him.
