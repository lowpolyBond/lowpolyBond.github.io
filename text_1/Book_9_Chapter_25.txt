Arjuna, the great warrior, was amazing!  He shot arrows like rain from a huge cloud.  His arrows were super strong and fast.  They zoomed through the air, hitting the enemy army!

Soldiers ran away! Some left their dads and brothers. Some lost their chariot drivers or their horses!  Some chariots broke, and some soldiers ran out of arrows. Lots of soldiers were hurt and scared, even if they weren't hit.  Some tried to save their sons and families. Others yelled for help.  Many brave warriors were hit and hurt badly.

Some soldiers helped their friends, gave them water, and then went back to fight.  Others rested their horses, got new armor, or helped their families to safety before going back into battle.  Some even fixed their chariots and got back in the fight.  They looked shiny and strong, like magical giants!

Duryodhana's army fought hard, but Arjuna and his friends, like Dhrishtadyumna and Shikhandi, fought even harder. Dhrishtadyumna was very brave and strong! Duryodhana's chariot was destroyed by Arjuna's arrows. Duryodhana had to run away on his horse!

Then, 3,000 huge elephants surrounded the five Pandava brothers. They looked like the planets surrounded by clouds! Arjuna, with Krishna driving his chariot, shot his arrows.  Each arrow killed one giant elephant!  Bhima, super strong, jumped down from his chariot and smashed the elephants with his big club!  The elephants ran around and fell down, making a huge mess. The Kaurava army was really scared!  Yudhishthira and the twins also helped fight the elephants.

When Duryodhana was gone, Ashvatthama, Kripa, and Kritavarma looked for him.  They asked everyone, "Where is Duryodhana?"  They were worried he was dead. Some soldiers told them he was with Subala's son.

The Pandavas and their army kept fighting bravely.  The Kauravas were running out of weapons and were very scared.  Even Sanjaya (the storyteller) fought alongside his friends. They fought very hard, but eventually, they lost that battle. Then, Satyaki, a powerful warrior, chased after Sanjaya!  Finally, Bhima and Arjuna finished off the elephants.  The elephants were so big, they blocked the Pandavas.  Bhima had to move the elephants out of the way so everyone could escape! Ashvatthama, Kripa, and Kritavarma went to find Duryodhana, who had run away to find Subala's son.
