Once upon a time, King Bhima held a big party to find a husband for his beautiful daughter, Damayanti.  Many kings came, hoping to marry her!  The party was amazing – a huge hall with shiny golden pillars. All the kings sat down, looking strong and handsome.

Damayanti walked in, and everyone looked at her!  But there was a problem.  Four handsome kings looked exactly alike!  One of them was Prince Nala, but Damayanti couldn't tell who he was. She was very worried!

"How will I find Nala?" she wondered.  She remembered some special things about gods – things that regular people didn’t have.  She prayed to the gods for help.

The gods heard her prayer!  They made themselves shine brightly, so Damayanti could see them easily. They didn't sweat or get dirty, and they didn't touch the ground.  Prince Nala was different; he was sweaty and dusty, just like a regular person.

Damayanti knew right away who Nala was!  She shyly gave him a flower garland.  The other kings were sad, but everyone else cheered!  The gods were happy too!

One god even gave Nala a special gift – he could see the gods whenever he wanted! Other gods gave him more amazing gifts.

King Bhima was very happy.  He gave Nala and Damayanti a big wedding party. Nala and Damayanti lived happily ever after. They had children and ruled their kingdom wisely and kindly.  They were very loved by everyone. They were so happy, just like a king and queen in a fairy tale!
