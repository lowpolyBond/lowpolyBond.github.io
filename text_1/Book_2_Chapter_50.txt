Rama said goodbye to Ayodhya, his beautiful city.  He held his hands together and said, "Dear Ayodhya, I'm going away for a while.  I'll be back soon!"  Tears filled his eyes as he spoke to his people. "Thank you for being so kind," he said. "Please go home now."

The people bowed and sadly went home, crying as they went.  Rama, seeing their sadness, told his driver to go quickly.  He wanted them to stop crying.

As they traveled, Rama saw many happy towns and villages.  Beautiful gardens, lots of cows, and people singing songs. Everywhere he saw temples.

He reached the holy river Ganga.  It was so beautiful!  There were holy people living nearby, and it sparkled in the sun.  Swans swam on the water, and lotuses floated. It looked like a magical place!  The river was so wide and powerful!  It flowed and flowed like a long, sparkling ribbon.

Rama wanted to rest. He saw a big tree near the river. "Let's stop here," he told his driver, Sumantra.

A friendly king named Guha lived nearby. He was a ferryman, but also a kind leader.  When Guha heard that Rama was there, he rushed to greet him.  He offered Rama delicious food and a place to stay.

Rama was grateful, but he said, “Thank you, Guha!  I only need a little grass for the horses. I'm living a simple life now.”

Guha happily provided grass for the horses.  That night, Rama, Lakshmana, and Sumantra talked and slept under the big tree.  Rama, even though he was a prince, slept on the ground.  He was happy to be near the peaceful river.
