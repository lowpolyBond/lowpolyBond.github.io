King Janamejaya was a very smart king. He heard a story about his ancestors coming back to life and then disappearing. He was amazed! He asked Vaisampayana, a wise teacher, "How can people who are dead come back to life?"

Vaisampayana smiled.  "Everything we do has a result," he said.  "Our bodies are made from what we do. The things that make up the world – earth, air, fire, water, and space – are always there. They never disappear."

He explained, "Think of a mirror.  You see your reflection, but the reflection isn't really you.  It's just an image. Our soul is like that. It's always there, even when our body is gone. It experiences good things and bad things because of the things we do."

"As long as we have things we need to experience because of what we did, we live in a body," Vaisampayana continued. "But when everything we’ve done is finished, our soul moves on.  It's like the parts of a toy that are put together to make a whole – when they come apart, they were always there."

"When we make offerings to the gods, like in big sacrifices," he added, "the gods help guide our souls.  Everything is connected. Because the soul and the things that make up the world never truly go away, people just seem to appear and disappear."

"Don't be too sad when people leave," Vaisampayana said kindly. "Sadness comes from letting go. If you understand that our bodies are different from our souls, you won't be so sad.  Knowing this helps us understand things better."

"Sometimes we see things, and sometimes we don't. It's like a game of hide-and-seek.  But our souls are always there, though they may be unseen."
