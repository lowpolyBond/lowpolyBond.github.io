Once upon a time, a wise man named Saunaka asked Sauti, "Sauti, you know so many stories! Tell me about the Bhrigu family."

Sauti said, "I know all the stories my father told me, and the stories of other wise men.  The Bhrigu family is very important.  It all started with a great saint named Bhrigu."

Bhrigu was a very special saint, born from a fire during a magical ceremony.  He had a son named Chyavana, who was very good. Chyavana had a son named Pramati, and Pramati had a son named Ruru.  Ruru's son was Sunaka, a very good and wise man â€“ your ancestor, Saunaka!"

Saunaka asked, "But why was Bhrigu's son called Chyavana? Tell me that story, Sauti!"

Sauti said, "Bhrigu loved his wife, Puloma, very much.  One day, Bhrigu went away to bathe.  A mean Rakshasa (a kind of demon) named Puloma came to Bhrigu's house.  He saw Bhrigu's wife and wanted her for himself.  He gave her some forest fruits, but he really wanted to take her away!"

"The Rakshasa said, 'I chose Puloma to be my wife first!  Bhrigu tricked her father!'  He wanted the fire god, Agni, to tell him if he was right.  Agni was scared! He didn't want to make the Rakshasa angry, or make Bhrigu angry either.

Agni finally spoke, "The Rakshasa chose Puloma first, but he didn't marry her properly. Puloma's father gave her to Bhrigu, and the wedding was done correctly.  So, Puloma is Bhrigu's wife."

The Rakshasa was very angry he couldn't take Puloma.  And that, Saunaka, is how Bhrigu's son got the name Chyavana, from that whole scary situation involving Puloma!"
