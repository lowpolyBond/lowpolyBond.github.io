King Yudhishthira loved truth. He asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandfather, tell me about truth! What is it? How can I be truthful?"

Bhishma smiled.  "Truth is very important," he said. "It's like a shining light, always pure and good.  Everyone should always try to be truthful. Itâ€™s the best thing you can be.  Truth is like prayer, it's like doing yoga, and it's the most important thing in the world."

Bhishma explained that truth has many parts:

* **Fairness:** Treating everyone equally.
* **Self-control:** Not wanting what others have.
* **Forgiveness:** Letting go of anger.
* **Humility:** Being kind and modest.
* **Patience:** Waiting calmly.
* **Kindness:** Being nice to everyone.
* **Giving up things:** Sharing what you have.
* **Thinking deeply:**  Thinking about what's right.
* **Respect:** Showing others you care.
* **Courage:** Being brave.
* **Compassion:** Being kind and caring to others.
* **Not hurting anyone:**  Being gentle with everyone.

"These are all different ways to show truth," Bhishma said. "Truth is always the same, it never changes.  You can learn to be truthful by being kind and doing what's right."

He told Yudhishthira that being truthful was more important than anything else.  "Once," Bhishma said, "they weighed a thousand special sacrifices against truth. Guess what? Truth was heavier!"  That's how important truth is!
