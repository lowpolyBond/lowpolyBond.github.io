The Pandavas were running away.  Bhima, the strongest one, walked through the forest.  He was so big and strong, the trees shook as he walked past!  He pushed aside trees and vines like they were nothing.  He was like a giant elephant, strong and powerful.  

The Pandavas were hiding from their cousins, the Kauravas. They were very tired. Bhima carried his mother, Kunti, on his back. She was very delicate and kind.

They reached a scary forest.  It was dark and spooky, with scary sounds all around.  The Pandavas were hungry and thirsty.  Kunti was very thirsty.  She told her sons, "I am so thirsty!"

Bhima loved his mother. He wanted to help. He heard birds near a lake. He told his family, "I'll find water!"  He left them resting under a big banyan tree.

Bhima found a lake! He drank water and soaked his clothes. He ran back to his family with the wet clothes, to give them some water to drink.

When he got back, he saw his mother and brothers sleeping on the hard ground.  Bhima felt very sad. He cried.  He thought, "My brothers used to sleep on soft beds. Now they sleep on the ground! My mother, so beautiful and kind, is sleeping on the hard ground! They are so tired from running away."

Bhima was so angry at the Kauravas for making his family suffer!  He wanted to fight them, but his brother, Yudhishthira, was kind.  He wouldn't let Bhima hurt anyone.

Bhima decided to stay awake and watch over his family. He thought, "Maybe there's a town nearby. They can rest and get some food and water."  So Bhima sat there, watching over his sleeping family, until morning.
