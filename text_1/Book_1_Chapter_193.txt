Once upon a time, the five Pandava brothers went to a big wedding!  They won the beautiful princess Draupadi in a contest.  Happy and excited, they went back to their simple home, a potter's house.

They told their mother, Kunti, "Look, Mother! We won a prize!"  Kunti, without seeing who it was, said, "Share it amongst yourselves!"  Oops!  She only saw Draupadi *after* she said that.  She felt very worried.  What would they do?

Their oldest brother, Yudhishthira, thought hard. He said to Arjuna, the strongest brother, "Arjuna, you won her, so you should marry her."

But Arjuna said, "No! That's not right.  You should marry her first, then Bhima, then me, then Nakula, and lastly Sahadeva. We all want what's fair."

They all looked at Draupadi. She was so beautiful! They all loved her!  Yudhishthira realized what was happening. He remembered a wise man's words and said, "Draupadi will be the wife of all of us."

Everyone agreed!  It was a special kind of marriage.

Then, two very important guests arrived: Krishna and his brother Balarama.  They knew who the Pandavas were, even though the brothers were hiding.  Krishna told the Pandavas they were very lucky to be safe.  He told them to be careful and went back home.  The brothers were very happy to have Krishna's help and advice.
