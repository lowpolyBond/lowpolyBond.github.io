Once upon a time, a powerful king named Indra asked the wise Grandsire many questions about cows.  The Grandsire said, "Indra, your questions are very special!  Only a few people know the answers. Even you can't see all the amazing places I'm about to tell you about!"

The Grandsire explained that there are hidden, magical places.  Only kind people who are always good, like those who are faithful to their spouses or who follow religious rules, can find these special places.  These places are like beautiful dreams, full of wonder!  Time even stands still there!

There's no sickness, no sadness, no bad things at all.  The cows in these magical places have everything they want.  The Grandsire had been there himself!  He described sparkling lakes, lush forests, beautiful homes, and rolling hills – everything wonderful you can imagine.

How can you get there?  Be good!  Be kind to everyone, obey your teachers, and never be proud.  Don't eat meat, be truthful, respect your parents, and always help others. Never be angry with cows or wise people. If you’re always good, you can go to this amazing place! But if you're mean, lie, hurt others, or are not fair, you can't go.

The Grandsire continued, "Giving cows to good people is also very special. It brings great happiness.  If you give a cow you legally own, you’ll get amazing rewards!  The more good you are, the more magical the reward! Giving a cow is like giving many cows. A good person giving a cow gets much more reward than a bad person.

Giving a cow to a good person is like a magical wish!  Giving just one cow is better than giving many, if you are kind. If you’re a farmer and you give a cow, it’s even more special.  And if you’re really, really good and only eat one meal a day, sharing the other with cows, you get even more rewards than you can imagine!  It's like getting many, many magical gifts!"

The Grandsire then explained how to choose the best cows to give away – strong, healthy, happy cows and the best people to receive them: good, kind, poor Brahmins who really need help. You should also pick the right time and place to give the cows.  The best gifts are given with a pure heart.

He also said that rescuing cows and kind people from danger is like performing the biggest, most important sacrifice, bringing even more magical rewards!  People who follow cows through the forest, eating only simple food like grass, will also find happiness.

The Grandsire ended by saying, "If you are good and kind to cows, you will live happily ever after, in the most beautiful and magical places you can imagine, with all the happy cows and kind people!"
