Once upon a time, a king named Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, "Everyone is scared of sadness and death. How can we stop them?"

Bhishma said, "Let me tell you a story about Narada and Samanga."

Narada saw Samanga bowing very low to everyone.  Narada said, "Samanga, you're always so happy! You never seem worried. How do you do it?"

Samanga smiled. "I understand the past, present, and future," he explained. "I know everything happens for a reason. Rich people live, poor people live, even blind people and sick people live. We all live because of what we did in our past lives. Even the gods! So, what's the point of being sad?  Good things and bad things don't last forever."

"The wisest people," Samanga continued, "control their feelings.  If your feelings control you, you'll be unhappy.  Being proud because of good things only leads to sadness later. I don't want that! I don't care about being rich or famous. I don't worry about losing things.  Nothing in this world, not even magic words, can truly protect you from sadness in the future. Only being a good person can do that.  Being calm and patient helps, too. Happiness comes when you let go of sadness."

"I've learned all this through hard work and prayer," Samanga said. "So even when sadness comes, it can't really hurt me. I’m like someone who has drunk magical nectar – I don’t fear death or anything bad."

Yudhishthira learned a very important lesson:  being kind and calm, and understanding that everything happens for a reason, is the best way to be happy and not let sadness win!
