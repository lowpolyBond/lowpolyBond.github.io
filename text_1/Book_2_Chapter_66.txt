King Dasaratha died!  Queen Kaushalya was very sad.  She held his lifeless body in her lap.  He looked like a candle that had burned out.

"Kaikeyi," she cried to the other queen, "you got what you wanted.  You're queen now.  But you sent Rama away!  Now the king is gone too.  I feel lost and alone, like a traveler all by myself in a scary forest.  What's the point of living without my husband?  Only Kaikeyi would be happy, because she's not good."

Kaushalya was very upset.  She said Kaikeyi was greedy and hadn't thought about the consequences, like someone eating poison because they're hungry.  She said Kaikeyi had ruined everything, listening to a wicked woman.  She worried about Rama, Sita (Rama's wife), and Sita's father, King Janaka.  Sita would be scared in the forest with lions and tigers.  Janaka would be heartbroken.  Kaushalya wanted to die with her husband.

The wise minister stopped her. He gently took the king's body and put it in a jar of oil to keep it safe. The people couldn't burn the king's body yet because Rama wasn't there.  Everyone cried. The women wailed, "The king is dead!  He sent Rama away, and now he's gone too!  How can we live with mean Kaikeyi?"

The whole city of Ayodhya was sad.  It was dark and quiet, like a night without stars or a beautiful woman without her husband. People cried and blamed Kaikeyi. They missed Rama very much.  The queens lay on the ground, crying until it was dark.

The king's friends and family decided to wait for Rama before they burned the body.  They kept it safe in the jar of oil.  Everyone was heartbroken. The city was filled with sadness and tears.
