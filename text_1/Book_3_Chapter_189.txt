Long ago, in the land of the Mahabharata, a wise king named Yudhishthira asked a very old and wise man, Muni Markandeya, about the future.  Yudhishthira was curious about what would happen in the Kali Yuga, a time when people would be less good.

Muni Markandeya said, "Listen, King!  A long time ago, in the Krita Yuga, everyone was good.  It was like a bull with four strong legs. Then, in the Treta Yuga, people became a little less good.  It was like a bull with only three legs.  In the Dwapara Yuga, good and bad were equal â€“ like a bull with only two legs.

"In the Kali Yuga, which is coming, goodness will be very small, like just one leg of a bull! People will be mean.  They'll lie and cheat. They won't be as strong or live as long.  Smart people will pretend to be even smarter. Everyone will be greedy. Friends will fight.  People won't be as honest as they used to be.  Even priests and warriors will become less good."

Muni Markandeya continued, "Life will be hard. People will eat simple food like milk, fish, goats, and sheep, because cows will become rare.  People will even plant seeds in riverbanks, but the plants won't grow well.  Sons might hurt their fathers, and fathers might hurt their sons.  It will be a sad time. No one will really trust each other. Everyone will be selfish and mean."

He explained that people would live shorter lives, maybe only sixteen years.  Girls would have babies very young.  Kings would be greedy and bad.  They wouldn't care about their people.  Everything would seem upside down.  The good would be treated badly.

But Muni Markandeya also said that this bad time wouldn't last forever.  After a very long time, a great hero named Kalki would come. Kalki would be a very good and powerful warrior. He would make everything good again, and a new, better time would begin!  Then everyone would be good and happy again.
