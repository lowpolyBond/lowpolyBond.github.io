Once upon a time, a wise man named Kausika met a clever woman. She told him about a special hunter in Mithila who knew all about being good.  Kausika believed her.  He decided to go to Mithila to find this hunter.

Mithila was a big, beautiful city! It was full of happy people, lots of colorful flags, and exciting festivals. Kausika looked everywhere for the hunter.  Finally, he asked some people, and they pointed him towards a butcher's shop.

There, Kausika saw the hunter selling meat! He was surprised. This wasn't what he expected from a wise, virtuous man.  The hunter saw Kausika and greeted him warmly. He knew why Kausika had come.

The hunter invited Kausika to his home.  Kausika was worried; he thought selling meat was wrong.  But the hunter explained.  He said his family had always been hunters.  He didn't kill the animals himself; he just sold the meat others had killed.  He lived a simple life, always telling the truth and being kind.

The hunter then taught Kausika about being good. He said being good meant:

* **Being honest:** Always telling the truth.
* **Being kind:** Helping others and not hurting anyone.
* **Being fair:** Treating everyone equally.
* **Working hard:** Doing your job well, no matter what it is.
* **Controlling your feelings:** Not getting angry or greedy.

The hunter also explained that even if your job isn't perfect, you can still be a good person by being kind and honest.  He said that kings should be fair and just, and if they arenâ€™t, bad things happen to their people.

The hunter talked about how important it was to do good things, and to be sorry if you do something wrong. He said that even if you make a mistake, you can always try to be better next time.  He emphasized that true goodness comes from inside your heart.

Kausika learned a lot from the hunter. He understood that being good wasn't just about what you do, but also about how you think and feel. He learned that even someone with a seemingly "bad" job can be a truly good person.  He left Mithila a much wiser man, filled with the hunter's lesson about true virtue.
