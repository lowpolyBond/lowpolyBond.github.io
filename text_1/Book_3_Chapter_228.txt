Once upon a time, there was a very special baby named Skanda.  He was incredibly handsome! He wore a golden crown and shiny earrings. His eyes sparkled like gold, and he had a bright red outfit.  Everyone loved him—even the gods!

The Goddess of Fortune, who looked like a beautiful lotus flower, came to be with him.  Suddenly, Skanda was very lucky. He shone like the full moon!

Wise old men, called Maharshis, came to see him.  "You were born just six days ago, but the whole world loves you already!" they said. "You should be Indra, the king of the gods!"

Skanda asked, "What does Indra do?"

The Maharshis explained, "Indra is strong and powerful. He helps everyone, protects the good, and punishes the bad. He even helps the sun and moon when they need it!"

They wanted Skanda to be the new Indra. But Skanda was humble.  "No," he said, "Indra, the current king, is good. I will be his helper."

Indra, the current king, agreed.  "You are so strong! Please help me fight the bad guys," he said. Skanda happily agreed to lead the army of gods.

The gods were very excited! They gave Skanda a beautiful golden wreath and a red umbrella that looked like fire.  Even Parvati, the goddess, came to celebrate.  Skanda’s father was the powerful Fire-God, Rudra. This is why people sometimes call him Rudra's son.

Skanda had a cool red rooster on his chariot. It looked like a tiny firebird! He was brave, kind, and strong. He always helped others.

Then, Indra told Skanda about a beautiful lady named Devasena. "She is meant to be your wife," Indra said.  They had a wonderful wedding, with lots of music and dancing.

From that day on, Skanda was a great hero. The fifth and sixth days of the moon became special days to celebrate Skanda and his success.  And he lived happily ever after, helping everyone and always being a loyal friend to Indra.
