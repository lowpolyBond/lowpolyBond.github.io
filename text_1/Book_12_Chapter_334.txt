Once upon a time, there was a very special boy named Suka.  He was the son of a wise man named Vyasa.  Suka was incredibly good and learned. He did so many good deeds that amazing things happened!

Suka was so good that he became one with Brahma, the creator!  The sky lit up with shooting stars. The ground shook.  Trees lost their branches, and even mountains crumbled! Loud booms echoed like thunder. The sun dimmed, and the rivers and seas churned. It rained beautifully scented rain, and a lovely breeze blew.

Suka flew through the sky. He saw two giant mountains, one gold and one silver, joined together. They were HUGE, each as wide and tall as many, many miles!  Suka, without fear, flew right through them!  The mountains cracked in two! The sky filled with happy sounds and beautiful flowers rained down.

Suka then saw a beautiful river called Mandakini, with lovely water nymphs playing. The nymphs felt shy when they saw Suka, because he was so pure and holy.

Suka's father, Vyasa, loved him very much. He saw what Suka had done and followed him through the sky. Vyasa was amazed by his sonâ€™s amazing powers!  When Vyasa called out to Suka, Suka answered with just one sound: "Bho!"  The whole world echoed that sound, "Bho!"  Even today, when you hear echoes in the mountains, it's said to be Suka answering his father.

Suka had become so powerful that he was everywhere at once.  Vyasa was sad that his son was gone, but then the great god Shiva came and comforted him. Shiva said that Suka's goodness would be remembered forever.  Shiva even gave Vyasa a shadow of Suka to always be with him.

Vyasa was happy again.  He knew Suka had reached a wonderful place, a place where only the best and purest people go.  And that's the story of Suka, the amazing boy who showed everyone the power of goodness!
