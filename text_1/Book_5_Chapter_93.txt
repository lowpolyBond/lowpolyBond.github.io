Krishna, a very wise and kind prince, went to see Vidura. He said, "Vidura, you gave me great advice.  I appreciate it.  I came here because I know Duryodhana, one of the Kuru princes, is very mean. He's making the Kurus and Pandavas, his cousins, fight a big war.  Lots of people will die.

"But I want to stop the war!  Even if I can't completely stop it, I'll still try my best.  That's what good people do. It's also true that just *thinking* about doing something bad isn't as bad as actually *doing* it.  I'll try to make peace between the Kurus and Pandavas. Duryodhana and Karna are the main troublemakers; the others are just following them.  A true friend helps others in trouble, even if it's hard.

"I'll talk to Duryodhana and his friends.  I'll give them good advice.  If they don't listen, that's on them!  I'll have a clear conscience.  I need to try; otherwise, people will say I didn't do anything to stop the war. I'm here to help everyone.

"If I can make peace without hurting the Pandavas, that would be wonderful! If Duryodhana is angry at me, that's okay. Nobody can defeat me!  I'm as strong as a lion fighting a herd of deer!

After saying all this, Krishna, the brave and strong prince, rested on his comfy bed and went to sleep."
