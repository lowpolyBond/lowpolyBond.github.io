Lakshmana was very sad.  His brother, Rama, was going away.  Lakshmana was angry!  He paced back and forth like a grumpy elephant. He growled like a lion.  He looked like a snake ready to strike.

"Brother!" Lakshmana shouted. "This is wrong!  Our father and stepmother, Kaikeyi, are tricking you! They want you to go away to the forest.  They lied! They didn't tell you about their wishes before they started making plans for you to become king. This isn't fair! The younger brother, Bharata, shouldn't be king before you!"

Lakshmana was furious.  "Rama, you are strong!  Don't let them push you around! They are being mean and selfish.  Don't listen to them!  This isn't what dharma, what's right and good, means. Fate isn't everything! We can fight for what's right!"

Lakshmana said, "I won't let this happen! I'll fight anyone who tries to stop you from becoming king.  I'll defeat all their armies!  I'll use my sword and arrows!  I'm strong and brave!"  He promised to protect Rama and their kingdom.

Rama loved his brother.  He wiped away his tears.  "Dear Lakshmana," Rama said gently, "obeying our father is the most important thing.  A good person always listens to their parents."
