Suka asked a very important question.  The wise books, the Vedas, say two different things! They say, "Do everything!" But they also say, "Don't do anything!"  Suka wanted to know:  "Where do people go if they only learn, and where do people go if they only do things?"

Bhishma, a very wise and old warrior, answered. He said, "Suka, there are two paths. One path is like a building – it can be destroyed. This is the path of doing things. The other path is like the sun – it's always there. This is the path of learning and knowing.  These paths are as different as the sky is big!"

Bhishma explained that doing things only makes you have to be reborn again and again. It’s like a never-ending cycle.  But learning and knowing leads to a place where you are free and happy forever!  It's like becoming part of something eternal and unchanging, like the sun or the stars.

Some people only like doing things, but that keeps them stuck in this cycle of birth and death, always getting new bodies.  But people who focus on learning are like someone who gets their water from a river, they don't need a well. They don't need to keep doing things.

Doing things brings happiness and sadness, life and death. But learning leads to a place with no sadness, no death, no getting old – a place of perfect peace! This place is where the great spirit, Brahma, lives. It’s a wonderful place where everyone is happy and kind to each other.

Bhishma said that someone who learns is like the moon at its fullest – always there, even if you can't always see it clearly. But someone who only does things is like the new moon – a tiny sliver that will change. They will be reborn again and again.

Even though our bodies and minds change, there's a special part of us, our soul, that is always there. This soul is part of something bigger, even bigger than Brahma, the creator. This soul learns and grows, and it's the soul that does things.


So, Suka learned that the path of learning leads to lasting peace and happiness, while the path of just doing things keeps you in a cycle of birth, death, and rebirth.
