Once upon a time, King Dushmanta promised a beautiful woman named Sakuntala that he would marry her.  He left, and Sakuntala, all alone, had a baby boy.

This little boy, named Sarvadamana, was very strong.  Even when he was only six years old, he could catch and tie up lions, tigers, bears, buffaloes, and even elephants! He played with them like they were toys!

A wise old man, Kanwa, took care of Sakuntala and her son. When Sarvadamana grew up, Kanwa decided it was time for Sakuntala and her son to go live with the king.

Sakuntala and Sarvadamana, who was now a very handsome young man, went to see King Dushmanta.  But the king didn't recognize her! He said he didn't remember her or their promise.

Sakuntala was very sad and angry. She reminded him of their promise and said, "God sees everything! Everyone knows what you did!" She talked about how important a wife and son are, and how a good king should treat his family. She said that her son was his own reflection, like looking in a mirror!

The king was still confused and didn't believe her. He even said mean things about Sakuntala's family.

Sakuntala was hurt but continued to plead her case.  She talked about truth and how important it was. She told him that abandoning his son was wrong.

Suddenly, a magical voice boomed from the sky! The voice said, "The son is the father reborn.  Dushmanta, this is your son, Bharata!"

The king finally understood. He was so happy! He hugged his son, and he and Sakuntala were reunited.

The king gave his son, Bharata, a wonderful life. Bharata became a great king, a just and strong ruler, known throughout the land.  And he always remembered the importance of family and truth, just like his mother taught him.
