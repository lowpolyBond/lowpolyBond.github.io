Once upon a time, a wise god named Brahma needed someone to take away the lives of all living things.  He asked a kind lady, who was very beautiful, to do this important job.

The lady was scared!  She cried, "Oh, great Brahma, how can I hurt babies, grown-ups, and everyone else?  Their families would be so sad!  I don't want to do anything wrong!"

Brahma said, "You were made for this job, my dear. You must do it. It's necessary."

But the lady was still afraid.  She didn't want to hurt anyone. So she did something amazing.  She prayed and prayed and prayed! She stood on one leg for a super long time! She went without food and even went without talking for many, many years. She did this to show Brahma how much she didn't want to hurt anyone.

After all this time, Brahma talked to her again.  "You must do this job," he said.

The lady still didn't want to. She pleaded with Brahma again. Finally, Brahma understood. He said, "Okay, you won't directly kill anyone.  Your job will be to send sickness.  When people get very sick and die, it will seem like you are taking their lives, but it's really just sickness and old age."

He also said, "Your tears of sadness will turn into diseases.  When people's time comes, their bodies will get sick, and they will die.  You'll be helping to balance things, not hurting anyone."

The lady was relieved! She agreed.  And so it was.  Sickness and old age became how the lady took away lives, and she didn't have to hurt anyone directly.  She helped keep everything in balance.

The king heard this story and felt much better. His son had died, but Brahma told him that his son was now happy in heaven.  It was all part of the natural order of things, even though it was very sad.  The story reminded him that even death is a part of life.
