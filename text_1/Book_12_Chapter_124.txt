Once upon a time, in the land of Hastinapura, a wise king named Yudhishthira wondered about being good. He asked, "Everyone says being good is great, but how do you become good?"

His wise uncle, Bhishma, said, "I'll tell you a story.  Duryodhana, a prince who was very jealous of his cousins, the Pandavas, asked his father, Dhritarashtra, the same question."

Duryodhana had seen the Pandavas' beautiful palace and was very upset. He was envious of their wealth and happiness.  Dhritarashtra asked his son, "Why are you so sad? You are rich, your brothers obey you, and you have everything you could want!"

Duryodhana complained, "Yudhishthira feeds thousands of holy men every day from golden plates!  Their palace is amazing, their horses are magnificent, and they are so rich, it's like they have the treasure of the gods!  I'm so jealous!"

Dhritarashtra said, "If you want to be rich and happy like Yudhishthira, or even more so, you must be good. Being good can help you achieve anything!  Long ago, great kings conquered whole kingdoms just by being good.  Their goodness made people love them."

Duryodhana asked, "But how do I become good?"

Dhritarashtra told him a story about a powerful king named Prahlada.  Prahlada was so good that he even ruled the whole world!  Once, Indra, the king of the gods, wanted to know the secret to happiness. He asked many wise people, until finally, he met Prahlada.

Indra asked Prahlada, "How did you become so powerful and good?"

Prahlada answered, "I don't brag about being king. I respect wise people and always follow their advice. I'm kind, I don't get angry, and I control my feelings. Listening to and following good advice is like drinking sweet honey; it makes me a better person."

Then, a very strange thing happened!  Goodness, Truth, Good Deeds, Strength, and Prosperity all left Prahlada’s body and went to Indra, because Prahlada’s goodness had spread so far.

Dhritarashtra explained that being good means being kind to everyone, in your thoughts, words, and actions.  It means never hurting anyone, helping others, and only doing things that make you proud.

He told Duryodhana, "Even bad people may get rich, but they won't stay rich for long if they are not good.  Be good, and you will be happy and successful!"

Bhishma finished the story, saying, "So, Yudhishthira, be good, and you too will find happiness and success."
