Sumantra, Rama's charioteer, went through the palace.  He passed many guards.  Then he saw strong young men with bows and axes, guarding the queens' rooms.  Older men in red clothes stood guard, too.  They were very polite.

Sumantra told them, "Please tell Prince Rama that I'm here."

The guards told Rama and Sita that Sumantra was waiting.  Rama knew Sumantra was his father's trusted friend. He called Sumantra in.

Sumantra saw Rama sitting on a beautiful golden couch. Rama was handsome, like a king from a story.  Sita, as beautiful as the moon, sat beside him.

Sumantra bowed to Rama and said, "Prince Rama, your father, King Dasharatha, wants to see you in Queen Kaikeyi's room, right away!"

Rama smiled. "I'll go at once!" he said.  He turned to Sita. "My mother Kaikeyi and my father want me to be the king," he explained.  "She wants what's best for me.  My father sent for me.  Today, I'll be the next king!"  He kissed Sita and told her to talk to her friends.

Sita, happy for Rama, wished him luck. She said, “May the gods protect you from all sides!”  Then, she walked with him to the door.

Rama left the palace.  His brother, Lakshmana, waited for him. At the palace gates, Rama's friends cheered for him.

Rama climbed into his amazing chariot. It was shiny and gold, with tiger skins. It made a loud noise like thunder!  Lakshmana rode with him.

Everyone shouted, "Hooray for Rama!" People threw flowers. Women sang happy songs.  They said Sita was lucky to be with Rama.

Rama's chariot went through the city. There were elephants, horses, and lots of people.  Shops were full of beautiful things!  Everyone was excited for Rama to become king.  They knew he would be a good ruler. They hoped he would rule for a long, long time!  Rama rode on, happy and proud, ready to be king.
