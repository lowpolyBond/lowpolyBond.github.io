Once upon a time, high in the mountains, lived a big, strong Salmali tree.  He was so proud!  A wise man named Narada heard the Salmali bragging.  He didn't like how the Salmali was being mean to the Wind God.

Narada told the Wind God, "That Salmali tree is being very rude! He said mean things about you!"

The Wind God was angry.  He was super strong! He flew to the Salmali tree and shouted, "You insulted me! I'm the Wind God, and I will show you my power!"

The Salmali tree laughed. "Go ahead! Show me what you can do! Even if you were stronger than you are, I wouldn't be scared.  I'm smarter than you!"

The Wind God said, "We'll see about that! Tomorrow, I'll show you my strength!"

That night, the Salmali tree thought about what happened. He realized the Wind God *was* much stronger. He had been wrong to brag.  The Salmali thought, "I lied to Narada. The Wind God is much stronger.  I'm smarter than other trees, but the Wind God is stronger than all of us."

The Salmali learned a big lesson that night:  Being smart is great, but being too proud isn't good.  And sometimes, being strong is more important than being smart.
