Once upon a time, in a great battle, Karna saw his friends lying dead. He felt very sad and guilty.  Bhima, remembering how Karna had been mean to him before, got very angry.

Bhima shot many arrows at Karna.  Karna fought back bravely! He shot back even more arrows – seventy golden arrows!  But Bhima kept fighting, shooting one hundred arrows at Karna. Then Bhima broke Karna's bow!

Karna grabbed another bow and shot lots of arrows at Bhima.  Bhima was strong! He killed Karna's horses and driver! Then Bhima broke Karna's *new* bow!

Karna jumped down from his chariot and threw a big club at Bhima. Bhima dodged it with his arrows.  Bhima then shot one thousand arrows at Karna!  Karna fought back hard, even cutting Bhima’s armor!

Bhima was furious! He shot nine arrows that went right through Karna's armor!  Karna, hurt and tired, started to run away.

Duryodhana, Karna's friend, shouted for his other sons to help. They all attacked Bhima, but Bhima was too strong.  He defeated them all with just one arrow each! They fell to the ground.

Karna, seeing his friends dead, felt very sad.  He got a new chariot and kept fighting Bhima. They shot many golden arrows at each other.  They were both brave and strong, like two angry clouds clashing.

Bhima and Karna fought fiercely.  They cut each other’s armor, and their bodies were covered in blood. They fought like two tigers, or two elephants! They were so strong, like two roaring bulls!  They were like two powerful lions, with angry eyes!  They fought like the gods themselves!

Bhima stretched his bow, and shot thousands of arrows at Karna.  Everyone watched as Bhima’s amazing skill amazed even Arjuna and Krishna!  Karna's friends watched, feeling very sad because Bhima was so strong and never gave up.
