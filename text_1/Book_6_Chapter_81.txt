The battle was fierce!  Many soldiers were hurt, covered in blood.  They rested a little, talked about their brave deeds, and then got ready to fight again.

Duryodhana, the prince, was worried.  He was bleeding, too! He went to his grandfather, Bhishma.  "Grandpa," he cried, "our army is HUGE!  We have so many soldiers and flags! But the Pandavas are even stronger! They keep breaking through our lines, hurting our soldiers, and then escaping without a scratch! Bhima is especially scary! He even broke through our strongest line, and his arrows were like deadly sticks. I'm scared, Grandpa! Please help us win!"

Bhishma, a very wise and strong warrior, smiled sadly.  He knew Duryodhana was upset. "Don't worry, my prince," he said. "I'll fight with all my might to help you win. The Pandavas have many allies. They are strong and brave, and they really hate you.  It won't be easy, but I will fight for you until the very end. For you, I'd even fight the gods themselves! I will do everything I can."

Duryodhana felt much better after hearing that.  He shouted, "Let's attack!"

The army roared into action!  There were chariots, horses, elephants, and thousands of soldiers.  It was a dazzling sight!  The elephants were huge and strong.  The soldiers were brave and skilled.  Dust filled the air, making the sun look red.  Flags waved like bright lightning in the stormy sky. The sounds of bows being pulled back were like the roar of the ocean!  Duryodhana's army looked so powerful, like a dark storm cloud ready to unleash its fury.
