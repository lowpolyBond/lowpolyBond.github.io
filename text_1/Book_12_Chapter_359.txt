After fifteen long days, Padmanabha, the Naga king, came home. He'd been helping the sun god! His wife rushed to greet him, washing his feet and taking care of him.  After resting, Padmanabha asked his wife, "Did you remember to pray to the gods and be kind to guests while I was gone?"

His wife smiled.  "Everyone has a job," she said. "Students learn from their teachers. Priests study holy books. Servants listen to their masters. Kings protect their people.  Soldiers protect everyone from harm.  And servants help the priests, soldiers, and farmers.  A good wife is kind and obeys her husband.  That's my job. I prayed to the gods and welcomed guests.  A holy man came fifteen days ago. He’s waiting by the Gomati River. He wants to talk to you. He’s very holy and keeps his promises. He asked me to tell you he's waiting!"

Padmanabha said, "Let's go see this holy man!"
