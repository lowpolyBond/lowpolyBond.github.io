Once upon a time, after a big, sad battle, good King Yudhishthira remembered all the people who died.  He wanted to help them in the afterlife.  So, he gave lots of food and gifts to the priests, to pray for his family and friends who were gone.

King Dhritarashtra, whose sons had died, also gave lots of food, cows, jewels, and riches to the priests, so his sons would be happy in the afterlife, too.

Yudhishthira and his wife, Draupadi, gave many gifts for brave warriors like Karna, Abhimanyu, and Ghatotkacha. They also gave gifts for Drona, Drupada, and even Virata and their families!  They gave so many gifts to the priests – thousands of them!

Yudhishthira also remembered all the other kings and soldiers who died alone. He made sure they were honored too. He built houses where people could get food, places with water to drink, and made big ponds in their memory.  He wanted to show how grateful he was.

He was kind to everyone. He still took good care of his uncles and aunts, Dhritarashtra and Gandhari, and his wise uncle Vidura.  He helped all the women who lost their husbands and sons.  He gave food, clothes, and homes to people who had nothing – the poor, the blind, and anyone who needed help.

Now that the war was over, and he ruled the whole land, King Yudhishthira was finally happy. He was a good and kind king.
