King Dhritarashtra was worried. He asked Sanjaya, his advisor, "Sanjaya, my army was huge!  Why couldn't they stop Satyaki? He was super strong, like the god Indra! Did he just walk through an empty path? He defeated so many soldiers all by himself!"

Sanjaya answered, "King, your army was enormous! It was the biggest army ever!  Even the gods said so!  It was so loud and chaotic, like a huge storm at sea.  There were thousands of kings fighting on both sides!  Bhima, Yudhishthira, Nakula, and Sahadeva shouted, 'Go! Help Arjuna and Satyaki get to Jayadratha!' They urged their soldiers to fight hard, saying, 'If Satyaki and Arjuna die, we lose!' Your soldiers fought bravely, too.  But Satyaki was very strong, and he fought his way through to Arjuna.  The sun shone off the warriors' armor, so bright it hurt their eyes!"

Dhritarashtra then asked, "And what about Duryodhana, my son? He's a king, used to a life of luxury.  Fighting so many alone... I hope he didn't run away!"

Sanjaya said, "King, I'll tell you about Duryodhana's amazing fight. He charged into the Pandava army like an elephant crashing through lotus flowers!  Bhima, the twins, and Yudhishthira rushed to help. Duryodhana shot many arrows. He hit Bhima, the twins, Yudhishthira, and many other heroes.  He was so skilled with his bow; it looked like it was always bending, shooting arrows! But Yudhishthira broke Duryodhana's bow! Then Duryodhana got a new bow and fought on. Drona, your advisor, came to help Duryodhana. The battle was fierce, like a terrible storm, everyone fighting hard.  Arjuna and his men were fighting too, and Satyaki was still battling your soldiers.  The fighting was everywhere!"
