Once upon a time, in a forest, a prince named Kotika met Princess Draupadi.  She was all alone.  She was shy at first.  She said, "It's not proper for me to talk to you like this, but I'm all by myself."

Draupadi explained, "I know who you are!  I'm Princess Draupadi, daughter of King Drupada. My husbands, the five Pandava brothers – Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, and the twins Nakula and Sahadeva – are out hunting. They've split up.  Yudhishthira went east, Bhima went south, Arjuna went west, and the twins went north."

Draupadi smiled. "Please stay! My husbands are very kind and love to have guests.  They'll be so happy to see you when they get back!"  Then, she went into her big house.
