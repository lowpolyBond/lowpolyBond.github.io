King Dhritarashtra was worried about a big war.  His friends, Bhishma and Drona, saw him worry. They went to Duryodhana, who wanted to fight.

"Duryodhana," they said, "Wait!  The Pandavas aren't even ready yet!  Arjuna's amazing bow hasn't even been used.  Bhima, the strong one, isn't even in his fighting position.  He hasn't even swung his big club!  Nakula and Sahadeva, and all the other great warriors, aren't attacking yet. The Pandavas' arrows haven't even begun to fly! There's no fighting going on yet!"

Bhishma and Drona continued, "Let's make peace!  Imagine Yudhishthira, the kind king, hugging you! Think of Bhima, the strong one, giving you a friendly pat on the back. Imagine Arjuna and the twins greeting you nicely. Everyone will be happy!  Let's tell everyone good news - the brothers are friends again! You can rule the kingdom together, like brothers should!"
