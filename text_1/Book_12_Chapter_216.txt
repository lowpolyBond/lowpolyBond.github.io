Long ago, in a land far away, a wise man named Bhishma taught about dreams. He said that dreams are tricky!  When we sleep, our minds play games.  It's like we have a second body in our dreams, and we do things we wouldn't do when we're awake.  Our desires and fears make us act differently.

Bhishma said that people who want to be good and pure should try not to sleep too much.  He explained that dreams happen because our minds are still busy, even when our eyes are closed.  It’s like our mind keeps making up stories!

He said that our dreams are made of things we've seen, heard, felt, and thought about before.  Happy thoughts make happy dreams, and scary thoughts make scary dreams. Sometimes, our dreams show us things from a long, long time ago!  Even if we forget something, our minds remember.  

Bhishma said that some people are very good at controlling their minds. They can stay awake and think clearly, even when they're tired.  They understand that everything – good, bad, and everything in between – is part of the same big, amazing universe.

He said that when we're really, really asleep (not dreaming at all), our bodies and minds rest completely.  It’s like our spirits are taking a break, connecting to something bigger than ourselves.   This is a very special state of being.

Bhishma said that those who want to be wise and good should try to understand their minds.  If we focus on goodness, we’ll have good thoughts. And if we forget the bad stuff and focus on being pure, we'll be closer to understanding the universe.  The best way to do this is by being calm and quiet inside. That inner peace is what allows us to understand everything.  The wisest people understand that being good is a great goal.  It takes time, effort, and a calm mind.
