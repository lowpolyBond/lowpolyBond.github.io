Long ago, after a terrible battle, a sad queen named Gandhari cried.  A wise man told her, "Your son, Duryodhana, was mean and bossy.  He did bad things, and you let him.  Don't blame others for your sadness.  Crying won't help."

The wise man explained that different women have different reasons to have children. A queen, like Gandhari, has sons to be brave warriors. But this great battle caused many deaths.

King Dhritarashtra, Gandhari's husband, asked the good king Yudhishthira how many people died. Yudhishthira said, "One billion six hundred sixty million twenty thousand soldiers died. Only two hundred forty thousand and one hundred sixty-five survived."

Dhritarashtra then wanted to know where all the brave warriors went after they died. Yudhishthira explained:  The brave warriors who fought happily went to a wonderful place. Those who were scared went to a different place. Those who ran away or begged for mercy went to another place.  The bravest warriors, who kept fighting even when hurt, went to the best place of all.  The others went to other places.

Dhritarashtra was amazed.  Yudhishthira said he learned this special knowledge from a wise man in the forest.

Dhritarashtra worried about giving proper funerals to all the dead soldiers. Many had no family. Yudhishthira ordered his helpers to make huge funeral pyres. They gathered wood, oil, and beautiful cloths.  They burned the bodies of all the great warriors: Duryodhana and his brothers, Karna, Abhimanyu, and many, many more.  The fires burned bright all night, like stars in the sky.

After the funerals, Yudhishthira led Dhritarashtra to the river Ganges.
