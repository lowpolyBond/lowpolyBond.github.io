Once upon a time, Duryodhana was worried.  The Pandavas, his cousins, were back!  They had been living in the forest, but now lots of powerful kings were with them.  Even Krishna, a very strong warrior, was helping them!  These kings wanted the Pandavas to get their kingdom back.

Duryodhana was scared. He told his grandpa, the king, "Don't worry, Grandpa! We can win a battle!  But the Pandavas and their friends are mean and want to take everything from us!"

Duryodhana felt very worried. He talked to his strong warriors, Bhishma, Drona, and Kripa. "What should we do?" he asked. "Should we fight?  If we fight, we might lose, because so many kings are helping the Pandavas!"

Bhishma, Drona, and Kripa said, "Don't worry, Duryodhana! We're very strong. We can defeat the Pandavas!" They reminded him how powerful they all were. Bhishma was super strong, he even defeated many kings all by himself long ago.

Duryodhana still felt nervous. He told his grandpa, "My army is HUGE! The Pandavas' army is smaller.  It’s even smaller than ours by more than a third! Even the powerful Krishna won't stop us!"  

Duryodhana was especially proud of his mace-fighting skills. "I'm the best mace fighter ever!" he boasted.  "I can beat Bhima, the Pandava's strongest warrior, easily!  One hit, and Bhima will be done for!"  

He also talked about all his other amazing warriors: Karna, who was almost as strong as Bhishma; and many, many more!  "They’re all amazing, Grandpa!  We will win!" he said.  He was very sure that his army would win.  They had so many great fighters.

Duryodhana was still very curious about what the Pandavas were planning.  He asked his friend Sanjaya to tell him more about the Pandavas. He wanted to know everything they were doing.
