Once upon a time, the wise Vyasa told a story about how people should live. He said that Brahmins (priests) should do certain good things.  If you do good things, good things will happen to you.  

But sometimes people wonder, "Are these good things *really* necessary, or can we choose?" Vyasa said, if the good things help us learn and understand the world, then we *must* do them.

People had different ideas about why we do good things. Some said it was because we try hard. Others said it was because we have to. Some said it was just our nature.  Some said it was a mix of all three!  Some people even had very confusing ideas about whether things existed or not!

But wise people, called Yogis, knew that everything comes from a single source â€“ Brahma.  In the past, people were much better at doing good.  In the very first age, the Krita Yuga, everyone was peaceful and kind. They did special prayers and practices.  They saw that even though the prayers were different, they all led to the same good things.

Doing good deeds, especially through hard work and dedication, helps us achieve our dreams and even become powerful!  The Vedas, holy books, tell us about this, but Brahma is so great that even those who study the Vedas can't fully understand it.  

Different people have different good things to do.  Brahmins meditate, warriors protect people, farmers grow food, and servants help others. If you do your duty and are kind to everyone, you become a good person.

But as time went on, things changed.  In later ages, people became confused about the good things to do. The books became harder to understand, and people did bad things more often. Even nature suffered.

Vyasa said time is like a great river. It never stops. It creates everything, helps it grow, and finally takes it away.  Everything is part of this great river of time.

So, the story ends with the understanding that doing good things, following your path, and being kind are important, no matter what age you live in.
