Once upon a time, a wise man named Sanjaya told King Dhritarashtra a wonderful story about magical islands far, far to the north.

"King," said Sanjaya, "imagine oceans of butter, then oceans of yogurt, then oceans of wine, and finally, a regular ocean!  These oceans surround amazing islands. Each island is twice as big as the one before it!"

On one island was a big mountain made of red rock.  On another island, lived the god Narayana. He guarded sparkling jewels and made everyone happy.  There were other islands with special trees and mountains full of precious gems. Everyone there was very kind and peaceful. They lived forever!  There were no bad people, only happy people with beautiful, shiny skin.

Sanjaya described seven special lands called Varshas.  Everyone in these lands lived a very long time.  The further north you went, the healthier and happier people became.  Their lives were longer, and their morals even better!

Then Sanjaya talked about more islands and mountains, each bigger than the last.  He told the King about more special lands with happy people, gods, and magical creatures. On one island, the great god Prajapati lived. He protected everyone and kept them safe.  Food magically appeared every day, and everyone had enough to eat.

On a faraway island, four giant elephants lived. They were so big, nobody could even measure them! They controlled the wind that blew across the Earth, making sure everyone could breathe.

Finally, Sanjaya told King Dhritarashtra about the sun, moon, and stars.  He explained how big they were, using a special measurement called a yojana.

The King was amazed. Sanjaya said, “King, listening to this story will bring you good luck and happiness!”  And that's the story of the magical islands!
