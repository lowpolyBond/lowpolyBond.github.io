King Dhritarashtra was worried.  He asked his messenger, Sanjaya, "Sanjaya, tell me what Arjuna said after Krishna finished speaking. I'm very curious!"

Sanjaya said, "After Krishna spoke, Arjuna said, 'Sanjaya, tell everyone on the Kaurava side – our grandfather Bhishma, Dhritarashtra, Drona, Kripa, Karna, and many other kings – that they are all about to die! Suyodhana has brought them all here to be killed in battle.  Tell them all I said this, and especially Suyodhana, the meanest of them all! He's greedy and angry! Tell him to listen carefully!'"

Arjuna continued, "'Sanjaya, tell the kings that this is also my message:  Stop this war! Give back what rightfully belongs to Yudhishthira.  If you don't, I will use my arrows to defeat you all! Your soldiers, your elephants, everything – I will send you all to the land of the dead!'"

Sanjaya said, "I bowed to Arjuna and Krishna and hurried here to tell you this important message, my king."
