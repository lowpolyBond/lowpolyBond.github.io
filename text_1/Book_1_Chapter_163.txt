Once upon a time, a scary monster, a Rakshasa, was bothering a poor Brahmin family.  The Rakshasa demanded a human sacrifice! The Brahmin, his wife, and his only child were terrified.

Queen Kunti heard about their trouble.  She was kind and brave.  She had five strong sons.  "Don't worry," she said to the Brahmin. "One of my sons will go instead of you."

But the Brahmin shook his head. "Never!" he cried. "I would rather die than let someone else die for me, especially a holy Brahmin." He explained that killing a Brahmin is the worst thing you can do.  He'd rather die himself than cause such a terrible sin.

Kunti understood.  "I agree," she said. "Protecting Brahmins is very important. But my son Bhima is super strong and brave. He can defeat the Rakshasa!"

She whispered a secret.  "Bhima will trick the Rakshasa. He'll give him the food, but he'll escape safely." She asked the Brahmin not to tell anyone about Bhima's secret power, because it was very special.

The Brahmin and his wife were so happy!  They thanked Kunti.  Kunti then went to Bhima and asked him for help.  Bhima, always ready for an adventure, said, "Yes, Mother! I will go!"  And so, he bravely faced the monster to save the family.
