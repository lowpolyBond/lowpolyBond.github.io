Long ago, a wise man named Bhishma told a story. He said a very old saying went like this:  A girl shouldn't be thought of as something bought and sold.  She should be treated with kindness and respect.

Her dad, brothers, husband, and everyone should treat her nicely and give her pretty things. If they do, everyone will be happy!  If a wife and husband aren't happy, they may not have children.  

Bhishma said women should always be treated with love.  When women are happy, everyone is happy! But when women are sad, bad things happen to the family.  If women are unhappy, the whole family can have problems.  It's like a magic spell gone wrong!

A long time ago, a great king named Manu said that women need men to protect them.  Some women are kind and loving, some are not. But all women deserve respect.  Men's happiness depends on how they treat women. Women help families grow, they take care of babies, and they are important for a happy life. If you honor women, good things happen!

Then, a princess from a faraway kingdom said that a woman's most important job is to be a good wife and be kind to her husband. By doing this, she goes to heaven!  Her dad protects her when she's little, her husband when she's grown, and her sons when she's old.  She's always under someone's care, like a precious flower.

The princess also said that lucky women are like goddesses! If you're kind to women, you're lucky too! But if you hurt them, you hurt your own luck.  Treat women with kindness, and you'll have a happy life!
