Once upon a time, King Nala was a very good king.  But a sneaky man named Pushkara tricked Nala in a game. Pushkara cheated and won everything Nala owned â€“ his kingdom, his riches, everything!  

Pushkara laughed. "Now, all you have left is your wife, Damayanti," he said.

Nala was very angry, but he didn't say anything. He was heartbroken. He took off all his jewelry and clothes, leaving only a simple cloth to wear.  Poor Damayanti, she only had one cloth too, and followed her husband.

They left the city and slept outside for three nights. Pushkara was mean. He told everyone that anyone who helped Nala would be punished. So, no one gave Nala any food.  Nala and Damayanti were very hungry.

One day, Nala saw some beautiful golden birds.  He thought, "I'll eat them!" He tried to catch them with his cloth. But when he lifted his cloth, the birds flew away!  

Then, the birds spoke!  "Silly Nala," they chirped, "we are magic dice! We took your clothes!"

Nala was sad and lost. He pointed to different paths, talking about the places they could go: Avanti, the Vindhya mountains, the Payasvini River, the homes of holy men. He even talked about the Vidarbha and Kosala kingdoms. He was showing Damayanti the way to safety, but he felt so lost himself.

Damayanti was very worried. "My dear husband," she cried, "how can I leave you here, hungry and without clothes?  I won't leave you!"

Nala said, "My love, a wife is the best friend a man can have in tough times.  I don't want you to leave, but I don't know what to do."

Damayanti was clever. She realized Nala was confused and sad. She said, "If you don't want me to leave, why are you showing me all these paths? Let's go to my family in Vidarbha. The king there will help you."

And so, Nala and Damayanti, although poor and lost, went to seek help from Damayanti's family.
