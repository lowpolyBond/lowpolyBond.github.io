Once upon a time, a fire god named Agni needed help.  He wanted to burn down a big, big forest called Khandava.  But this forest was protected by powerful gods and creatures!

Agni asked his friend Arjuna, a super strong warrior, for help.  Arjuna said, "I need better weapons!"

So Agni went to see Varuna, the god of the ocean, who had amazing weapons.  Agni asked for a special bow and arrow for Arjuna, and a super-fast chariot pulled by magical horses.  Varuna happily gave them!

The bow, named Gandiva, was the best bow ever! It was so strong and shiny, even the gods worshipped it.  The chariot was amazing too; it was made by the greatest builder in the universe and sparkled like the sun.  It had a scary ape on its flag!

Arjuna got the bow and chariot. He was so happy! He climbed into the chariot, ready for battle. The chariot was so fast it seemed to fly!

Agni also needed a weapon for his other friend, Krishna. Varuna gave Krishna a magical discus that could fly and always come back to him.  He also gave Krishna a powerful club!

Krishna and Arjuna were ready. They told Agni, "We've got your back! Burn the forest!"

Agni roared! He was so excited!  He turned into a huge ball of fire and surrounded the Khandava forest. Flames shot out everywhere!  The forest started to burn, crackling and popping, just like a giant bonfire!  The whole forest became bright and fiery, like a mountain on fire!

And so, with the help of Arjuna and Krishna, Agni finally burned down the Khandava forest.
