Once upon a time, a wise man named Narada told a story about Karna.  Karna was a very strong warrior, almost as strong as Arjuna!  But Karna wasn't born a prince.  He was raised as the son of a charioteer.

Narada said, "Karna was a very powerful warrior, but he was jealous of Arjuna and his friends.  Arjuna was a great archer, and Karna wanted to be just as good, even better!

Karna went to his teacher, Drona, to learn powerful magic weapons. But Drona only taught these weapons to very special people. He refused to teach Karna.

So, Karna pretended to be a Brahmin, a holy man, to learn from another teacher, Rama.  Rama taught Karna many powerful weapons, and Karna became very strong.

One day, while hunting, Karna accidentally killed a holy cow. The cow belonged to a priest who was very angry. He cursed Karna!  The priest said, "When you fight your greatest enemy, the earth will swallow the wheel of your chariot, and your enemy will cut off your head!"

Even though Karna tried to apologize and give the priest gifts, the curse couldn't be undone.  Karna was sad, but he continued to train and become a great warrior, even with this terrible curse hanging over him.  That's the story of Karna, a powerful warrior with a secret past and a terrible curse!"
