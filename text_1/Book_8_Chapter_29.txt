King Dhritarashtra was very sad.  He had heard from his friend Sanjaya about the terrible battle.  "Sanjaya," he said, "my sons, the Kauravas, are probably all gone.  Tell me what happened!  Especially tell me about Duryodhana and Yudhishthira's fight."

Sanjaya said, "King Duryodhana, angry as a poisonous snake, wanted to fight Yudhishthira. He told his driver, “Go! Take me to Yudhishthira!” Yudhishthira, angry like a mad elephant, told his driver, “Go! Take me to Duryodhana!”

The two brothers met.  They were both strong warriors.  They shot many arrows at each other.  Duryodhana broke Yudhishthira's bow!  Yudhishthira, very angry, grabbed a new bow and broke Duryodhana's bow and flag!

They kept shooting arrows.  They fought like angry lions or bulls!  They roared and blew their horns.  Yudhishthira hit Duryodhana three times.  Duryodhana hit Yudhishthira five times!

Duryodhana threw a big, sharp spear, like a burning stick!  Yudhishthira broke it into three pieces with his arrows and then hit Duryodhana five times.  Then Duryodhana hit Yudhishthira nine times!  Yudhishthira was hurt, but he shot a powerful arrow that knocked Duryodhana down.

Duryodhana, still angry, picked up a big club to finish the fight.  But Yudhishthira threw a blazing spear at him, hurting him badly.  Duryodhana fell to the ground, unconscious.

Bhima, Yudhishthira’s brother, said, "Don't kill him, brother!"  So Yudhishthira stopped.  Then another warrior, Kritavarma, came to help Duryodhana.  Bhima fought him.  That's how the afternoon battle ended, with everyone wanting to win!"
