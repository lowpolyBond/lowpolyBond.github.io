Yudhishthira, the king, asked his wise grandfather Bhishma a question.  He wanted to know how a king should rule.  He wondered how a king could make his people happy.

Yudhishthira was worried. He said, "Grandfather, how can a king choose good friends and helpers? If a king has bad friends, his good helpers will leave him. How can a king be successful?"

Bhishma, the wise old man, smiled. "A king can't rule alone," he said. "He needs good helpers!"

He explained, "A good king needs helpers who are:

* **Smart and wise:**  They should be able to think and give good advice.
* **Kind and loyal:** They should care about the king and always be truthful.
* **Well-born and calm:**  They should come from good families and not get easily upset.
* **Helpful and hardworking:** They should always try to help the king and work hard.
* **Honest and trustworthy:** They shouldn't take bribes or be dishonest.

Bhishma said, "A king's helpers should share his happiness and sadness.  They should always want to help him. They should look after the kingdom's money and make sure everyone is treated fairly. The king should be kind and always do what is right."

Bhishma added, "A king who has such helpers will be a successful and happy king!  His people will be happy too, because he will rule justly and wisely."
