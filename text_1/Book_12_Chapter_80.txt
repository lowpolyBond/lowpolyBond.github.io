Once upon a time, in the land of Bharat, a wise king named Yudhishthira asked his grandpa, Bhishma, a very, very wise man, "Grandpa, even small things are hard to do alone. How can a king rule all by himself? How should a king act? Who should he trust, and who should he not?"

Bhishma smiled.  "A king has four kinds of friends," he said. "Friends with the same goals, loyal friends, family friends, and friends he's made by being kind.  There's also a fifth kind â€“ a truly good person who always does what's right. The king should always be careful, especially with friends who only want something from him.  Family and loyal friends are the best, but even them, a king needs to watch carefully!"

Bhishma continued, "Kings sometimes have to do things that aren't always fair.  It's tricky!  A king should always be very careful about who he trusts and never completely trust anyone.  It's like this: a bad person might pretend to be good, and a good person might make a mistake.  Friends can become enemies, and enemies can become friends.  People change!  So a king should always watch what's happening closely."

"Trusting everyone too much is dangerous," said Bhishma. "A truly good friend is happy when you are happy, and sad when you are sad. They want to protect you, always. They worry when you have problems, and celebrate when you are doing well.  A good minister is smart, kind, calm, and always does their best. The king should give only one job to each person; that way things get done better. The best ministers are honest and brave, and always do what is right. They're like your family to help you rule!"

"Your family, though," Bhishma warned, "that's even trickier!  They might not always support you, even though they're family.  Even though family can be tricky, never completely distrust them either. Show them kindness and respect, but be careful! Be kind to everyone, even enemies, and always do your best."  Bhishma smiled. "If a king does all this, he will be a great king, and everyone will remember him forever!"
