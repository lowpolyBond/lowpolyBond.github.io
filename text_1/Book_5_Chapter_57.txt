Once upon a time, before a big battle, King Dhritarashtra asked his advisor, Sanjaya, "Sanjaya, who's fighting for the Pandavas against my sons?"

Sanjaya answered, "Krishna, a very strong warrior, is there!  So are Chekitana and Satyaki. They each brought a huge army! King Drupada and his ten brave sons also came with a giant army to help Yudhishthira. King Virata came too, with his sons and many soldiers.  King Dhrishtaketu and the king of Magadha also joined the Pandavas, each with their own huge armies. Five brothers from Kekaya, with their purple flags and a huge army, are also there to fight for the Pandavas!"

Sanjaya explained how the Pandava army was organized.  "Dhrishtadyumna is leading the Pandavas’ army. He’s a very skilled warrior.  Bhishma will fight Sikhandin. Virata and his army will help Sikhandin.  Bhima will fight Duryodhana and his brothers. Arjuna will fight Karna and Jayadratha, and many other strong warriors.  Sahadeva will fight his uncle.  Nakula will fight Uluka and his army.  The Pandavas have carefully planned who will fight whom."

Dhritarashtra cried, "Oh dear! My sons are foolish! They want to fight Bhima!  They’ll all be defeated!  These Pandava warriors are too strong!"

Duryodhana, however, was brave and boastful.  He said, "Father, we are all related!  We can win! Bhishma, Drona, Karna, and many other strong warriors are on our side.  They are invincible! The Pandavas will lose!"

Dhritarashtra worried, "My son talks like a madman!  Even Bhishma is afraid of the Pandavas. Who’s making these mighty warriors so eager to fight?"

Sanjaya replied, "Dhrishtadyumna is encouraging the Pandavas. He’s saying, ‘Fight bravely! Don’t be afraid!  I can take on all of Duryodhana’s army!’ Yudhishthira trusts Dhrishtadyumna completely. Dhrishtadyumna even sent a message to Duryodhana's army saying, ‘Don’t fight Arjuna! He’s too powerful!  Surrender instead!’"
