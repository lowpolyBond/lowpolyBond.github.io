Bhishma, a wise old warrior, told the king about the Pandavas' amazing army.  "The Pandavas are incredibly strong!" he said.  "Yudhishthira, their leader, is a great warrior.  Bhima is like eight warriors in one! He's super strong, like ten thousand elephants!  The twins, Nakula and Sahadeva, are also strong warriors, as handsome as gods.  All the Pandava brothers are tall and brave, like lions!"

Bhishma continued, "They've trained hard their whole lives. They're faster and stronger than anyone.  They even beat everyone when they were kids! They once won a big contest, the Rajasuya sacrifice, right in front of you! Remember how angry they were after losing a game and Draupadi was mistreated?  They'll be furious in battle."

Then Bhishma talked about Arjuna, the best warrior of them all. "Arjuna, with Krishna driving his chariot, is unbeatable!  He has a magical bow, Gandiva, and amazing arrows.  He has amazing armor and weapons from the gods! He's even fought and won against thousands of demons!  Even gods, giants, and other magical beings have never seen a warrior like him!  Only Drona and I, and no one else, can even try to fight Arjuna!"  Bhishma sighed, "He's young and strong, while Drona and I are old.  He'll defeat your army easily."

The king's advisors heard Bhishma's words.  They were scared. Thinking of the Pandavas' strength, their strong arms felt weak and heavy.  They were terrified of the coming battle.
