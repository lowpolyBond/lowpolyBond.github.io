Once upon a time, a wise king named Yudhishthira asked a very clever man, Bhishma, a big question: "Which is more powerful, what we do ourselves, or our destiny?"

Bhishma said, "Let me tell you a story!  Long ago, a great wise man named Vasishtha asked the mighty god Brahma the same question."

Brahma answered, "Imagine a plant. It needs a seed to grow, right? A good seed makes a good plant, a bad seed makes a bad plant.  No seed, no plant!  Our actions are like the soil, and our destiny (what happened in our past lives) is like the seed.  Both are needed for a good harvest."

Brahma explained, "If you work hard and do good things, you'll have a good life. If you are lazy and do bad things, you'll have a bad life.  Even the gods and goddesses worked hard to become powerful!  A brave warrior becomes strong, a farmer works hard to grow food, and even God himself works hard!"

Brahma gave many examples. Some people did good things but still had bad luck.  Others did bad things and were punished.  Even powerful kings and brave heroes sometimes failed because they didn't keep working hard and being good.

Brahma said, "Destiny is like a little fire.  It's small. But if you add hard work, it becomes a big, powerful fire!"

So Bhishma told the king, "Itâ€™s not just destiny! Hard work is also very important.  Both our hard work and our destiny work together to shape our lives."  The king understood that he needed to work hard to have a good life, not just rely on luck.
