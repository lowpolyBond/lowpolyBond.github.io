Once upon a time, a holy man, a Brahmana, came to a forest.  He was waiting for the Naga King, a powerful snake-king.  He didn't eat anything while he waited!

The Nagas, who were snake people living in that forest, were very worried.  They saw the Brahmana sitting quietly, not eating for days.  The Naga King's family – his wife, children, and brother – all went to see him.

They found the Brahmana sitting by the Gomati River. He was very still, saying special words quietly. The Nagas bowed to him.  "Holy man," they said, "you've been here for six days without eating!  Please, have some food!  We are the Naga King's family. It's our duty to take care of you. We offer you fruits, roots, water, rice, or even meat.  All the Nagas are worried about you!  We would never hurt a holy man."

The Brahmana smiled. "Because you asked so nicely," he said, "I will almost break my fast. But I'm waiting for the Naga King.  If he doesn't come back in eight more days, then I will eat. This fast is only because I respect the Naga King. Don't worry about me!  Go back home."

The Nagas went home, feeling much better.  They knew the Brahmana's fast was all for their king.
