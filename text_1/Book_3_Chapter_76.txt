Once upon a time, King Nala was lost and changed! His beautiful wife, Damayanti, missed him terribly. She sent her friend, Kesini, to find him.

Kesini found someone who looked like Nala, but Damayanti wasn't sure.  She wanted to see him herself. She asked her parents if she could meet him.  They said yes.

When Nala and Damayanti finally saw each other, they both cried.  Damayanti was sad and dirty. She asked Nala, "Did you really leave me alone in the forest?"

Nala explained, "A bad spirit, Kali, made me do it.  But I fought him and I'm free now! I came back for you."

Damayanti was scared someone was trying to trick her.  She said, "Only my true husband can travel a hundred miles in one day!"

To prove he was Nala, Nala showed everyone that he could travel really, really far in one day. The wind even helped prove Damayanti had done nothing wrong.

Everyone was so happy!  The sky rained flowers and magical music played.  Nala was back to his normal self. Damayanti hugged him tight. They cried happy tears.

They told everyone what happened in the forest.  Damayanti's father, King Bhima, welcomed Nala back. That night, they talked and talked about their adventures.

After four long years, Nala and Damayanti were finally together again! They lived happily ever after in the palace, and everyone celebrated their reunion.  Damayanti was as happy as a flower after a rainstorm.
