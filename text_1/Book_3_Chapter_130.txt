Long ago, a wise man named Lomasa told a king a wonderful story.  He said, "King, this is a special place!  If people die here, they go straight to heaven!  Many, many people come here to die peacefully."

He explained that a long time ago, a powerful god named Daksha blessed the land. He said, "Anyone who dies here will go to heaven!"

"Look," said Lomasa, "there's the beautiful Saraswati River!  But see, it disappears into the ground near the Nishadas' land.  The river hid itself so the Nishadas couldn't see it.  Then, further on, the river appears again! Many other rivers join it on its way to the sea."

He pointed to other special places.  There was Sindhu, where a wise woman named Lopamudra married a great sage.  There was Prabhasa, a place loved by the gods, where all sins are washed away. There was Vishnupada, a very holy place.  And the Vipasa River, where a wise man named Vasistha became free from his troubles after praying there.

Lomasa showed the king a place called Kasmeera, where wise people often visited. He told the king about a meeting between a god of fire and a wise man, and another meeting with a prince and some other wise men.

"Look over there," Lomasa said, "that's the entrance to Manasasarovara Lake.  Rama, a very strong hero, made a path through the mountains to reach it. Near there is Vatikhanda, close to the kingdom of Videha."

He continued, "Every long, long time, the great god Shiva, with his wife Uma, appears here.  People come to this lake and pray to Shiva in the month of Chaitra to be safe and happy.  If you wash yourself here, your sins will be washed away too!"

Then Lomasa pointed out more special places: Ujjanaka, where wise people found peace, and Kausava Lake with its beautiful lotuses.  He even showed the king Rukmini's hermitage, where she found peace.

Lomasa asked the king if he'd heard of Bhrigutunga, a wise man who meditated there.  He showed him the Vitasta River, its cool water washing away sins.  He also showed him the Jala and Upajala rivers beside the Yamuna.

Finally, Lomasa told a story about King Usinara.  He had a special ceremony, and even the gods Indra and Agni came to see it! Indra became a hawk and Agni a pigeon.  The frightened pigeon flew to the king for protection! The king was so good that even the gods wanted to help him.
