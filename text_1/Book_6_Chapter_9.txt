King Dhritarashtra was worried.  He asked his advisor, Sanjaya, "Sanjaya, tell me about this land, Bharatavarsha. My son, Duryodhana, really wants it.  The Pandavas want it too!  It's making me very upset."

Sanjaya said, "King, it's not the Pandavas who are greedy. It's Duryodhana and his friend Sakuni, and many other kings. They all want this land, and they don't get along!"

Sanjaya then told Dhritarashtra about Bharatavarsha.  He said, "It's a special place!  Many great kings ruled it before. It's loved by the gods!"

He described the amazing mountains:  Mahendra, Malaya, Sahya, and many more!  He talked about rivers: the Ganga, the Yamuna, the Saraswati, and so many others – lots and lots of rivers!  Many different people lived there.

Sanjaya then listed many, many kingdoms. There were the Kurus, the Pandavas, the Kalingas, the Matsyas, and so many more! He named so many, it's hard to remember them all!  He said there were kingdoms in the north, the south, the east, and the west.

Finally, Sanjaya said, "This land is like a magical cow! It gives people everything they need: food, happiness, and good things.  Kings fight for it because they want all that it offers.  That's why the Kurus and Pandavas are fighting—they both want Bharatavarsha!"
