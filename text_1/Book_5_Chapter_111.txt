Garuda, a powerful bird, told a wise man named Galava about a special place: the North.  He said, "The North is a very good place! It keeps people away from bad things and helps them be happy forever. That's why it's called the North, which means 'best' or 'highest'."

Garuda explained that the North is also like a center, with all the treasures spread out east and west.  Only good people can live there – kind, gentle, and fair.

In the North, in a place called Vadari, live very important gods: Krishna, Jishnu (another name for Krishna), and Brahman, the creator.  Lord Shiva, who is very powerful and bright, lives on Mount Himavat with his wife, Parvati.  Only a few special people can see him.

The moon was given its power in the North.  The River Ganga fell from the sky to the earth in the North.  Parvati did special prayers there to become Shiva's wife.  Kuvera, the king of the treasures, lives there, too!  The North also has amazing gardens, beautiful rivers like the Mandakini, and a magical mountain called Mandara.  Many happy gods and wise people live in the North, including the seven great sages and their wives.

Garuda said some very good, truthful people called Dharma guard the source of the River Ganga.  Nobody knows exactly how they live, but anyone who tries to pass them will be in danger!  Only the powerful gods Krishna and Jishnu have ever passed them.

Kuvera lives in his palace on Mount Kailasa in the North.  The North is where Vishnu took three giant steps to win a big battle – leaving a special footprint!  A king named Marutta had a big party there, and a wise man named Jimuta gave away all his gold to good people.  Even the gods who rule the world come to the North every day and ask, “What can we do to help?”

Garuda finished by saying, "That's why the North is the best place! It's special and important.  Now, where would you like to go? I can take you anywhere!"
