Once upon a time, there lived a kind king. He had a wonderful son named Rama. Rama was very good and always did what was right.  But the king made a sad mistake. He sent Rama, his wife Sita, and his other son Lakshmana to live in the forest for fourteen years.

Queen Kaushalya was very upset.  She cried and cried. "My dear King," she said, "you're known all over the world for being kind. But how will my poor Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana live in the forest? Sita is used to a comfortable life! She'll miss her soft bed and delicious food. How will she eat wild plants instead of tasty meals?  How will they sleep on the hard ground instead of a soft bed?  How will Rama, strong as he is, not fight for what is right?"

She worried about Rama.  "How will he bear the loud sounds of the wild animals instead of beautiful music? When will I see my Rama again? My heart is breaking!"

The queen was very angry. "Rama is so strong and brave! He could easily take back the kingdom! But he is too good to do that! He would never do anything wrong!  He wouldn't take something that isn't his!"

The Queen felt the king had made a terrible decision.  "You have hurt me, you have hurt our family, and you have hurt everyone in the kingdom," she cried.

The king felt very bad. He listened to his queen's sadness. He was so heartbroken that he fainted and fell to the ground.  He felt terrible for what he had done.
