Once upon a time, a wise bird-catcher talked to a very important Brahmin priest.  The bird-catcher said, "Sometimes, even good people have to tell little white lies.  For example, if someone's life is in danger, or if it helps someone get married, it's okay to not tell the whole truth.  What's really important is doing what's best for everyone.  Sometimes what seems like a lie helps make things better, and sometimes what seems like the truth actually hurts."

He continued, "People always get what they deserve.  If someone is mean, bad things might happen to them.  But it's not always fair!  Sometimes good people have bad luck, and bad people get lucky. Smart, hard-working people sometimes fail, while lazy people sometimes succeed.  Babies born to rich parents might grow up to be bad, while babies born to poor parents might become kind and successful. Sickness and trouble come from what we've done before. Doctors can help with sickness, but the real cause is something else."

The bird-catcher explained, "Everything happens because of what we did in a past life.  People don't really die; they just change bodies.  It's like changing clothes.  If you're kind, you'll be reborn as someone good.  If you are mean, you'll be reborn as someone mean.  If you're very, very good, you might become a god! If you're really bad, you might become an animal, or even worse."

The Brahmin asked, "How does this work?"

The bird-catcher said, "It's a big mystery, but basically, when you die, your actions follow you into your next life.  Good actions lead to good things. Bad actions lead to bad things.  It's like a cycle.  If you keep doing bad things, you'll keep suffering. But if you become good and kind, then one day you'll go to a wonderful place where there is no suffering."

The bird-catcher told him, "To be happy, we should be kind and do good things.  We should learn to control our desires and be honest.  Wise people know this, and they try their best to be good. Theyâ€™re happy in this life and the next."  The Brahmin understood and was happy to learn about this great mystery.
