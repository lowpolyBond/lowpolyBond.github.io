Once upon a time, the gods and the demons (Asuras) fought a big battle!  The demons, wearing strong armor and carrying scary weapons, attacked the gods.

But Lord Vishnu, a very powerful god, had a clever plan. He changed into a beautiful woman and tricked the demons!  He stole the Amrita, a magical drink that made people immortal (live forever).

The gods were so happy! They quickly drank the Amrita.  But sneaky Rahu, a demon, disguised himself as a god and tried to drink it too!

The sun and moon saw Rahu. They told Vishnu, who quickly chopped off Rahu's head with his special flying disc!  Rahu's head flew up into the sky and still makes trouble today – that’s why we have eclipses!

The battle raged on! The gods and demons threw spears, swords, and all sorts of weapons at each other.  It was a very messy fight!  Many demons were hurt and fell to the ground. It looked like a field of red mountains!

Then Vishnu and his friend Nara joined the fight. Vishnu used his super-powerful flying disc, which spun around and defeated lots of demons.  It was like a blazing fire!

The demons were strong, though. They threw huge mountains from the sky!  The earth shook!  But Nara used his special arrows to turn the mountains into dust.

Finally, the gods won! They were very happy. They put everything back in place, and went home to celebrate. They gave Vishnu the Amrita to keep safe.  And that’s how the gods won the great battle!
