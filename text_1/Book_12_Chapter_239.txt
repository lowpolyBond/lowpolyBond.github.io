Once upon a time, a wise young man named Suka asked his grandfather, Vyasa, a very important question.  Suka wanted to know how to find Brahma, the great spirit that is everywhere.  He wondered if it was through hard work, studying, giving things up, or using special knowledge.

Vyasa smiled. He said, "My dear Suka, you find Brahma by learning, working hard, controlling your wants, and letting go of things you don't need."

Vyasa then explained something amazing. He said our bodies are made of the earth, water, light, air, and space.  He said different parts of our bodies are connected to different powerful beings: our feet to Vishnu, our arms to Indra, and our stomach to Agni (the god of fire!).

He said our senses (seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, and touching) help us understand the world. Our mind controls our senses, like a driver controlling a chariot.  Our wisdom guides our mind.

Vyasa said that inside everyone, there's a special part, the soul.  It's not our body; it's something much bigger and more powerful. It's like a tiny light inside, and you can see it by using your mind.

The soul is everywhere. It's in the cow, the elephant, even the dog!  When you see the soul in everything, and everything in your soul, you understand Brahma.  It's like seeing yourself in a mirror, but the mirror shows everything in the world.

Vyasa said it takes a long time and lots of hard work, but if you keep looking with a kind heart and open mind, you'll find Brahma within yourself.  Then you will understand everything and live forever.  Brahma is everywhere, in everything, but it isn't something you can simply touch or see; it is something you understand with your heart.
