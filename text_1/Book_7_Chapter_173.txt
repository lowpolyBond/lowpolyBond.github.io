Once upon a time, during a great battle, Karna, a strong warrior, shot many arrows at Dhrishtadyumna.  Dhrishtadyumna fought back! He yelled, "Wait! Wait!"  They showered each other with arrows.  Then Karna was very powerful; he even killed Dhrishtadyumna’s chariot driver and horses!

Dhrishtadyumna, brave even without his chariot, jumped down and grabbed a club. He fought back and killed Karna’s horses!  He quickly hopped onto Arjuna's chariot, but King Yudhishthira told him to stop fighting.

Karna shouted loudly, blew his horn, and kept fighting.  Seeing Dhrishtadyumna losing, other warriors rushed to help, wanting to defeat Karna.

Karna’s driver got him new, fast horses.  Karna fought like a storm, shooting arrows everywhere. The enemy warriors fell off their horses, elephants, and chariots. He cut off arms and legs!  Everyone was so scared, they ran away even if they weren't hurt!  They were so frightened, they thought everything was Karna!

Yudhishthira saw his army running and was worried. He said to Arjuna, "Look at Karna! He’s like a scary god, burning everything!  Our friends are getting hurt! Karna is shooting arrows so fast, there’s no time to react. He'll kill everyone!  What should we do?"

Arjuna said to Krishna, "Yudhishthira is scared of Karna! Our army is running away.  I can't stand watching Karna win. We need to stop him!"

Krishna said, "Arjuna, only you or Ghatotkacha can defeat Karna now.  But Karna has a very powerful weapon, a special arrow, kept for you.  It’s time for Ghatotkacha to fight Karna!"

Ghatotkacha, a strong and magical warrior, said, "I’ll fight Karna! I’ll fight anyone! Tonight, I’ll fight like the world has never seen!  I won’t spare anyone!"

Ghatotkacha charged at Karna.  Karna smiled and fought back. Their battle was huge and noisy, like a fight between gods!
