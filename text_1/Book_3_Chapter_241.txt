Once upon a time, in the land of Bharatavarsha, a great war was brewing.  King Yudhishthira, a kind and honorable man, saw some of his cousins, the Kauravas,  who were his enemies,  captured by the Gandharvas, some magical warrior beings.  The Kauravas were scared and asked for help.

Yudhishthira was worried. He told his brother Bhima, "Bhima, look!  These are our family, even though we fight sometimes. It's not right for strangers to hurt them like this! The Gandharva king is being mean. He knows we're here, but he captured our cousins and even insulted our family's women. That’s not fair!  We must help them!"

Yudhishthira pointed to many shiny war chariots.  "These chariots are ready.  Arjuna, the twins (Nakula and Sahadeva), and you, Bhima – go fight the Gandharvas and rescue Duryodhana and the others!  Even a normal warrior would help someone asking for help, and we are mighty warriors! A great warrior should do this. It's even better than getting a gift or a son. It’s the best joy of all!”

Yudhishthira said he couldn't fight himself because of a promise he made. “But,” he said, "try talking first, Bhima.  If talking doesn't work, have a little fight. If they still don't let our cousins go, then fight with all your strength!"

Bhima's brother, Arjuna, the greatest archer in the world, said, “If the Gandharvas don't free the Kauravas peacefully, they will pay the price! Today the ground will drink their king's blood!”

When the Kauravas heard Arjuna's brave words, they felt much better. They knew they would be saved!
