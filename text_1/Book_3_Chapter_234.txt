Once upon a time, the Pandava brothers – Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, and the twins – lived in a forest.  It was a hard life.  They had to face hot summers, cold winters, and strong winds.

After they found a beautiful lake and woods, they built a home far away from other people.  They explored the lovely mountains and rivers.  Wise holy men often visited them, and the brothers were very respectful.

One day, a very good talker visited them. After chatting, he went to see the King, Dhritarashtra, the Pandavas’ uncle.  The talker told the king how sad the Pandavas were. They were thin and weak from sleeping on the hard ground, hungry and tired.  Even Draupadi, their wife, was suffering.

The king was very, very sad. He thought about his nephews. Yudhishthira, the eldest, used to sleep on soft beds and wake up to beautiful music. Now, he slept on the ground and was woken by birds!  Bhima, strong as he was, slept on the hard earth, too! Even Arjuna, the best archer, was sad and couldn't sleep well.  The twins were also unhappy.

The king felt terrible because of how badly he’d treated them.  He was worried for all his sons and grandsons. He was afraid of what would happen next. He wondered if all of this was just fate. He remembered how his sons, especially Duryodhana, had cheated the Pandavas in a game, taking away their kingdom.

The king was particularly worried about Bhima's anger.  He was also proud of Arjuna's strength and skill with his bow, the Gandiva.  Arjuna, he knew, could defeat any enemy.

The talker went and told Duryodhana, the king's cruelest son, everything. Even Duryodhana felt a little sad, even though he wasn't a very nice person.
