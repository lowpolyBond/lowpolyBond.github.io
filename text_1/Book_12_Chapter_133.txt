Once upon a time, a wise old man named Bhishma gave some very important advice to a king.  He said, "A king needs a lot of money!"

"Where does the king get this money?" Bhishma asked. "From his own kingdom, and even from his enemies!  This money makes his kingdom strong and powerful.  He needs to keep it safe and try to get even more."

Bhishma explained that being too nice or too mean won't help. The king needs to be fair.  A king without money is weak. A weak king can't rule!  And a king without a kingdom can't be happy.  A strong king has lots of money, soldiers, and friends.

"People ignore a poor king," Bhishma said.  "His servants don't work hard. But a rich king gets respect. His money hides even his mistakes, like a beautiful dress hides things you shouldn't see!"

Even enemies become friendly when a king becomes rich!  They might pretend to be loyal, even though they want to hurt him.  But a wise king knows this.

Bhishma also said, "A king must be strong and brave. He should never give up! It's better to live in the forest with animals than to rule over dishonest people."  Even forest robbers can become soldiers if the king is smart!

But a king also needs to be fair.  He should make good rules so his people are happy.  Even small rules make people happy.  The king shouldn't trust people who don't believe in anything good.

Bhishma said even robbers have rules! They might steal things, but they usually don't kill people or hurt women and children. They don't betray their friends or take things from the poor.  Smart kings don't just kill all the robbers.  They try to make them part of the kingdom. That way, everyone is safer. Killing robbers only makes other robbers angry and scared!  Being kind and smart is always the best way to be strong.
