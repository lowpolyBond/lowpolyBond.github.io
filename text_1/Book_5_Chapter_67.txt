Once upon a time, in the land of Kuru, there was a big meeting of kings.  Duryodhana, a naughty prince, didn't listen to wise Sanjaya.  The other kings got upset and went home.

King Dhritarashtra, Duryodhana's father, was worried. He loved his son very much and always listened to him. He secretly asked Sanjaya, "Sanjaya, tell me!  Who will win the war â€“ my army or the Pandavas, who are our enemies?  Tell me their strengths and weaknesses."

Sanjaya said, "King, I won't tell you secretly.  It might make you angry with me. Let's call your wife, Gandhari, and your wise father-in-law, Vyasa.  With them here, I'll tell you everything."

So, Dhritarashtra sent for Gandhari and Vyasa.  Vidura, a very good man, brought them to the meeting.  Vyasa, who was very wise, said, "Sanjaya, tell King Dhritarashtra everything he wants to know about the Pandavas and their leader, Krishna."

And so, Sanjaya told the King the truth about who was stronger and who was weaker, and what each side was planning.
