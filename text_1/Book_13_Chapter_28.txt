Long ago, there was a wise man named Matanga.  He wanted to be a Brahmin, the highest kind of person.  He was very determined! He listened to the great god Indra, but he didn't listen very well.

Indra, the king of the gods, told Matanga, "Being a Brahmin is very hard! It's not something you can just wish for.  You're not a Brahmin now. If you keep trying, you'll only hurt yourself."

But Matanga didn't listen! He stood on one leg for a whole hundred years!  He wanted to be a Brahmin so badly.

Indra came back and said again, "Matanga, you can't be a Brahmin. It takes a very, very long time! Even if you're very good, you'll have to be reborn many times. You'd first become a normal person, then a low-caste person. Then, after thousands of years of being reborn and being good, you might become a farmer.  After many more thousands of years, you might become a warrior.  Then, after even longer, you might become a low-level Brahmin. It takes ages and ages! Each step takes longer and longer."

Indra explained that even if Matanga somehow became a high Brahmin, he'd still have to fight bad feelings like anger and greed. If he lost that fight, he'd fall down and lose everything.  

Indra said, "Matanga, please ask for a different wish!  Becoming a Brahmin is impossible for you right now."  Matanga finally understood and asked for a different wish.
