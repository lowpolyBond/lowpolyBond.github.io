Vipula was a very, very good student.  He did exactly what his teacher told him. Then he did super hard exercises to become extra strong and good.  Everyone thought he was amazing! He felt like he could do anything!

One day, there was a big party for Ruchi's sister.  Beautiful flowers, that smelled like heaven, fell from the sky. Ruchi picked some up and put them in her hair.  Her sister, the queen, wanted some too!

Ruchi asked her husband, a wise teacher named Devasarman, to get some more flowers.  Devasarman told Vipula, "Go get those special flowers!"

Vipula went to where the flowers had fallen. He found more, beautiful and fresh. He was so happy to have found them! He rushed to the city to give them to his teacher.

On the way, Vipula saw two people arguing. They were walking hand-in-hand in a circle, but one stepped faster, breaking the circle. They were so mad, they promised that whoever was lying would have the same bad ending as Vipula in the next life!

Then, Vipula saw some men playing a game with fancy dice.  They also argued and made the same promise!  They said whoever cheated would have the same bad end as Vipula!

Vipula was sad. He couldn't figure out why anyone would wish him a bad end. He thought and thought. Then he remembered something!  He had once protected his teacher's wife from a bad guy.  He had gotten very close to her to hide her, but he never told his teacher what happened!

That was his secret! That was his little mistake! He felt very bad about it.  Finally, he got to the city, gave the flowers to his teacher, and bowed down to show how sorry he was.  He was always respectful to grown-ups.
