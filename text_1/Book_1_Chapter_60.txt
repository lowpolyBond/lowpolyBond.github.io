Once upon a time, a king named Janamejaya was performing a big, important ceremony.  A very wise man, Vyasa, heard about it. Vyasa was very special. He wasn't born like other people.  He was born on an island in the Yamuna River!  He was so smart, he learned everything very quickly. He even knew the secrets of the universe.

Vyasa was the grandfather of the Pandavas, a very important family.  He was so great that he divided all the holy books into four parts.

When Vyasa arrived at the king’s ceremony, everyone was excited.  Janamejaya gave Vyasa a wonderful golden seat.  The king showed great respect, offering gifts and washing Vyasa’s feet.  Vyasa was very happy.

Then King Janamejaya asked Vyasa a big question.  "Wise one," he said, "you know all about my family, the Kurus and the Pandavas.  They fought a terrible war. Tell me the whole story! What happened?"

Vyasa smiled and asked his student Vaisampayana to tell the story. Vaisampayana knew the story perfectly, because Vyasa had taught him.  He told the king and everyone else about the big fight between the Kurus and the Pandavas, about how it all started, and how so many people died. It was a very long and sad story.
