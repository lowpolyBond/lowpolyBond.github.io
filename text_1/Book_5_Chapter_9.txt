Once upon a time, King Yudhishthira wanted to know why Indra, the King of the Gods, and his queen had so much trouble.  Salya, a wise man, told him a story.

Long ago, a powerful god named Twashtri was very angry with Indra.  To get revenge, Twashtri made a three-headed son! This son was super strong and wanted Indra's throne. He was very good and holy; he prayed all the time.

Indra worried.  If this three-headed son got even stronger, he could take over the whole world! So, Indra tricked the three-headed son. He sent beautiful goddesses to tempt him.  They danced and showed off, hoping to make him forget his prayers.

But the three-headed son was too good! He ignored the goddesses.  They went back to Indra, sad.  Indra was still scared, so he used his powerful thunderbolt to kill the three-headed son.

Indra was sad even though he won! The son was so bright and shiny, even after he was dead! Indra was scared of the son’s powerful glow. Just then, a carpenter came along.  Indra asked him to chop off the three-headed son’s heads.

The carpenter was scared at first. But Indra promised to help him, and the carpenter agreed.  When he cut off the heads, birds flew out! Partridges from one head, quails from another, and sparrows and hawks from the third. Indra was finally safe.

But Twashtri was furious! He created a giant monster named Vritra to get revenge on Indra. Vritra was super strong and fought Indra. Vritra even swallowed Indra whole!

The other gods were scared. They helped Indra escape from Vritra's belly. Then, they fought Vritra again, but Vritra was very powerful.  Finally, they asked for help from Vishnu, another very powerful god.  (That’s a story for another time!)  This is how Indra and his queen faced great trouble, all because of Twashtri's anger.
