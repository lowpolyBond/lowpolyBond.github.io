The battle began!  Yudhishthira, the good king, was shooting arrows.  He saw Duryodhana rushing at him.  "Wait!" Yudhishthira shouted, but Duryodhana shot nine arrows back!  He even hit Yudhishthira's driver!

Yudhishthira wasn't going to let that happen. He shot thirteen shiny gold arrows!  Four arrows hit Duryodhana’s horses, making them fall.  The next arrow knocked off Duryodhana’s driver’s head!  Then, Yudhishthira broke Duryodhana’s flag, his bow, and his sword, with three more arrows.  He hit him with five more arrows, too!  Poor Duryodhana was left standing alone, without his chariot.

Karna, Drona's son, Kripa, and others saw Duryodhana in trouble. They rushed to help!  The Pandava brothers joined the fight to help Yudhishthira.  BOOM! BOOM!  Thousands of trumpets blew!  It was a giant, noisy mess!

Soldiers fought soldiers. Elephants fought elephants!  Chariots crashed into chariots!  Horses kicked and bucked. It was a beautiful, but scary sight – lots of brave warriors fighting with swords, spears, and arrows.  They fought hard, trying to win.  But soon, it became a crazy, wild fight.  Nobody cared who they hurt anymore!

Elephants were super strong! They stomped on horses, and even lifted soldiers up in their trunks and threw them down.  Soldiers ran away, dropping their jewelry.  The elephants even picked up the jewelry with their trunks!  More soldiers tried to kill the elephants.  Many soldiers were hurt, or even killed by the elephants.  Many elephants were hurt too, from spears and arrows.

Soldiers fought each other with fists and hair! They threw each other to the ground and cut off each other's heads.  Many soldiers were killed without even seeing who was hitting them.  The ground was covered in blood and broken weapons. It was a terrible, messy battlefield!

The fighting was so loud, it sounded like a giant river roaring! It was so messy that warriors couldn't even tell who was on their side and who wasn't.  They just kept fighting and fighting, trying to win.  The battle went on and on.  The ground was filled with dead elephants, horses, and soldiers.  It was covered in mud and blood.  It was a very sad day.   Karna fought hard, and so did Arjuna and Bhima.

The sun was high in the sky when the battle raged on, everyone fighting for their side and wanting to be remembered as brave warriors. It was a truly terrible day for everyone involved.
