The battle raged!  Duryodhana's army was running away!  Even when he shouted, his soldiers wouldn't stop.  A big group of Kaurava soldiers, including Shakuni, turned to fight Bhima.

Karna saw the army fleeing. He told Shalya, the King of Madras, "Go and attack Bhima!"  Shalya did as he was told, and his fast horses rushed toward Bhima.

Bhima was furious! He wanted to fight Karna.  He told his friends, Satyaki and Dhrishtadyumna, "Protect King Yudhishthira!  He's in danger.  Radha's son hurt him badly. Today, Karna and I will fight to the death!  Protect the king, and I'll handle Karna!"

Bhima roared like a lion and charged toward Karna! Shalya saw Bhima and told Karna, "Look! That's Bhima!  He's incredibly angry! I've never seen him like this, not even when Abhimanyu or Ghatotkacha died!"

Karna laughed.  "Shalya, you're right! Bhima is brave and strong. He's reckless! When he was hiding in Virata's city, he even killed Kichaka all by himself!  I always wanted to fight Arjuna, but maybe fighting Bhima is just as good! If I beat Bhima, maybe Arjuna will come fight me! Let's do it!"

Shalya said, "Fight Bhima first! Then you can fight Arjuna!"

So the battle began!  Bhima and Karna clashed!  Trumpets and drums boomed. Bhima, full of rage, attacked Karna with his arrows.  Karna shot back, and the arrows flew like rain!  Bhima broke Karna's bow.  Karna hurt Bhima, and Bhima hurt Karna.  Finally, Bhima shot a powerful arrow.  It hit Karna hard, and he fell unconscious onto his chariot.  Shalya took Karna away.

Bhima was victorious! He chased the rest of Duryodhana's army, just like Indra chasing evil giants!
