Long, long ago, some cows were very, very good.  They prayed and did hard work for a hundred thousand years! They wanted to be super special.

They wished for something amazing:  "We want to be the best gift at any party!" they said. "People should feel clean and happy just by touching our poo!  And anyone who gives us away will go to a happy place!"

A powerful magical being heard their wish.  "You shall have it!" he said.  The cows were so happy!  They became very important.

From that day on, people should bow to cows every morning to be lucky!  The cows became protectors of everyone.  Giving away a cow was a very special thing to do.

If you gave a brown cow with a baby cow, nice and clean, you'd go to a special place with the sun!  A spotted cow meant a trip to the moon! A white cow meant seeing the rain god!  Each color cow sent you to a different magical place!

Giving a special cow was like winning a prize.  You could even go to the home of the gods!  If you gave lots of cows, you'd go to heaven! You'd ride a shiny car, and beautiful angels would take care of you. You'd live there for a long, long time â€“ as long as the number of hairs on all the cows you gave!

Then, when your good deeds ran out, you'd be reborn into a wonderful family on Earth. So, cows are very special and important!
