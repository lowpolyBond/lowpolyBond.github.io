King Yudhishthira was worried.  He needed powerful weapons for a big battle.  He asked his wise brother, Arjuna, to go get them from the gods.

Arjuna was super strong and brave, like a tiger! He was also very smart. Yudhishthira knew Arjuna could do it. He was as strong as Krishna, and as wise as the wise Narada!  He even thought Arjuna was like a god himself!

Yudhishthira was also worried about the enemy army.  Bhishma, Drona, Kripa, and Drona's son were amazing warriors.  They were super strong and knew all about fighting.  And then there was Karna!

Karna was incredibly powerful. He could shoot arrows like flaming tongues of fire! His attacks were like a huge, unstoppable firestorm. Yudhishthira feared Karna would easily defeat his army.

But Yudhishthira had hope.  He knew Arjuna, with Krishna's help, could stop Karna.  Arjuna was like a giant cloud, ready to bring rain (arrows) to put out Karna’s fiery attacks. Arjuna’s bow, Gandiva, was so powerful!

Yudhishthira was waiting for Arjuna to come back with the weapons.  He didn't want to stay in the Kamyaka forest without his brave brother. He asked Dhaumya, his wise advisor, to find another safe place for them to wait, a place with lots of food and nice views.  He said, "We'll wait here, just like a bird waits for the rainclouds, waiting for Arjuna to return."
