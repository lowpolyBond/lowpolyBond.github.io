Once upon a time, a wise man named Jaratkaru lived a very simple life.  A kind snake king named Vasuki had a sister.  He gave his sister to Jaratkaru to be his wife.  Vasuki promised to take care of her.

Jaratkaru and his new wife went to live in a beautiful room in the snake king's palace.  Before they settled in, Jaratkaru told his wife, "If you ever do something I don't like, I will leave you."  His wife sadly agreed.

She loved him very much. She was always careful and quiet, like a scared deer. She did everything she could to please him.  Soon, she became pregnant. The baby grew strong and bright, like a little fire!

One day, Jaratkaru fell asleep.  The sun was setting. His wife worried.  He was very strict about his prayers. If he missed them, he would be sad.  She gently woke him.

Jaratkaru was very angry! He thought she had insulted him. He shouted, "You did wrong! I'm leaving!"  His wife was very scared.  She cried, "I only woke you so you wouldn't miss your prayers!"

Jaratkaru said, "It's settled then.  I must go," but his wife begged him to stay. She explained that her family needed a baby, and this child was very important to them.

Jaratkaru softened a little.  He smiled and said, "The baby you are carrying is a very special, wise child. He will be a great leader!" Then, even though he was still a little upset, he left.  He went back to his quiet life, but he knew his wife and child were safe.
