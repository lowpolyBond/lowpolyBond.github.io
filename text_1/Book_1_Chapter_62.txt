King Janamejaya asked a wise Brahmin, "You told me a little about the Mahabharata, the story of the Kuru family.  But I want to hear the whole amazing story!  I'm so curious!  Why did good people do bad things, and yet everyone still praises them? Why did the strong Pandavas, like Bhima (who was as strong as ten thousand elephants!), let the wicked Kauravas hurt them? Why didn't Draupadi, the brave and beautiful princess, use her magic to punish them?  Why did the Pandavas follow Yudhishthira, even though he was a bad gambler? Why did Arjuna, with Krishna as his charioteer, suffer so much? Tell me everything!"

The Brahmin, Vaisampayana, said, "King, this is a very long story! It was written by the great sage Vyasa, and it's a hundred thousand verses long.  It's as holy as the Vedas!  It teaches about good and bad, fun and hard work, and how to live a good life. Listening to this story will wash away your sins! Even very bad people become good after hearing it.  It's called Jaya, which means 'victory,' and kings who hear it become powerful and win all their battles.  It helps good kings and queens have brave children.  Vyasa wrote this story to show the greatness of the Pandavas and other heroes.  It also tells about gods, goddesses, and saints.  It teaches about everything important in life.  Hearing this story brings good luck and long life.  It's better than getting treasures, or even winning the whole world.  Are you ready to hear it?"
