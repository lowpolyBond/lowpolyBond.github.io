Once upon a time, Queen Kunti lived with her family.  A very grumpy, powerful holy man named Durvasas visited.  Kunti was very polite and kind, even though Durvasas was mean.  He was so happy with her that he gave her a magical gift! He said, "You can call upon any god, and they will listen."

Kunti was a little girl then.  One day, she saw the sun shining brightly.  She remembered the holy man's words and, just for fun, she called on the sun god, Surya!  Whoosh!  Surya appeared! He was HUGE and bright! Kunti was so scared, she asked him to leave.  But Surya said, "I can't leave without giving you something." He worried he might hurt her, or the holy man who gave her the magical gift.

Kunti, to protect them both, asked for a son, just like Surya.  Surya gave her a son, and then disappeared.  Kunti was afraid, so she put her baby in a basket and sent him down the river. His name was Karna.  Later, she became a queen.  She always felt sad for leaving Karna.

Years later, Kunti told her wise friend Vyasa what happened.  Vyasa explained that Surya is very powerful. He can have children in a magical way, and Kunti hadn't done anything wrong.  Vyasa told Kunti not to worry; everything was alright.  He even promised to help her find her son, Karna.  Kunti was very happy to hear this.
