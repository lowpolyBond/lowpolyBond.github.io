Duryodhana asked his grandfather Bhishma, "Everyone says Vasudeva is the most important God.  Tell me about him!"

Bhishma said, "Vasudeva *is* the most important God! He's the God of all gods!  He has beautiful eyes, like lotus flowers.  He's amazing! He made everything: the water, the air, and the fire. He even made the Earth!

He was so powerful, he rested on the water and slept.  From his mouth, he made fire! From his breath, he made the wind.  He made words and the holy books! He made the whole world, all the gods, and even good and bad things like birth and death.  He is fairness and kindness. He gives everyone what they want. Heâ€™s everything! He made the past, the present, and the future.  

He made his first son, Sankarshana.  He also made Sesha, a giant snake that holds up the Earth! He is so powerful, only special people can understand him through meditation.  Once, a bad guy named Madhu tried to destroy everything, but Vasudeva stopped him!  Because of that, everyone calls him Janardana, "the one who killed Madhu."  He's like a strong boar, a brave lion, and even a three-headed god! He's the mother and father of everyone! There's no one more important than him!

He made people into different groups: Brahmanas from his mouth, Kshatriyas from his arms, Vaisyas from his thighs, and Sudras from his feet. If you're good and pray to him, you'll be safe and happy! People call him Kesava, Hrishikesa, and many other names. He's like a teacher, father, and best friend.  If you're lucky enough to have Krishna on your side, you'll be safe and happy! Even reading about him brings good luck! Yudhishthira, the good king, knows this and asked Krishna for help!"
