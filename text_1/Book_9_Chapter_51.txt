Once upon a time, there was a big battle.  A very strong man named Dadhica was very, very holy. He was so holy that even the king of the gods, Indra, was scared of him!  Indra tried to trick Dadhica with a beautiful fairy, but Dadhica was too strong.  Dadhica’s special power fell into the River Saraswati.  The river kept it safe and Dadhica's power grew into a baby boy!

The river gave the baby to Dadhica.  Dadhica was so happy! He named his son Sarasvata.  Dadhica gave the river a special gift –  everyone would be happy if they used the river's water.  He also said that one day, Sarasvata would teach many people.

Later, there was a big war between the gods and the bad guys.  Indra needed a very strong weapon.  He asked Dadhica for his bones!  Dadhica gave his bones to help the gods win.

After the war, there was a terrible drought. It lasted twelve long years!  Many wise men, called rishis, lost all their food. They even forgot important things they knew.

One day, the rishis found young Sarasvata. He was still reading and remembering the very important things they had forgotten.  The rishis asked Sarasvata to teach them.  Sarasvata was young, but he was very wise. He said, "It's not about how old you are, but how well you understand!"

The rishis became Sarasvata’s students.  They learned everything again and were very happy.  Even though Sarasvata was just a boy, 60,000 rishis learned from him! After learning, they all went away,  happy and ready to share what they had learned.
