King Dhritarashtra was sad.  He asked Vidura, his wise advisor, "How can we understand this confusing world?"

Vidura said, "Let me tell you about life, from the very beginning.  A tiny baby starts as a little bit of blood and special stuff inside its mother.  It grows slowly.  After five months, it looks like a baby, but it's still inside. It’s in a dark, messy place.  Then, the baby turns around, so its head is down. This is a little bit scary!  Finally, the baby is born.  It’s born because of things it did in past lives.

Then, the baby faces lots of problems.  Trouble seems to follow it, like hungry dogs chasing after meat. Sickness comes too. People get caught up in wanting things—like toys, candy, and even friends. They get greedy.  They don't always get what they want. But people who think carefully about life do better.  People who only think about what they want don't realize that death is coming. When it’s time, death takes everyone. Then they are reborn again.

People are tricked by wanting things.  Greed, anger, and fear make them forget who they really are. Rich people might think they are better than poor people.  Beautiful people might look down on those who aren’t.  But everyone dies.  In the end, everyone is the same.  In death, bodies are all bones and skin. No one is richer or prettier than anyone else.  Why should we lie to each other?

The best thing to do is to be good and kind. If you read wise words and try to live by them, you will be happy. That is how you can go on the best path and live a good life."
