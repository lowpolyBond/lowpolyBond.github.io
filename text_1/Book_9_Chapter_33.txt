Once upon a time, during a big war, a brave warrior named Bhima's brother, Yudhishthira, made a mistake.  He told Duryodhana, their mean enemy, "If you can defeat just one of us in a mace fight, you can be king!"

Krishna, a wise and powerful friend, was worried. He told Yudhishthira, "That was a silly thing to say! Duryodhana has practiced with a mace for thirteen years! He's super good!  Only Bhima, the strongest of us, has a chance, but even he might lose."

Bhima, hearing this, stepped up bravely. "Don't worry," he roared. "I’ll fight Duryodhana! My mace is even heavier than his!  I’ll win, and Yudhishthira will be king!"

Krishna was happy.  He said, "Bhima, you’re our best hope!  You've already defeated so many warriors – kings and princes!  But be careful, Duryodhana is strong and skillful!"  Everyone cheered Bhima on.

Then Bhima turned to Duryodhana. "Remember everything you did wrong!" Bhima shouted. "Remember how you treated Draupadi unfairly and cheated at games!  You've killed many good people, but today, I will defeat you!"

Duryodhana, a fearless warrior, didn't back down.  He said, "Enough talk! Let's fight! I've never lost a fair fight.  If you win by cheating, everyone will know you’re a coward!"

The air was thick with excitement!  The elephants trumpeted, the horses neighed, and everyone cheered for their favorite warrior.  The great mace fight between Bhima and Duryodhana was about to begin!
