Once upon a time, there was a bird catcher. He caught a pigeon and its mate.  He accidentally dropped the pigeon into a fire!

The bird catcher felt very, very sorry. He cried, "Oh, I'm so mean! What have I done?  I hurt a poor bird!"

He felt terrible. He thought, "I'm a bad person. I should be kind. That pigeon showed me how important kindness is, even if it meant losing its own life.”

The bird catcher made a big decision. He said, "I will change! I'll never hurt another bird again." He let the pigeon's mate go free.

He threw away all his tools – his nets and cages.  He stopped being a bird catcher.  He decided to be a good person, just like the brave pigeon.  He went on a journey, being very kind and gentle to everyone. He lived a simple life, showing everyone how important it is to be good.
