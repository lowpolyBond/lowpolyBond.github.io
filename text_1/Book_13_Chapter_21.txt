Once upon a time, there was a wise man named Ashtavakra. He was very smart, but he also had a tricky problem. A magical lady tested him!  Yudhishthira, a king, asked his friend Bhishma, “Why wasn’t Ashtavakra afraid of the lady’s magic?  And how did he get home safe?”

Bhishma explained, “Ashtavakra asked the lady, ‘How do you change your shape like that?  Tell me the truth!’”

The lady smiled.  “Everywhere, even in heaven, people want to be together.  This whole test was to see how strong you are, Ashtavakra.  You’re very strong, you haven’t given up your goals. I’m the North Star!  You saw how women are, even older women still want love.  Even the gods are happy with you.  I know why you’re here.  The Rishi Vadanya, your bride’s father, sent you to me.  I’ve already taught you everything you need to know! Go home safely. You’ll marry the girl you love, she’ll have a son.  Your desire for love is a natural thing.  What else can I tell you?”

Bhishma continued, “Ashtavakra bowed and asked to leave.  The lady said yes.  He went home, rested, and then asked his family if he could go see Rishi Vadanya.”

When Ashtavakra arrived, Vadanya asked him about his trip.  Ashtavakra said, “You told me to go to the Gandhamadana mountains.  North of those mountains, I met a wonderful goddess. She was very kind, mentioned you, and taught me many things.  Now I’m back!”

Vadanya was pleased. “Marry my daughter!” he said.

Ashtavakra married the girl. He was very happy, and he lived happily ever after with his wife, free from worries!
