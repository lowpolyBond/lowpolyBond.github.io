Once upon a time, King Yayati was talking to a wise man named Ashtaka.  Ashtaka asked, "King, who gets closer to God faster – someone who prays a lot, or someone who is really, really smart?"

King Yayati said, "The smart person gets there faster!  Smart people understand that the world isn't real in the same way God is. They see God right away. People who pray a lot also get closer to God, but it takes longer because they have to learn to stop thinking about everyday things."

He explained, "If a praying person doesn't get there in one life, they start again in their next life, closer to God than before. But the smart person always sees God, even if they have fun things in their life. Nothing stops them."  He added, "If you can't be smart, then be good and kind. But being good just to get to heaven doesn't work. It has to come from your heart."

Then Ashtaka said, "King Yayati, you look so young and handsome! Where are you going? Are you going to the Underworld?"

Yayati sadly replied, "Yes. I lost my good deeds and I'm going to the Underworld.  But I was lucky enough to get a special gift—I get to be in the Underworld with wise people like you."

Ashtaka, wanting to help, said, "King, you know everything! Are there good places for me in heaven?"

Yayati smiled, "Yes! There are so many heavenly places for you, more than there are animals on Earth!"

Ashtaka said, "I give all my heavenly places to you! Please don't go to the Underworld!"

Yayati said, "Thank you, but only a very holy person can accept that kind of gift, and I'm not one. I always tried to be good in my life, so I can't take your good deeds."

Another king, Pratardana, asked Yayati the same question. Yayati told him, "King, there are even MORE places for you in heaven! So many, you couldn't visit them all, even if you stayed in each place for a week!"

Pratardana also offered his heavenly places to Yayati, but Yayati refused again, saying, "A good king never takes the good deeds of another king. I have to go to the Underworld, but I will always do what is right."

After that, another king, Vasumat, began to talk to Yayati... and the story continues!
