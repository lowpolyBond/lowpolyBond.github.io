Once upon a time, a powerful wizard named Vishvamitra was very angry.  He cursed the Saraswati River!  The river turned red, like blood!  

Lots of scary Rakshasas (monsters) came to live there. They drank the bloody water and were very happy. They laughed and danced, as if they were in heaven.

Later, some wise holy men called Rishis came to visit the river. They were sad to see the bloody water and the Rakshasas.  They asked the river, "Why are you like this?"

The Saraswati River, all shaky and sad, told them about the wizard's curse. The Rishis said, "Don't worry! We will help!"

They prayed to a powerful god, Mahadeva, and did many good things, like praying and fasting.  Slowly, the river became clean again.  

But now the Rakshasas were very hungry! They were sad and asked the Rishis for help. They said, "We've done bad things. We are sorry!"

The Rishis told them, "Eat only food that's completely cleanâ€”no food with bugs, hair, or anything yucky." They also taught everyone to be careful about what they ate.

The river Saraswati then changed a little and became a new river called Aruna.  The Rakshasas bathed in the Aruna River, and they were no longer monsters. They went to heaven!

Even King Indra, the king of the gods, needed to visit this special place!  He had broken a promise with a monster named Namuchi and had done something bad.  The great god Brahma told Indra to bathe in the Aruna River and pray to be forgiven. Indra did that, and he was forgiven.

Another powerful man, Baladeva, also visited and became a better person. There was a great battle near the river a long time ago. Prince Skanda fought and won, which is why that place is so special.  A big tree still grows there today, where people remember the stories of the past!
