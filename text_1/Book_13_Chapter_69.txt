Once upon a time, in the land of Bharat, a kind prince named Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, about giving gifts.  He wanted to know the best gifts to make.

Bhishma said, "There are three amazing gifts: cows, land, and knowledge! Giving any of these brings good luck and makes your wishes come true!"

He talked a lot about cows. "Cows are very special," Bhishma said. "They're like mothers to everyone.  They bring happiness. Giving a cow is like giving a big hug to good luck! Never hurt a cow. They are sacred.  They are like goddesses."

Bhishma told a story about how gods used to plow fields with cows, but they should never be hit unless it was absolutely necessary for plowing.  He said, "If cows are thirsty and can't get water because someone is blocking them, they can even cause that person and their whole family to get in trouble just by looking at them!"  He explained how even a small act of kindness, like giving a cow a little grass every day for a year, can bring you good things like children, wealth, and fame.

Yudhishthira then asked, "But which cows should I give, and to whom?"

Bhishma replied, "Give cows to good people â€“ people who are honest, kind, and worship the gods. Don't give them to mean or dishonest people."

He said, "Giving ten cows to a poor but good Brahmin (a wise teacher) is incredibly lucky!  And remember, helping someone with your gifts makes you share in their good luck."  He said there were three kinds of fathers: the one who gives life, the one who saves a life, and the one who helps someone live.  Being kind and helpful to your teacher gets rid of bad things you might have done.   Pride is bad, and having children and cows helps people feel happy and secure.

Bhishma explained that the best people to give gifts to are wise teachers who are kind, peaceful, and helpful to everyone.  He said giving to a deserving person is as good as getting a huge reward, while taking something from a good person is a terrible thing to do.  You should always be kind and never hurt good people.
