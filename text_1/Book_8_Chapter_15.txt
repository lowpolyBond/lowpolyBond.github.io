Once upon a time, during a great battle, there was a mighty fight between Bhima, a strong Pandava warrior, and Ashvatthama, the brave son of Drona.

Ashvatthama, a super-fast archer, shot many arrows at Bhima.  Bhima was hit many times, but he looked as bright and strong as the sun!  Bhima roared like a lion and shot a thousand arrows back at Ashvatthama.

Ashvatthama, smiling, hit Bhima on the forehead with a big arrow. Bhima didn't flinch; he was as steady as a rhinoceros with its horn.  Then, Bhima smiled and shot three big arrows right back, hitting Ashvatthama on the forehead.  Ashvatthama looked like a beautiful three-peaked mountain after the rain.

They kept shooting arrows at each other, hundreds and hundreds! It was like a huge rain storm of arrows. They were so fast, they looked like two suns, shining brightly, fighting to destroy each other.  They fought like two tigers, their bows like mouths, and arrows like sharp teeth!

For a while, they disappeared under all the arrows, like the sun and moon hidden by clouds.  Then, they reappeared, shining like bright stars!

Ashvatthama shot many more arrows at Bhima, but Bhima didn't give up. He fought back fiercely!  Their chariots spun around as they fought.  They were both amazing warriors, trying their best to win.

Suddenly, it was like the whole world was ending!  Arrows crashed together, making sparks and fire! The sky was filled with arrows, like shooting stars.  Even magical beings watched, amazed. They said, "This is the greatest battle ever! These two fighters are incredibly strong and skillful. They are like two gods of death fighting!"

The battle was so intense, it even made the gods and magical beings cheer!  They shouted, "Well done, Ashvatthama! Well done, Bhima!"

Both warriors were hurt badly.  Their eyes were red with anger, and they gritted their teeth.  They shot so many arrows that they even hit each other's horses and flags!  Finally, a huge arrow hit each of them, and they both fell back in their chariots.

Ashvatthama's driver took him away, and Bhima's driver helped Bhima leave the battlefield.  Both great warriors were exhausted but had shown incredible bravery.
