King Yudhishthira's wise advisor, Vidura, went back to Dhritarashtra, the blind king.  He told Dhritarashtra what Yudhishthira had said. Yudhishthira was happy to give Dhritarashtra everything – his kingdom, his wealth, even his life!

Arjuna, Yudhishthira's brother, felt the same way. He wanted to give Dhritarashtra everything he owned.

Bhima, another brother, was sad and angry because of the war. He agreed to make peace, but it was hard for him.  He was a strong warrior, and remembering the battles made him sigh. Yudhishthira and Arjuna asked Dhritarashtra to forgive Bhima.  They said that's just how brave warriors are sometimes.

Vidura and Arjuna both begged Dhritarashtra to be kind.  They said, "You are our king! Everything we have is yours to give away!"

Vidura suggested that Dhritarashtra give away lots of gifts – jewels, animals, and food – to the poor and to priests. He suggested building beautiful tents for everyone to enjoy and making sure there was plenty of water for the animals.

Dhritarashtra was very happy with Vidura's message. He decided to hold a big party and give away tons of gifts on the full moon in Kartika month!
