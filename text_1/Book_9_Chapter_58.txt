Arjuna and his brother Bhima were fighting Duryodhana, a mean king.  Arjuna asked Krishna, their friend, "Who's better, Bhima or Duryodhana?"

Krishna said, "They're both strong. Bhima is super strong, but Duryodhana is very skillful and has practiced a lot.  If Bhima fights fairly, he might lose.  But sometimes, to win, you need to be clever, like the gods did when they tricked the bad guys.  Bhima promised to break Duryodhana's legs. He should do it!"

Krishna explained, "Yudhishthira, our king, made a mistake. He let the whole war depend on just one fight.  Duryodhana is tough.  He keeps coming back. Heâ€™s like a dangerous fire!  Bhima must use his strength and some clever tricks to win.  Otherwise, we might lose everything!"

Arjuna nodded, and gave Bhima a secret signal.

Bhima and Duryodhana fought!  They swung their heavy clubs.  Sparks flew! They were so strong, it was like two angry elephants battling!

They hit each other hard. They were tired, but kept fighting!  They were covered in blood, looking like wounded animals.

Then, Bhima tricked Duryodhana.  He pretended to be weak. Duryodhana smiled, thinking he'd won.  But BAM! Bhima swung his club and smashed Duryodhana's legs!

Duryodhana fell with a huge THUD! The earth shook! The wind howled!  It looked like a huge storm!

Everyone was shocked.  Animals screamed.  The sky rained dust and blood!  It was a very scary sight.

Even the gods and magical beings watched in awe.  Then, they all went home, talking about the amazing battle.
