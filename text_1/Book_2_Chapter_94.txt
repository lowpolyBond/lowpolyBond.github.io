Rama and Sita lived on a beautiful mountain for a long time.  Rama showed Sita all the amazing sights.  They were both very beautiful, like a king and queen!

Rama said to Sita, "Look, my dear Sita! This mountain is so pretty.  I don't even miss home anymore! See those tall, colorful mountains! They're full of shiny rocks and precious gems!  Lots of birds live here, too.  Even though there are lions and tigers, they're peaceful because of the good people who live here.  There are so many trees with delicious fruits and flowers, it's like a magical place!"

He pointed to many different kinds of trees â€“ mango, jambu, and lots more!  He showed her pretty birds and even cool creatures called kinneras who wore colorful clothes.  He showed her waterfalls and sparkling streams.  It was all so wonderful.

"The air smells so sweet," Rama said. "I'm happy to live here with you and Lakshmana for many years.  This mountain, Cittrakuta, is full of flowers and fruits, and the birds sing beautiful songs. We can live here happily.  It fulfills my father's wish and makes Bharata happy too. It's a peaceful place, perfect for being good and kind."

Rama showed Sita caves that looked like houses and gardens.  At night, special plants glowed like fire!  "This mountain is even more beautiful than the king's palace," Rama said. "We will live here for twelve years, Sita, and be good people."  Sita was very happy.
