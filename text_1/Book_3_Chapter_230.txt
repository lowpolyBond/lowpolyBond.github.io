Once upon a time, there was a powerful god named Skanda.  He was very strong and brave!  His mother, Swaha, loved the Fire-god, Agni, but Agni didn't know she felt that way.  Swaha asked Skanda to help her.

Skanda said, "What can I do for you, Mother?"

Swaha said, "I want to be with Agni forever!"

Skanda smiled. "From now on," he said, "whenever people make offerings to the gods, they'll say your name, Swaha, with their prayers.  This way, you'll always be with Agni in the fire!"

Swaha was so happy! She lived happily ever after with Agni.

Skanda also had a powerful father, Mahadeva.  Mahadeva and Skanda were very close. Mahadeva told Skanda, "You are very strong because of our family's powers.  Some of my power also made two small creatures, Mujika and Minjika.  They are your followers."  Mahadeva also explained that Skanda had many other followers who were powerful too.  He told Skanda to take care of them.

Skanda also got some cool things:  beautiful bells and flags!  He got them from the gods.  He sat on a shiny golden mountain, surrounded by friends and followers, and it was a wonderful sight.  Animals and birds played, and everyone was happy.

Later, Skanda became the leader of the godsâ€™ army.  His father, Mahadeva, and his mother, Parvati, came to see him.  They came in a magnificent chariot pulled by lions! Many other gods came too, including Indra, the king of the gods. They were a huge, amazing army!

Then, a big battle happened!  Evil Danavas attacked the gods' army.  They were very strong, and many gods were scared.  They were losing the battle!

But Skanda was brave!  He saw the gods were losing and rushed to help. He was strong and powerful, riding in a golden chariot pulled by chestnut horses. He fought so bravely.  He used his magic spear, and it killed many evil Danavas!  He even killed a giant Danava named Mahisha, who was super strong!

The gods cheered! They won the battle because of Skanda's bravery.  Indra was very happy and praised Skanda.  He had done a great job leading the army!  All the gods agreed that Skanda was a great hero.

Skanda had many names, like the Son of Fire, the Brave One, the Handsome One, and many more.

The story of Skanda teaches us about bravery, kindness, and how even small things can help us. The story also mentions that remembering and telling the story will help us and will help us be blessed by Skanda.
