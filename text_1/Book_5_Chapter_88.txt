Once upon a time, Duryodhana, a very naughty prince, told his grandfather, the king, that they shouldn't give Krishna any gifts.  "Krishna is very close to the Pandavas," he said. "If we give him gifts, he'll think we're scared!  A strong king doesn't show fear!"  He knew Krishna was very powerful and respected, but he didn't want to be nice to him. He wanted to win the war.

The king listened, but then his grandfather, a wise old man, spoke. "Krishna is always good, even if we don't give him presents.  Nobody should disrespect him.  He's too strong to be stopped!  Listen to what he says, and try to make peace with the Pandavas."

But Duryodhana had a terrible plan. "I won't share my wealth! I'll capture Krishna!  If we put him in jail, everyone will listen to me!" he whispered.

The king was very sad.  He told Duryodhana, "That's terrible! Krishna is our friend and relative. He hasn't done anything wrong!  We can't put him in jail!"

Bhishma, a very strong and wise warrior, was even angrier. "Your son is choosing evil! He's making terrible decisions! He is going down a dangerous path. If he tries to hurt Krishna, he and all his friends will be in big trouble!" Bhishma was so angry, he stood up and walked away.
