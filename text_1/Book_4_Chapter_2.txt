Once upon a time, the Pandava brothers needed to hide.  Bhima, the strongest one, had a plan.  "I'll be a cook!" he said. "I'll work for King Virata. I'll make the best food ever! I'll also carry huge piles of wood.  Everyone will be amazed by my strength!"

Yudhishthira, their wise leader, asked about Arjuna, the best archer.  "Arjuna is so amazing," he said. "He's like the sun â€“ the brightest! Like the best Brahmin, the strongest cobra, the fastest fire! He's unbeatable!"

Arjuna stepped forward.  "I'll disguise myself," he said.  "I'll be Brihannala, a woman! I'll wear bangles to hide the marks from my bow on my arms. I'll teach the King's ladies to sing and dance. I'll tell stories and keep my identity hidden, like fire hidden by ashes."

And so, Bhima became a strong cook, and Arjuna became a graceful woman.  They were ready to hide in King Virata's palace.  The story of their clever plan continues...
