King Salwa, a very strong king, marched towards Dwaraka with a HUGE army!  He had soldiers, horses, and elephants â€“ lots and lots of them!  Salwa's army spread everywhere, blocking all the roads into the city.

But the brave people of Dwaraka weren't scared!  Princess Samva, along with her brothers Charudeshna and Pradyumna, jumped into their chariots and zoomed out to fight.

Samva bravely attacked Kshemavriddhi, Salwa's top general.  Samva shot arrows like rain! Kshemavriddhi was strong, but Samva was even stronger!  He shot so many arrows that Kshemavriddhi had to run away!

Then, a giant named Vegavat attacked Samva.  Samva swung his big club and knocked Vegavat down!  He then charged into the enemy army and kept fighting.

Meanwhile, Charudeshna fought a powerful demon named Vivindhya. Their fight was super fierce, like two roaring lions!  Charudeshna used a magic weapon, and BOOM!  Vivindhya fell dead!

Seeing his army getting scared, King Salwa zoomed towards them in his awesome chariot. The Dwaraka soldiers started to feel afraid.

But Pradyumna, another brave warrior, shouted, "Don't be scared! I will fight Salwa! We will win!"  He promised to defeat Salwa and his army.  Hearing Pradyumna's brave words, the Dwaraka soldiers cheered and fought on!
