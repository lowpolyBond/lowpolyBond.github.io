Markandeya, a wise old man, said to the king, "Don't be sad! Remember Rama, the strong and brave prince. He went through hard times too when he was sent away to live in the forest. But he was strong and good, just like you. You are a brave warrior, and you have many powerful friends!"

"Even gods like Indra, the king of the gods, have had to fight hard battles. He fought terrible monsters with his friends, the Maruts, and won! With friends like Bhima, the strongest warrior, and the brave sons of Madravati, you have a powerful army.  They're amazing fighters!"

"Think about how your friends already rescued Draupadi, the princess who was taken away by a bad king. They fought bravely and brought her back! They also defeated Jayadratha, the mighty king! Even Rama, with only monkeys and bears to help him, defeated a ten-headed monster!"

"You have such powerful friends!  Don't be sad! Brave people like you don't give up!"

Then, the king listened to Markandeya. He felt better, stopped being sad, and started talking to Markandeya again.
