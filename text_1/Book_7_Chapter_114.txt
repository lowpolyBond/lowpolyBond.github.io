Once upon a time, during a great battle, Satyaki, a brave warrior, heard a lot of shouting.  He had just won a fight against Kritavarman.  Kritavarman was angry and shot many arrows at Satyaki.

But Satyaki was even angrier! He quickly shot back. He hit Kritavarman's horses, broke his bow, and even hurt his driver!  Kritavarman's army was scared and ran away.

Satyaki then saw a huge group of enemy elephants. They were led by a strong warrior named Rukmaratha. These elephants were huge and ready to fight. They were from a land called Trigartas and were very brave.  Satyaki told his driver, "Let's go fight them!"

His fast horses carried him to the elephants. The Trigartas shot lots of arrows, but Satyaki fought back like a storm!  He shot so many arrows that the elephants ran away, their tusks broken, and blood everywhere.  Some elephants were even hurt so badly that they were separated from their riders!

Then, a super strong warrior named Jalasandha came to fight. He was sitting on a big elephant, all decked out in gold. Jalasandha was very strong and he hurt Satyaki, breaking his bow.  But Satyaki wasn't scared!

He got a new bow and shot Jalasandha with sixty arrows! He even cut off Jalasandha’s bow with a sharp arrow.  Jalasandha threw a spear, but it only grazed Satyaki's arm.  Satyaki kept fighting and broke Jalasandha’s other weapons. Then, with some really sharp arrows, he cut off Jalasandha's arms and head! Jalasandha's elephant ran away, scared and hurt.

Satyaki's victory made the other soldiers scared, and they all ran away.  But then, the powerful warrior Drona and many other Kuru soldiers came to fight Satyaki.  A huge battle began – as big as the fight between the gods and the giants a long time ago!
