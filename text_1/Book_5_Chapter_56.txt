Duryodhana asked, "Sanjaya, the Pandavas have a huge army! What are they doing?"

Sanjaya said, "Yudhishthira, Bhima, and Arjuna are all happy and ready for battle.  The twins, Nakula and Sahadeva, aren't afraid either. Arjuna, wanting to test his magic spells, hitched up his amazing chariot.  He looked like a storm cloud full of lightning! He said, 'We will win!'"

Duryodhana grumbled, "You always praise those Pandavas!  Tell me about Arjuna's chariot – the horses and the flag!"

Sanjaya replied, "Arjuna's chariot is super special!  Magical beings built it. They put a magical flag on it.  It's so big, it covers a whole area!  Nothing can stop it. It's like a colorful cloud of smoke and fire in the sky!  Arjuna's chariot is pulled by one hundred super-fast, white horses, a gift from the Gandharva king.  They can't be stopped, even if they get hurt – they're always replaced. Yudhishthira's chariot has big, strong, white horses. Bhima's horses are as fast as the wind. Sahadeva's horses are even better than Arjuna's! They were a gift from Arjuna! Nakula's chariot has amazing horses, a gift from Indra, the king of the gods.  And the other princes have great horses too, all gifts from the gods!"
