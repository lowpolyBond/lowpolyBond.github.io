Once upon a time, during a HUGE battle, Duhsasana was fighting Dhrishtadyumna.  Duhsasana shot lots of arrows at Dhrishtadyumna's chariot.  Dhrishtadyumna was angry! He shot so many arrows back that Duhsasana couldn't even see his chariot anymore! He had to run away.

Then Dhrishtadyumna zoomed towards Drona, a powerful warrior. But Kritavarman and his three brothers tried to stop him.  Nakula and Sahadeva, twin brothers, jumped in to help Dhrishtadyumna.  It was a super exciting fight! Everyone fought bravely and fairly.  They used only regular arrows, no poison or trick arrows. They wanted to win honorably.

Four warriors from Duryodhana's army fought Nakula and Sahadeva. It was a fierce battle, but still fair. Dhrishtadyumna, seeing his friends were doing well, went after Drona.

Then, Duryodhana saw the fight and rushed in.  His friend Satyaki came to fight him too.  Duryodhana and Satyaki had been friends as children.  They looked at each other and smiled, remembering their fun times together. Duryodhana felt sad they were fighting.  He said, "This war is silly! We were best friends!"  Satyaki replied, "This is a battle, not playtime!"

They fought anyway.  They shot many arrows at each other. Duryodhana broke Satyaki's bow, but Satyaki got a new one.  They kept shooting until Duryodhana was hurt and had to go to a new chariot to rest.

When Duryodhana was in trouble, Karna rushed to help. But Bhima, another powerful warrior, stopped him.  Bhima and Karna fought. Bhima broke Karna's chariot wheel, but Karna kept fighting!

Yudhishthira, the Pandava king, saw his friends were fighting hard.  He told his soldiers, "Fight bravely! If you win, you will be heroes! If you die, you'll go to a wonderful place!"

Everyone fought even harder.  The Pandavasâ€™ twins told Arjuna to help.  Arjuna rushed in, and it became a giant, confusing battle.  On that day, many warriors fought bravely and the battle continued.
