King Janamejaya asked a wise man, "Is there just one big Purusha (person), or are there many?  Who is the most important Purusha? And where did everything come from?"

The wise man answered, "Some people believe in many Purushas, like in the Sankhya and Yoga teachings. But others believe there's only one really big Purusha.  It's like many little streams all coming from one big river. This whole universe is like that one big Purusha! Let me tell you a story."

He bowed to his teacher, Vyasa, a very wise man. "This story is in the Vedas (holy books), and Vyasa thought about it a lot.  Other wise people thought about it too, starting with Kapila.  Vyasa told me this story about Brahma and Shiva."

Long ago, there was a sparkly golden mountain called Vaijayanta in the Milky Ocean. Brahma, a powerful god, loved to sit there and think. One day, his son Shiva, a three-eyed god, came to visit.

Shiva bowed to his father, and Brahma lifted him up.  Brahma asked Shiva, "My son, how are you? How are your studies and prayers going?"

Shiva said, "I'm fine, Father. But I'm curious. Why are you always alone on this mountain? You have a beautiful home with lots of gods, goddesses, and magical creatures! Why are you here alone?"

Brahma smiled. "I'm thinking about the ONE big Purusha, the one that's bigger than everything!"

Shiva was puzzled.  "Father, you made many Purushas. You keep making more!  But you're talking about ONE giant Purusha. Who is this amazing being you're thinking about?"

Brahma explained, "My son, there are many Purushas, but the one I think about is bigger than all of them!  You can't even see him. All the other Purushas come from him. If the other Purushas become very pure, they can become one with him.  He's the biggest, the best, the one who's always been and always will be!"
