Once upon a time, Prince Rama went to see his father, King Dasaratha.  The king looked very sad and sick.  Rama bowed down to his father and then to his stepmother, Kaikeyi.

The king was so upset he could only say Rama's name.  Rama felt scared, like someone who just saw a snake. He didn't know what was wrong.  His father usually smiled when he saw him.  Today, he only looked sad and worried.

Rama asked Kaikeyi, "Mother, did I do something wrong?  My father is usually happy to see me.  What's making him so unhappy?"

Kaikeyi was tricky.  She said, "The king isn't angry, but he has a secret. He loves you very much but can't tell you.  You must do what he promised me a long time ago."

Rama said, "I will do anything my father asks! I would even jump into a fire or drink poison for him!"

Then Kaikeyi revealed a terrible secret.  Long ago, she saved the King's life in a battle.  He promised her two wishes.  Her wishes were that Rama's younger brother, Bharata, would become king, and that Rama would go live in the forest for fourteen years!

Rama was shocked, but he didn't show it.  He agreed to go. He loved his father and wanted him to be happy.  The king, however, was heartbroken to send his beloved son away.  He knew this was going to be very hard on Rama.
