Once upon a time, Bhima, a strong Pandava prince, went with his brothers to a lake full of beautiful lotus flowers.  His wife, Draupadi, wanted some of these special flowers.

Bhima told some scary Rakshasas (demons) guarding the lake that he only wanted flowers for his wife.  But the Rakshasas said, "No! This lake belongs to Kuvera, the god of wealth.  Only special people can take flowers from here!"

Bhima said, "I'm a Kshatriya, a warrior! We don't ask for permission! This lake isn't Kuvera's private pond; it's for everyone!"

The Rakshasas got angry. They shouted, "We'll catch you! We'll tie you up! We'll cook and eat you!"

But Bhima was super strong! He swung his big, golden mace and fought the Rakshasas.  He was so strong, he easily beat them all!  More than a hundred Rakshasas ran away!

Bhima jumped into the lake and picked lots of fragrant lotus flowers for Draupadi.  The lake water was magical; it made him even stronger!

The scared Rakshasas ran to Kuvera and told him about Bhima. Kuvera smiled and said, "Let him have the flowers. I already knew he would come."

The Rakshasas went back to the lake. They saw Bhima happily picking flowers, and they knew he was stronger than them.  Everyone was happy in the end!
