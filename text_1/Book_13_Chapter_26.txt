Once upon a time, after a big battle, the mighty warrior Bhishma was hurt and lying on a bed of arrows.  He was very brave and wise, like the best gods! King Yudhisthira and his brothers visited him.  Many, many wise saints came too – so many that it’s hard to name them all!  They were all there to see Bhishma.

The brothers showed the saints great respect. The saints talked amongst themselves about Bhishma, and he felt very happy, like he was already in heaven.  Then, poof! The saints disappeared! The brothers bowed again and waited on Bhishma, like good servants. They were amazed by the power of the saints. Then they talked to Bhishma.

Yudhisthira asked Bhishma, "Grandfather, what are the holiest places in the world – the best countries, provinces, mountains, and rivers?"

Bhishma told him a story.  A very holy man met a wise saint. The holy man asked the same question.

The saint said, "The holiest places are near the Ganga river!  The Ganga is the best river in the whole world.  Living near the Ganga, bathing in it, is like doing lots and lots of good deeds.  It cleanses you of your sins! Even people who did bad things can become good again by going to the Ganga. The Ganga is so special, it’s like the sun to the sky, or the air we breathe.  It makes everyone happy!  Even if you only see or touch the Ganga, it can help you. It washes away all your sins!"

The saint told the holy man many more wonderful things about the Ganga.  He explained how the Ganga was so pure and powerful, it was like the best food for the gods! It could take away even the worst sins. It could even bring your ancestors and future generations to a better place.

Bhishma finished his story, and said to Yudhisthira, "You too, should always remember the Ganga.  Be good and it will help you!" Yudhisthira and his brothers were very happy to hear about the amazing Ganga river.  Bhishma said that anyone who hears this story about the Ganga will also become better.
