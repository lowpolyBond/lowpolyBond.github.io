Once upon a time, Queen Kaikeyi was very angry.  She whispered to her friend Manthara, "I want Rama to leave, and Bharata to be king!"

Manthara, who didn't like Rama, said, "I have a plan!  Do you remember what happened long ago, when your husband, King Dasaratha, fought a big battle? He promised you two wishes!"

Queen Kaikeyi said, "Yes!  Tell me how to use them!"

Manthara explained, "King Dasaratha was hurt badly. You saved him, so he promised you anything!  Ask for two things: First, make Bharata the king. Second, send Rama away for fourteen years!"

Manthara told Kaikeyi to go to the King's special room. She said, "Act sad and upset. Don't talk, just cry. The King loves you very much. He'll give you what you want!"

Kaikeyi liked Mantharaâ€™s plan. She thought Manthara was very clever and beautiful, even though she had a hunchback. Kaikeyi promised Manthara lots of jewels if her plan worked.

Kaikeyi went to the King's special room. She threw her jewels on the floor and cried. She told the King, "Either Rama goes away for fourteen years and Bharata becomes king, or I will die!"

Manthara kept telling Kaikeyi bad things about Rama.  She said, "If Rama becomes king, you and Bharata will be unhappy."

Queen Kaikeyi agreed.  She was so upset she didn't wear any jewelry and didn't eat or sleep.  She decided she would only be happy if Rama left and Bharata ruled the kingdom.  She was determined to get her way.
