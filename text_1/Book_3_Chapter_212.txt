Long ago, in the land of Bharat, a wise man asked a clever bird-catcher a big question.  He wanted to know: "How does our body work? How does our breath make us move?"

The bird-catcher explained, "It's all thanks to our spirit, the part of us that thinks and feels.  This spirit is inside both our body and our breath.  It's with us always – in the past, now, and the future. It's the best part of us!  It's like a tiny spark of the big, powerful spirit that made everything."

The bird-catcher went on, "Our body has special airs inside.  One air, called Prana, helps us breathe. Another, Samana, moves things around inside.  Apana helps us get rid of waste. Udana helps us move and Vyana keeps everything connected.  These airs, along with our body's warmth, help us digest our food and grow."

He said, "These airs work together like a team.  They're all connected to our belly button, and tiny tubes carry the good parts of our food all around.  The spirit lives in our bodies, and though it's always there, it's like a fire – it changes depending on what's around it."

The bird-catcher also explained that everyone has three things inside them: goodness, passion, and darkness.  These are all part of life, which is part of the spirit, and the spirit is part of the big, powerful spirit that runs everything.  Even though our body seems like just stuff, the spirit makes it alive and moving!

He said that by being kind, brave, and true, and by getting rid of greed and anger, we can see the big, powerful spirit within ourselves. It's like a bright light shining in our hearts.  We find this light by being peaceful and quiet, and by thinking good thoughts.

The bird-catcher said that giving up bad habits, helping others, and being kind to everyone is the way to a happy life and to find peace.  He said, "The best thing we can do is learn about our own spirit, and be at peace with everything."  Then, the wise man understood.
