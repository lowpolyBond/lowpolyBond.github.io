Once upon a time, a wise man named Jajali lived in a forest. He was very, very serious about being good. He went to the beach and did super hard exercises to be holy. He ate very little, wore old clothes, and didn't talk to anyone for a long time.  He was so good, he thought he was the best in the whole world!

Some magical creatures told him, "You're not the best!  There's a man named Tuladhara who is much better."

Jajali was angry. He wanted to meet Tuladhara.  The magical creatures helped him get to the city of Varanasi.

Now, Jajali had done amazing things before!  He'd stood outside in the rain for so long that birds built a nest in his messy hair!  He didn't move, even when the birds laid eggs and the baby birds grew up. He only left when the birds flew away for good.  He was so proud of himself, he bragged about it! But then a voice said, "You're still not as good as Tuladhara!"

Finally, Jajali found Tuladhara, a kind shopkeeper. Tuladhara already knew all about Jajali's amazing story.  Tuladhara said, “You took care of the birds, that was good. But you became proud of it.  True goodness isn't about bragging; it’s about being kind without thinking about how great you are.”

Jajali learned a big lesson that day:  Being truly good means being kind and humble, not just doing amazing things and boasting about them.
