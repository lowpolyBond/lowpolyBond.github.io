Once upon a time, during a great battle, Arjuna, a brave warrior, was fighting.  He saw a lot of dust and heard people crying.  A powerful warrior, Bhagadatta, was fighting on a huge elephant!

Arjuna told his friend Krishna, "That elephant is amazing!  It's super strong and can't be hurt easily. Only Krishna and I can stop him!  Let's go!"

As Arjuna went to fight Bhagadatta, suddenly, fourteen thousand other soldiers attacked!  Arjuna had a big problem.  Should he fight Bhagadatta or these new soldiers?

He thought hard.  Then, he decided to fight the fourteen thousand soldiers first. They shot many arrows at Arjuna and Krishna.  The arrows covered them completely!

Arjuna used a super-powerful arrow, a Brahma weapon, and defeated all those fourteen thousand soldiers!  Lots of soldiers, elephants, and chariots fell to the ground. It was a really amazing victory!

Krishna was so impressed! He said, "Arjuna, that was incredible!  Even the gods couldn't have done that!"

Arjuna then said, "Now, let's go fight Bhagadatta!" And they went to face him.
