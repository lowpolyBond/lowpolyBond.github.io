Once upon a time, Princess Krishna was very upset.  A mean man, a soldier for King Virata, had been rude to her.  She felt so sad!

Krishna went to her room.  She washed her face and body, but she still felt terrible.  She thought and thought. "What can I do?" she wondered.  "Who can help me?"

Then, she remembered her strong husband, Bhima!  "Only Bhima can fix this," she said to herself.

That night, Krishna tiptoed to Bhima's room.  She was so worried! She found him sleeping soundly.  She rushed to him, like a little calf running to its mother.  She hugged him tightly, just like a vine wraps around a big tree.

"Wake up, wake up!" she whispered, her voice soft like a sweet song. "That mean soldier who hurt me is still alive!  You have to stop him!"

Bhima woke up. He saw how upset Krishna was.  He sat up and said, "My dear Krishna, what's wrong?  You look pale.  Tell me everything, good or bad. I will help you. You can always trust me."  He knew she needed him.  He would always protect her.
