Once upon a time, a prince named Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandpa, what's the very best, purest place to visit?"

Bhishma smiled. "All holy places are good, my prince," he said, "but the best is the place called Manasa.  Imagine a lake so deep you can't see the bottom, sparkling clean and pure. Its water is Truth itself, and the lake is understanding.  Bathing there means becoming free from greed, being honest and kind, never hurting anyone, and always calm."

Bhishma explained that truly pure people are like holy places themselves!  He said, "People who aren't attached to things, who aren't boastful, who are happy no matter what happens, who don't have families or possessions—they are holy. The purest person is someone who knows everything and doesn't think, 'This is mine!'"

He continued, "True purity isn't just clean skin. It's about being a good person inside. It's about letting go of the past, not wanting things too much, and always being cheerful."  Learning new things makes you pure, too!  It's better to be pure inside than just clean on the outside by washing in a river.

Bhishma said there are special places on Earth, too, that are holy.  Visiting them, praying, and remembering your ancestors washes away your mistakes.  But the best purity comes from being a good person *and* visiting those holy places.  It's like having both strength and skill – together, they make you unstoppable!  If you're pure in your heart and visit the special places on Earth, you'll be the purest and happiest person of all!
