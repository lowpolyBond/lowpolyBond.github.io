Yudhishthira asked his grandfather Bhishma, "Grandpa, you told me about gold.  Now, tell me about Taraka, the bad guy the gods couldn't defeat!"

Bhishma said, "Long ago, a powerful demon named Taraka made the gods very sad.  The gods asked six special ladies, the Krittikas, to raise a baby who could defeat him.  This baby was Agni, the fire god's, special son.

The Krittikas each took a piece of Agni's power and carried the baby in their bellies. When the babies were born, they magically joined into one strong baby boy! The Earth took the baby from a pile of gold.

The baby was amazing! He was strong and bright, like the sun.  Everyone called him Kartikeya because the Krittikas raised him. They also called him Skanda and Guha.

All the gods and even animals came to see him. They gave him toys!  Garuda, a big bird, gave him a peacock.  Others gave him a boar, a buffalo, and lots of other fun things.

Taraka saw Kartikeya growing up and tried to hurt him, but he couldn't! Kartikeya became a great warrior and fought Taraka.  He defeated the bad demon easily!  He saved the gods and became their amazing leader.

Because Kartikeya was born from the same power as gold, gold is very special and lucky. Giving gold away is a good thing. Just like Rama, a long time ago, did."
