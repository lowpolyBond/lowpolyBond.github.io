The Pandava brothers went on a big trip to holy places.  They started at the Kausiki River.  They visited many special places.  Finally, they reached the ocean where the Ganga River flows into it.  They all took a holy bath in the ocean, surrounded by hundreds of rivers.

Then, they traveled to the land of the Kalinga people.  A wise man named Lomasa told them about a special place there, by the Vaitarani River.  Even the great god Rudra had been there!  He’d tried to take a special animal for himself, but the other gods told him that wasn’t right.  They gave Rudra a special offering, and he gave back the animal.  Lomasa said that if anyone bathed in the river and told this story, they could see the path to heaven!

The Pandavas and Draupadi, the daughter of King Drupada, bathed in the Vaitarani River. They poured water for their fathers. Yudhishthira, the eldest Pandava, was amazed! He felt like he was already touching heaven!  He could hear people praying from very far away!

Lomasa explained that the sounds were from a magical forest, three hundred thousand *yojanas* away! (A *yojana* is a really, really long distance!)  That forest was where a great god, Viswakarma, had performed a huge ceremony.  During that ceremony, the Earth itself was given away as a gift!  But the Earth was sad about being given away, so a good saint named Kasyapa did something special to make her happy. The Earth popped back up from the water, like a special altar!

Lomasa said Yudhishthira could get even stronger by stepping on this altar that went all the way to the sea.  But he had to say some special words first: words about fire, the sun, water, and other important things.  Then, he had to carefully step onto the altar and cross the sea!  

After the wise man said the magic words to protect Yudhishthira, he bravely stepped on the altar, crossed the sea, and went to sleep near the Mahendra mountain. What an adventure!
