Once upon a time, after a big battle, the brave King Yudhishthira went to see his wise grandfather, Bhishma.  Bhishma was lying on a bed of arrows, but he was still very smart.

Yudhishthira asked Bhishma, "Grandfather, how can someone be beautiful, rich, and kind? How can they be good, wealthy, and happy?"

Bhishma smiled. He said, "There's a special thing you can do! It's called the Chandravrata vow. You do it at a very special time."

He explained that it's done when the moon is in a certain position in the sky.  Imagine the moon like a person, and all the stars are parts of his body.  He said the moon's toes are touching one star, his knees another, and his head is on a different star.  He named all the stars – Mula, Rohini, Aswini, Ashadha, and many more! It's a very special time, like a magical puzzle in the sky.

Bhishma said, "When the moon is in all these special star positions, you start the Chandravrata vow."

After finishing the vow, you give gifts of yummy melted butter (ghee) to the wise priests who know the holy books.  Then, Bhishma said, you'll be wise, kind, beautiful, rich, and happy – just like the full, bright moon in the sky!
