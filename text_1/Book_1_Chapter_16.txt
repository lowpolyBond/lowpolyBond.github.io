Once upon a time, long, long ago, there were two sisters named Kadru and Vinata. They were very beautiful and married a kind man named Kasyapa.  Kasyapa loved them very much and gave each a special wish.

Kadru wished for a thousand amazing snake children. Vinata wished for two sons stronger and better than Kadru's snakes.  Kasyapa made both wishes come true!  He told them to be careful with their eggs.

Kadru's eggs hatched after five hundred years, and out popped a thousand snakes! But Vinata's eggs didn't hatch.  Impatient, Vinata broke one egg.  A baby bird inside was angry!  He cursed her to be a servant because she was impatient. He said if she waited, her other egg would hatch a powerful son who would save her.  The angry baby bird flew to the sky and became the sun's driver!

Five hundred more years passed.  Then, Vinata's other egg hatched, and out flew Garuda, a giant, strong bird who ate snakes! He flew away to find food. And so Vinataâ€™s curse began, but she still had hope.  Garuda, the mighty bird, would eventually save her!
