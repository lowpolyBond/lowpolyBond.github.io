Once upon a time, there was a big battle about to start.  The Kauravas, led by Duryodhana, were ready to fight the Pandavas.  Sanjaya told the King Dhritarashtra about the amazing army of the Kauravas.

Duryodhana's army was HUGE!  It had Bhishma, the strongest warrior, leading the way.  Drona, another great warrior, was also there with his soldiers.  Duryodhana's brothers and many other brave soldiers were ready to fight.  Duryodhana told everyone, "We are so strong! We have so many warriors.  We will surely win!"

Bhishma's army was so big it stretched far and wide.  Drona had his own army too. There were soldiers from many different kingdoms, all ready to fight. The Kaurava army was like a giant wave of soldiers, ready to crash down on their enemies.

On the other side, the Pandavas were also ready.  Arjuna, Bhima, and Yudhishthira were there with their brothers and their army.  They too, had brave soldiers from different lands.

Then, the amazing sound of war began!  The Kauravas blew their horns, making a loud, roaring sound.  The Pandavas did the same.  Arjuna blew his horn called Devadatta, Bhima blew his horn called Paundra, and Yudhishthira blew his horn called Anantavijaya. All the horns and drums made a very loud noise!

The earth trembled from the sound of all the horns and the shouts of the soldiers.  Both armies were ready to fight, their hearts pounding with excitement and fear.  The battle was about to begin!
