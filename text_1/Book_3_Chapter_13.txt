Once upon a time, King Yudhishthira, a very good and kind king, lost everything in a game of dice.  His uncle, Vasudeva, was very sad about this.  Vasudeva said, "If I had been there in Dwarka, this wouldn't have happened!  Even if nobody invited me, I would have stopped the game! I would have told Dhritarashtra (Yudhishthira's uncle) and his sons, the Kauravas, how bad dice games are. I would have asked Bhishma, Drona, Kripa, and Vahlika for help. I would have told Dhritarashtra, 'Don't let your sons play dice!'  Dice games are very dangerous; they cause so many problems! People lose everything â€“ their homes, their money, even their friends!  They cause arguments and unhappiness.  Dice games, along with drinking, hunting, and women, are four things that bring bad luck.  I would have told Dhritarashtra all this! If he listened, everyone would have been happy. If he didn't listen, I would have made him stop!  And if his bad friends tried to help him gamble, I would have stopped them too! It's all because I wasn't there! I only heard about your trouble when I arrived in Dwarka from Yuyudhana.  My heart is so sad to see you and your brothers in this terrible trouble!"
