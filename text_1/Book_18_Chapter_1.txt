Once upon a time, after a great war, the Pandavas, the good brothers, went to Heaven.  Yudhishthira, the best brother, saw Duryodhana, their wicked cousin. Duryodhana looked happy and powerful, surrounded by gods!

Yudhishthira was angry! He didn't want to be in the same place as Duryodhana, who had been so mean.  He remembered all the bad things Duryodhana had done:  how he had made them suffer, how he had hurt Draupadi, their wife. Yudhishthira shouted, "I don't want to be near him!"

A wise god named Narada smiled.  "In Heaven," he said, "everyone forgets their anger.  Duryodhana fought bravely, even though he did bad things.  He went to the hero's part of Heaven because of his bravery."

Yudhishthira still felt sad. He missed his brothers and friends who had died in the war.  He asked Narada, "Where are my brave brothers? Where are Karna, Abhimanyu, and all the others who fought so bravely?"

Narada explained that everyone who had been brave and fought well, even those on Duryodhana's side, were in Heaven, but in different places.  Yudhishthira learned that even though Duryodhana had been bad, his bravery in battle earned him a place in Heaven.  Yudhishthira then finally felt peace, knowing his brothers and friends were also in Heaven, even if not right beside him.
