Once upon a time, a powerful holy man named Chyavana lived in King Kusika's palace.  He acted strangely! He slept for 21 days without moving. Then he left without saying a word.  He disappeared and reappeared! He even burned all the delicious food! Then, he rode in a chariot through the city and gave away lots of treasures!  Finally, he showed the king and queen a magical forest filled with beautiful golden palaces and sparkling jewels – but then it all vanished!

King Kusika was very puzzled. "Holy man," he asked, "Why did you do all these things?"

Chyavana smiled. "I'll tell you," he said. "A long time ago, I heard a prophecy.  It said that because of a fight between priests and warriors, my family line would mix with another. Your grandson will be very powerful." Chyavana explained, "I came to your palace to destroy your family line, but I saw you were very kind and good."

"I slept for 21 days hoping someone would wake me," Chyavana continued. "I left quietly hoping you’d ask me why. I disappeared and reappeared, hoping you'd be angry. I burned the food hoping you'd be upset. I gave away treasures hoping to make you mad. But you never got angry! You were patient and kind.”

Chyavana said, "The magical forest was a glimpse of heaven! I showed you this to reward your goodness."  He then told the king, "Your grandson will be a holy man! He'll be a priest, and he'll be very strong and brave! Your family will be blessed!"

King Kusika was overjoyed. "That's wonderful!" he exclaimed. "This is the best gift!  Please tell me more about how this will happen!" Chyavana promised to explain everything, and then he left to travel to sacred places.
