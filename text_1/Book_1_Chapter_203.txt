King Dhritarashtra was secretly plotting against the Pandavas, his nephews.  He pretended to like them in front of Vidura, his wise advisor, so Vidura wouldn't guess his plan.  Once Vidura left, Dhritarashtra asked his son, Duryodhana, and his friend Karna for ideas.

Duryodhana had many sneaky plans.  "Father," he said, "we can use clever spies! They can make the Pandava brothers fight each other. Or, they can give King Drupada lots of gifts, so he'll stop helping the Pandavas.  Maybe we can even trick the Pandavas into moving far away, to Drupada's land. We could even make them unhappy with their friend Krishna!"

Duryodhana had another, even worse idea. "Or, Father," he whispered, "we could have our spies kill Bhima! He's the strongest Pandava. Without Bhima, the others would be too weak to fight us. Or, if they come to us, we can trick them and kill them then! We need to act fast, before they become good friends with King Drupada."

Duryodhana also suggested other tricks, like sending beautiful women to distract the Pandavas, or making them unhappy with Princess Draupadi.  He finished, "These are my ideas, Father.  What do you think, Karna?"
