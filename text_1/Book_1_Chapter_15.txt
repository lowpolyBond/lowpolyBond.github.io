Long ago, a snake mommy was very angry.  She put a curse on all the snakes!  She said, "The god of fire, who rides in a chariot of wind, will burn you all up!"

A brave snake king wanted to stop this bad curse.  He married his sister to a very good, wise man.  This wise man and the snake princess had a wonderful son named Astika.  Astika was super smart and kind. He loved everyone equally.  He helped his mom and dad feel safe.

Many years later, a king decided to have a big fire sacrifice!  This sacrifice was meant to kill all the snakes!  But Astika, who was now a grown-up, was very brave. He stopped the sacrifice! He saved all his snake family â€“ his brothers, uncles, and aunts! He even helped his parents go to a good place after they died.

Astika was so good and kind. He did lots of good things.  He prayed to the gods, helped other people, and did everything right.  He was a really great guy. That's the story of Astika!  What story should I tell you next?
