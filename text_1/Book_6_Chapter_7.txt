King Dhritarashtra asked his wise friend Sanjaya, "Sanjaya, tell me about the wonderful lands north and east of Mount Meru and the Malyavat mountains!"

Sanjaya said, "South of the Nila mountain and north of Mount Meru is a magical place called the Northern Kurus.  It's where special beings called Siddhas live. The trees there always have sweet fruits and beautiful flowers. Some trees give you whatever fruit you want! Others give milk and yummy food, even clothes and jewelry! The land is full of shiny golden sand, and some parts sparkle like rubies, diamonds, and other pretty jewels.  The weather is always nice, and the lakes are filled with clear, sparkling water.

The people there are very handsome and kind. They’re actually special people who came from the sky! They always have twins—a boy and a girl—who are equally beautiful and kind. They grow up together, loving each other like best friends. They never get sick and are always happy. They live for a super long time, ten thousand and one hundred years, and never leave each other. When they die, strong birds called Bharundas gently carry them to caves in the mountains."

"Now, let me tell you about the east side of Mount Meru," Sanjaya continued. "The best part is called Bhadraswa. There’s a giant forest and a HUGE tree called Kalamra. It's so tall—a whole Yojana tall!—and the Siddhas and Charanas love it. The people there have white skin and are very strong. The women are beautiful, like lilies and the moon! They’re great singers and dancers, too. They live for ten thousand years and stay young forever by drinking the juice of the Kalamra tree."

"South of Nila and north of Nishadha is a super old Jambu tree.  It's magical and grants wishes! Because of this tree, the area is called Jamvudwipa.  The tree is incredibly tall—a thousand and one hundred Yojanas!  Its fruits are huge, and when they fall, they make a loud noise and spill a silvery juice. This juice becomes a river, flowing to the Northern Kurus.  Drinking the juice makes you happy and you never get thirsty again! This area also has special gold, shiny like tiny insects, used for beautiful jewelry. The people there have skin as golden as the morning sun."

"Finally," Sanjaya said, "on top of Mount Malyavat, there's a big fire called Samvataka.  It burns at the end of the world!  Mount Malyavat is eleven thousand Yojanas tall!  The people who live there have golden skin and are very holy. They’re so strong and holy that they travel to the sun, helping everyone. Sixty-six thousand of them go around the sun each year, making it shine even brighter."
