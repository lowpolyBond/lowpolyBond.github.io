Long ago, a wise man named Jamadagni lived with his family. He loved to pray and study holy books. He married Renuka, a beautiful woman. They lived in a cozy hermitage and had four sons.  Then came their fifth son, Rama, who was very brave and good.

One day, Renuka saw a king looking handsome in the river.  She liked what she saw, and felt a little bit bad about it. Jamadagni, her husband, knew she wasn't feeling right. He was very angry.  He told his sons to do something very sad:  to kill their mother.  Rumanvan, Sushena, Vasu, and Viswavasu were shocked and couldn't do it.  Jamadagni was so mad, he made them become like animals!

Then Rama came home.  His father told him what happened, and sadly asked him to kill Renuka. Rama, though he was very sad, obeyed. He did what his father asked, even though it was very hard. Jamadagni was sorry for being so angry. He gave Rama anything he wished for. Rama asked for his mother to come back to life, for his brothers to be normal again, and to be very strong and brave.  Jamadagni made it all come true!

Later, a mean man named Arjuna, who was the son of a powerful king, came to their home. He stole their special cow and broke their trees.  Rama got very angry.  He fought Arjuna and defeated him.

But Arjuna's family was very angry.  While Rama was away, they attacked Jamadagni.  They couldn't hurt him while he was praying so they shot him with arrows until he died.  Rama came home and found his father dead. He was heartbroken.
