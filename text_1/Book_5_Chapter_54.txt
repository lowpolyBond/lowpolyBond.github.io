King Dhritarashtra was sad.  He was worried about the upcoming war.  His advisor, Sanjaya, spoke to him.

"King," Sanjaya said, "you know the Pandavas are very strong.  Arjuna is the best archer ever!  His bow, Gandiva, is magical.  With it, he can defeat anyone."

Dhritarashtra sighed.  "But I followed my sons' advice," he said.  "I was wrong to laugh when they cheated the Pandavas at the dice game.  I should have stopped them."

Sanjaya explained, "You hurt the Pandavas a long time ago. You weren't a good father to them.  You should have protected them.  You were happy when your sons won the kingdom unfairly.  You didn't see how powerful the Pandavas really were."

He continued, "The Pandavas actually gave you your kingdom!  They won it with their strength, and then they gave it to you.  Arjuna even rescued your sons when they were in danger.  Yet you laughed at the Pandavas' misfortunes."

Sanjaya described Arjuna's amazing power.  "Arjuna's arrows are like a storm! His chariot, pulled by white horses, is unstoppable.  He has Krishna fighting beside him.  Bhima is his strong warrior brother.  They're unbeatable!"

"The Kauravas are afraid," Sanjaya said.  "Even other kings are joining the Pandavas because they know how strong Arjuna and Bhima are. They see your sons' injustice. Your sons' actions will lead to their destruction."

Sanjaya finished, "King, stop crying. Vidura and I warned you before. It's too late to change things now.  Your worry won't help."
