Once upon a time, the wind god talked to King Arjuna.  He said, "Arjuna, you're mistaken! Brahmins are super special! They're the best!"

The wind god told stories to prove his point.  He said,  "Long ago, the Earth got into a fight. A powerful Brahmin, Kasyapa, made the Earth freeze! Brahmins are strong, even stronger than the Earth!"

He told another story about a Brahmin named Angiras. "Angiras was so powerful, he drank all the water in the world!  He was still thirsty, so he made more water appear!  Even I, the wind god, was scared of him! I hid from his anger!"

The wind god continued, "Even Indra, the king of the gods, was punished by a Brahmin! A Brahmin named Gautama cursed him! And the ocean, once full of clear water, became salty because Brahmins were angry!"

He even said, "The fire god, Agni, lost his bright glow because a Brahmin, Angiras, was mad at him! And sixty thousand sons of a king were turned to dust by a Brahmin named Kapila!"

The wind god said, "Arjuna, you're powerful and learned. You have a big kingdom.  But even the mightiest kings bow to Brahmins, even those still in their mothers' wombs!  A Brahmin destroyed the whole Dandaka kingdom! Another Brahmin, Aurva, defeated the strong warrior Talajangala! You worship Agni every day. Do you know Agni is a Brahmin?"

The wind god explained, "Brahmins are the protectors of everyone.  Some people say Brahman, the creator of the world, came from an egg.  But that's wrong!  Brahman is unborn! He is the one who created everything â€“ the earth, the sky, and all the living things. Brahman is the true king!"

After hearing all this, King Arjuna was quiet. He had a lot to think about.
