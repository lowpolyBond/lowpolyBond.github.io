Once upon a time, there was a very strong king named Kalmashapada. He loved to hunt.  One day, he hunted deer and wild boars in the forest. He was very tired after a long time of hunting.

A wise man named Saktri, the son of a great Rishi (a holy man) named Vasishtha, was walking on the same path.  The king told Saktri to move. Saktri said, "Kings should always make way for holy men!"  The king was angry. He was so angry, he hit Saktri with his whip!

Saktri was very upset. He cursed the king, "Because you were mean, you will become a monster who eats people!"  Another wise man, Viswamitra, was nearby.  He wanted Kalmashapada to be his student.  But he saw that Saktri had already cursed the king, so he secretly helped the curse come true. A scary monster went into the king's body.

The king became sick and strange. A hungry holy man asked the king for food. The king said he would get him some later.  When he went back to his palace, he told his cook to get food for the holy man. The cook couldn't find any meat.

The monster inside the king said, "Give the holy man human flesh!" The cook, sadly, did what the king said.  The holy man saw the meat was from a person. He was angry and cursed the king again, "Because you gave me unholy food, you will always want to eat people!"

The king's monster side got even stronger. He even ate Saktri!  Then, he ate all of Saktri's brothers.  Vasishtha, their father, was heartbroken. He tried to kill himself. He jumped off a mountain, but he didn't die.  He jumped into a fire, but he didn't die. He jumped into the ocean, but he didn't die.  Vasishtha was so sad but he couldn't die!  Finally, he went back home, still very sad.  The story shows how anger and being mean can have very bad consequences.
