King Dhritarashtra asked Sanjaya, "Sanjaya, tell me about the great battle between Karna and Ghatotkacha!  What did Ghatotkacha look like?  What was his chariot like, and his horses? What weapons did he have?"

Sanjaya said, "Ghatotkacha was HUGE!  He was as tall as a mountain!  He had blood-red eyes and copper-colored skin. His belly was sunken, and his hair stood straight up. His ears were long like arrows, and his mouth stretched from ear to ear! He had a scary green head and big, sharp teeth. His chariot had a hundred bells and bright red flags. His horses were huge and strong, like angry elephants.  His chariot was even bigger than a house! It was covered in bear skins, and had eight wheels.  A scary Rakshasa drove the chariot."

"Ghatotkacha carried a giant bow and lots of powerful weapons.  He looked very frightening!  He rushed towards Karna, ready to fight."

"Karna and Ghatotkacha fought a long and fierce battle.  They shot arrows at each other.  Their arrows flew everywhere! It was like two elephants fighting, or two tigers!  They were both so strong, neither could win at first."

"Karna couldn't beat Ghatotkacha. So, Karna used a magic weapon! But Ghatotkacha used his magic too!  Suddenly, lots of other scary Rakshasas appeared, throwing rocks and spears!  Everyone was scared, except Karna.  He broke Ghatotkacha's magic, and the extra Rakshasas disappeared."


"Ghatotkacha got angry. He threw a giant wheel at Karna, but Karna cut it into pieces with his arrows! Then Ghatotkacha threw trees from the sky! Karna shot arrows and destroyed Ghatotkacha's horses and chariot. He hit Ghatotkacha with so many arrows that he was covered in them, like a porcupine!"

"But Ghatotkacha was very clever.  He kept using magic! He changed into a mountain, then a cloud, even a tiny little creature! Then he grew huge again, with a hundred heads! He even became invisible!"


"Ghatotkacha kept fighting, changing shapes and using magic. He threw more magic weapons, but Karna kept breaking them! Karna was very brave and clever.  He fought Ghatotkacha with more magic weapons. Finally, Karna used a powerful weapon and defeated Ghatotkacha."

"Ghatotkacha was a powerful warrior, but Karna was even stronger and cleverer that night.  The battle was amazing, full of magic and courage!"
