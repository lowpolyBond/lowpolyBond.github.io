Once upon a time, a wise king named Yudhishthira wondered about marriage. He asked his grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandpa, why do people say marriage is about doing everything together? Is it just what old wise men said, or is it about having babies, or is it just for… fun?"

Bhishma smiled. "Yudhishthira, let me tell you a story.  A very holy man, Ashtavakra, wanted to get married. He asked a wise Rishi for his beautiful daughter, Suprabha."

Ashtavakra was given a special task. "Go north," said the Rishi, "and you will see amazing things. Then, you can marry my daughter."

Ashtavakra agreed. He traveled far, crossing big mountains. He saw magical creatures dancing, and he even visited the home of Kubera, the king of the treasures!  Kubera was very kind and showed Ashtavakra wonderful things, like beautiful dancing women and amazing music.  Ashtavakra stayed for a whole year, enjoying the sights and sounds!

Finally, Ashtavakra continued his journey. He found a beautiful forest, and inside, a magical palace.  Seven very pretty women greeted him.  But Ashtavakra was strong and wise. He didn't let their beauty distract him. He asked them to leave except for the oldest lady.

That night, the old lady tried to tempt Ashtavakra. "I am very lonely. Let's spend time together," she said.  She told him all women like romance and not many are truly faithful to their husbands.

But Ashtavakra refused. "I only want a wife to have children with," he said. "I am not interested in other things. Marriage is about having a family and doing what's right."

The old lady was surprised. She then revealed a secret:  She was actually a magical being, and she had been cursed to look old and ugly.  Ashtavakra's goodness had broken the curse. He then understood.  Marriage isn’t just about fun or having a baby,  it’s about kindness, respect, and being good to each other. Then he finally married Suprabha.  He learned that a true marriage is built on love, respect, and doing what's right.
