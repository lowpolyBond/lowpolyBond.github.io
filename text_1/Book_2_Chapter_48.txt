Rama, the prince, had to leave his home.  Everyone in the city was very, very sad.  They cried and cried.  They didn't want to live without him.

People stopped smiling.  No one played.  No one cooked nice meals. Even mothers didn't hug their babies as much.  Husbands came home, but their wives were still upset.  They missed Rama so much!

"What good are our homes and riches without Rama?" they asked.  "Only Lakshmana, who went with Rama and Sita, is lucky!"

They talked about how beautiful the forest would be with Rama there.  The trees would bloom for him, the rivers would be happy to see him.  Rama made everything better.

"Let's follow Rama!" the women said to their husbands. "Let's serve Sita and Rama in the forest.  We don't want to live under Kaikeyi, the queen who made Rama leave. She's mean!"

The women were heartbroken.  They cried like their best friends were dying.  Night came, but there were no lights in the houses.  No one sang or danced.  The city of Ayodhya felt empty and sad, like the sky without stars.  Everyone missed Rama more than anything.  It was like a silent, empty ocean.
