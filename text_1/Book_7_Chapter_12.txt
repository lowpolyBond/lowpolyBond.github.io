Sanjaya told the king, "I saw everything! I’ll tell you how Drona, the great warrior, died.  Drona was in charge of the Kaurava army. Duryodhana, the Kaurava king, asked Drona for a favor.

Duryodhana said, "Teacher, you’re my best warrior!  Give me a boon!  Bring me Yudhishthira, the Pandava king, alive!"

Drona was surprised. He said, "Why do you want Yudhishthira alive, Duryodhana?  Why not ask for him to be killed?  Everyone knows Yudhishthira is a good, honest king. He has no enemies who want him dead."

Duryodhana explained, “If we capture Yudhishthira, the Pandavas will lose. They will all follow him back to the forest. Then we will win!”

Drona thought this over. He knew Duryodhana was clever but not honest.  Drona said, "Okay, I’ll get you Yudhishthira, but only if Arjuna, Yudhishthira’s brother, isn’t there to protect him. Arjuna is the greatest warrior!  Even the gods couldn’t beat him! But if Arjuna isn't around, I'll capture Yudhishthira."

Duryodhana and his brothers were happy. They thought Yudhishthira was as good as captured! They told everyone in their army that Yudhishthira was about to be theirs.  They didn't understand that Drona was only tricking them.  Drona, though, knew what he had to do to capture Yudhishthira.
