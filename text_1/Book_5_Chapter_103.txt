Narada, a wise man, showed a beautiful city to Matali, the charioteer of the gods.  "This is Bhogavati," he said, "ruled by King Vasuki, a snake king!  Shesha, a giant snake, lives here. He's so strong he holds up the whole Earth! He's huge and white, like a mountain, with a thousand heads and fiery tongues!"

Many other snakes lived there, all strong and powerful. Some had many heads, some had few.  They were all shiny and beautiful, with amazing jewelry. Narada named lots of them: Vasuki, Takshaka, Karkotaka...and many, many more!  There were so many, it was hard to count them all!

Matali looked around.  He saw a handsome young snake, standing near another snake named Aryaka. "Who is that amazing young snake?" Matali asked Narada.  "He's so handsome and smart, I think he'd be a great husband for my daughter, Gunakesi!"

Narada smiled. "That's Sumukha," he said.  "He's a prince! He's from a very important snake family.  His grandpa was Aryaka, and his father was Chikura, but sadly, a bird killed Chikura."

Matali was very happy. "Sumukha is perfect!" he exclaimed. "Please help me ask for his hand in marriage!"  And so, the charioteer hoped to marry his daughter to this wonderful young snake prince.
