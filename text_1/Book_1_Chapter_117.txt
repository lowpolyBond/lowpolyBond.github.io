King Dhritarashtra had many sons!  King Janamejaya wanted to know their names.  Vaisampayana, a wise storyteller, began:

"First came Duryodhana, then Yuyutsu.  There was Duhsasana, and many others!  Their names are hard to remember, so many there were!  There was Duhsala, their only sister.  There was Karna, too, a very important one!

They had so many sons, itâ€™s hard to list them all!  They were all strong warriors, brave and skilled with swords and bows and arrows. They were very clever and knew a lot. Dhritarashtra picked good wives for all his sons. He also chose a good husband for his daughter Duhsala.  Her husband's name was Jayadratha."

(Note: This simplified version omits a large number of names to avoid overwhelming a young child.  The focus remains on the key figures and the overall message.)
