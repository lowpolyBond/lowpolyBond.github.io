Arjuna, the brave warrior, went to a magical city in the sky!  It was Indra's city, so beautiful!  It had flowers of every color, and trees taller than any he'd ever seen.  There were amazing gardens called Nandana, where beautiful Apsaras (fairy-like creatures) loved to play.  The air smelled sweet, like a thousand flowers blooming all at once.

Only very good people could see this place.  People who were kind, helped others, and prayed a lot.  People who were naughty, drank too much, or were mean couldn't see this magical city.

Arjuna saw amazing flying chariots, thousands of them!  Some flew around, and others stood ready.  The Apsaras and Gandharvas (magical musicians) sang beautiful songs to welcome him.  Even the gods themselves, with the great Rishis (wise men), bowed to him.  He heard trumpets and drums playing joyful music.

Indra, the king of the gods and Arjuna's father, told Arjuna to go on a special path among the stars. There, he met many important gods and wise men –  the Adityas, the Vasus, and so many more!  He greeted them all politely.

Finally, Arjuna met Indra.  Indra held a beautiful white umbrella over himself, and was fanned by magical fans.  Lots of singers and musicians praised him. Arjuna bowed down to his father, and Indra hugged him tightly!  Indra even let Arjuna sit next to him on his special throne!  Arjuna shone brightly, like a god himself.

Indra smiled and patted Arjuna’s strong arms.  Then, many beautiful Apsaras started to dance!  They had long, flowing hair and graceful movements. Their dancing was so lovely, it could make anyone happy.  They twirled and leaped, making everyone smile.  It was a truly amazing sight!
