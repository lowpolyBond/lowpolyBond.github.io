Duryodhana, the son of Dhritarashtra, was very angry.  His father had worried about the Pandavas winning the war.  Duryodhana scoffed, "Father, don't worry!  The Pandavas can't win!  They think the gods are on their side, but that's not true.

Wise people like Vyasa and Narada have told us that gods are different. Gods don't get angry or jealous like us. They don't fight over things.  If Agni (the god of fire), Vayu (the god of wind), or Indra (the king of the gods) fought like humans, the Pandavas wouldn't be in trouble!

The gods always do what's right. Even if they felt jealous, it wouldn't work. I'm much more powerful than the gods! I can stop a huge fire, even if it was burning everything. I can put mountains back together if they crack! If a huge storm tries to destroy the world, I can stop it. I can even make the water so hard that armies can march across it!

I control everything, for both gods and demons! My army goes wherever I want.  My kingdom is safe; there are no scary snakes or monsters. The clouds give my people rain whenever they need it. Everyone is happy and safe. The gods won't help the Pandavas; if they could, the Pandavas wouldn't have been losing for so long.

Nobody can win against me!  I've never lost a battle. I always do what I say I'll do. Everyone knows I'm powerful and truthful. I'm not bragging, but it's true!  The Pandavas, along with their friends, will be defeated by me.  They'll be destroyed, like rivers disappearing into the ocean.

I'm smarter, stronger, and better than them in every way. I know everything about weapons, just like Drona and Kripa.

After saying all this, Duryodhana asked Sanjaya for more news about Yudhishthira and his plans for war."
