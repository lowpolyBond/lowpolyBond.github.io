Once upon a time, King Dasaratha was very sad.  His wife, Kaikeyi, saw him looking worried.  She reminded him of a promise: he had promised her two wishes.

Kaikeyi said, "King, why are you so sad?  You promised me two wishes.  Being truthful is very important.  Even long ago, kings showed how important truth is by doing what they promised.  So, fulfill your promise to me.  My wish is this: send Rama away. Send Rama far, far away.  I want this, I really, really want this, this is what I wish for. If you don't, I won't live."

King Dasaratha was so upset. He felt trapped, like a bird stuck in a cage.  He was very angry with Kaikeyi. He said, "Kaikeyi, you’re being unfair!  I don't want to send Rama away!" He was so sad that he even thought about ending his own life.

The next morning, everyone was excited.  Rama was going to be king! The streets were decorated, and everyone was happy.  The wise man Vasishtha came with everything needed for the ceremony: flowers, special water, even a white elephant!

Then, the king's driver, Sumantra, came to wake the king.  He said, "King, everyone is waiting for Rama's coronation.  Wake up and make everyone happy!"

But the King was still sad. He told Sumantra how upset he was about Kaikeyi’s wish. Then Kaikeyi tricked Sumantra, too!  She told him to bring Rama to the palace quickly. She said the king was just sleepy and wanted to see Rama.

Sumantra went to get Rama. He wondered why Kaikeyi was in such a hurry. He didn’t know that trouble was coming. He had no idea what a terrible day this would be for Rama and his family.
