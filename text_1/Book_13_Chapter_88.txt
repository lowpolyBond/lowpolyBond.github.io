Yudhishthira, a very good king, asked a wise old man, Bhishma, "What special food can we give to our ancestors' spirits so that it never runs out?"

Bhishma said, "Good question!  Different foods make the ancestors happy for different amounts of time.  Simple things like sesame seeds, rice, barley, and water make them happy for a month.  But sesame seeds are the best!

Fish makes them happy for two months. Mutton for three months, hare for four months, goat for five, bacon for six, and bird for seven months.  Venison from a Prishata deer makes them happy for eight months, from a Ruru deer for nine, and from a Gavaya animal for ten. Buffalo meat makes them happy for eleven months, and beef makes them happy for a whole year!  A creamy rice pudding called Payasa is just as good as beef.

Even better, Vadhrinasa meat keeps them happy for twelve *years*!  And rhinoceros meat, given on the day they died, never runs out!  Special plants like Kalasaka and Kanchana flower petals, along with goat meat, also never run out when given to the ancestors.

The ancestors themselves sang a song about what they like best.  They love Payasa on a special day, under a certain star.  They also like goat meat or Kanchana flower petals.  They especially like Payasa offered in a shady spot.

It's really good to have many children, so at least one can go to Gaya, a very special place with a big tree.  Anything offered under that tree never runs out! Even a small offering of water, roots, fruits, meat, and rice with honey, given on the anniversary of someone's death, will never run out either!"
