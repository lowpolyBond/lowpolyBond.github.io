A terrible battle had ended.  Gandhari, a queen, was very sad.  She told Krishna, a powerful friend, about Abhimanyu, a brave young warrior.  Abhimanyu, as strong as his father and Krishna combined, was like a fierce lion.  He fought alone against many enemies, but he was killed.  Even in death, he looked strong and beautiful.

His wife, Uttara, was heartbroken.  She gently touched his body, remembering how they used to laugh and dance.  She kissed his face, which was as beautiful as a lotus flower.  She held his golden armor, now stained with blood. She cried, "Krishna, my husband was as brave and handsome as you! He's gone."

Uttara spoke to Abhimanyu’s body as if he were alive.  She said, "My love, you slept on soft deer skins.  Why are you lying on the hard ground now?  Why won't you talk to me? You used to speak even from afar. You leave me, your family, and your father, Arjuna, so sad."

She held his bloody hair and cried, "Wicked warriors like Karna, Drona, and Kripa killed you!  They surrounded you, a young man, and killed you! How could they?"  She said that Arjuna, Abhimanyu's father, was very sad, and nothing could make the family happy again.  She promised to join Abhimanyu in heaven.  She wondered why she was still alive after seeing him dead.  She said, "Our time together was too short.  We only had six months."

Other people were also dead.  Uttara’s family tried to move her and Abhimanyu’s body, but they were too sad and weak.  King Virata was also dead, lying on the ground surrounded by birds and animals.  Other young warriors, like Uttara’s brother, also lay dead. Krishna looked at all the dead bodies and felt very sad.
