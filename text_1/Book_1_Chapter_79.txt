Once upon a time, Devayani was talking to her father, Sukra.  Sukra was a very wise teacher. He told Devayani, "My dear, the strongest person isn't the one who is angry all the time. The strongest person is the one who controls their anger.  It's like a horse and carriage â€“ a good driver keeps a tight hold on the reins, even when the horses are pulling hard.  Someone who calms down quickly wins everything."

Sukra explained that forgiving others is even better than doing a good deed every day for a hundred years!  He said little children sometimes fight because they don't know what's right and wrong, but grown-ups should be wiser.

Devayani listened carefully. She said, "Father, I know all about anger and forgiveness. But sometimes, we can't just forgive someone who is being mean.  For example, a teacher can't just forgive a student who is very disrespectful, if they want to help that student learn.  I don't want to live where people are unkind and don't respect good people."

Devayani was very sad.  She felt hurt by the mean words of another girl named Sharmishtha.  She said, "Those mean words burned my heart, like dry wood burning in a fire. It's worse than anything to see someone mean get lucky while you're unhappy.  I'd rather die than live like this!"  Devayani was very upset because she felt that kindness wasn't valued where she was.
