Queen Kaushalya was very sad.  Her son, Rama, had been sent away.  She saw the King, her husband, also very sad.  She said, "King, that mean Kaikeyi sent Rama away to the forest! She's like a scary snake, slithering around after doing something bad.  It would have been better if she made Rama a poor beggar in the city, or even her servant, than send him away like this!"

Rama, strong and brave like a king elephant, is now walking to the forest with Sita and Lakshmana.  He's never been in trouble before!  How will he live in the forest, eating only berries and roots?  Will I ever see my Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana again?

Imagine Ayodhya, our city, filled with happy people, flags, and flowers, welcoming Rama home!  Will that day ever come? Will Rama return like a bull leading his cows home at sunset? Will people throw flowers and rice on him, happy to see him again?  When will I see my sons, Rama and Bharata, handsome as mountains, return?

I picture them walking through the city with Sita, receiving gifts from everyone.  And Rama, running to me, happy as a little boy!  I love Rama so much!  It's like a mother's love for her baby.  Kaikeyi's actions have made me love Rama even more. Now that he's gone, I feel like a mother cow whose baby has been taken by a lion.  My brave, kind Rama knows everything! I can't live without him. The sadness is burning me up like the summer sun!
