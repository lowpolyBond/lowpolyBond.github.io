King Yudhishthira asked his grandfather Bhishma, "Grandfather, you're so wise!  You know everything!  We're in trouble, and you're the only one who can help us. Please tell us a wonderful story about good and bad, and what happens after we die.  Even Narayana, the great king, is here listening to you!"

Bhishma smiled. "Of course, my dear grandson! I'll tell you a story about Vishnu's amazing power.  I'll also tell you about a puzzle that even the great god Shiva and his wife Parvati couldn't solve!"

Bhishma began, "Once, Krishna, the kindest person, was doing a very long, very hard prayer for 12 years.  Many wise people came to visit him: Narada, Parvata, and many others.  Krishna welcomed them. They sat on beautiful seats and talked about good things. Then, a powerful fire came out of Krishna's mouth!  It burned a whole mountain! All the animals screamed and ran away. But then, Krishna looked kindly at the mountain, and it was whole again, with all the plants and animals back!"

Everyone was amazed! The wise people asked Krishna, "Why did that happen?"

Krishna said, "That fire was my own power, my energy. I was praying so hard that it came out!  I'm doing this prayer to get a powerful son. The fire went to see Brahma, the creator, who said my son will have half of Shiva's power!"

Krishna added, "I want to hear something amazing *you* have seen or heard. Tell me a wonderful story!"

The wise people were so surprised by Krishna's story! They all looked at him with wonder. Then, they chose Narada, the best storyteller, to tell Krishna a really amazing tale.

Narada said, "I will tell you about something incredible that happened on the Himavat mountains.  It was so amazing that everyone who saw it was filled with wonder."  And so, Narada began to tell his story...
