King Yudhishthira was very sad.  All his sons, grandsons, and friends had died in the big battle. He cried and trembled. His friends tried to comfort him.

Then, Nakula arrived in his shiny chariot.  Princess Krishna was with him. She was heartbroken because all her sons were killed. She was so upset, she shook like a tree in a strong wind.  She fell to the ground crying in front of Yudhishthira.

Bhima, the strong one, rushed to help her. He picked her up and held her.  Princess Krishna cried and said, "You won the war and the whole kingdom, but you don't seem to care that your sons are dead. You don't even remember Ashwatthama, Drona's son, who killed them while they were sleeping!  Unless you kill that wicked Ashwatthama, I will sit here and die!"

Yudhishthira, the kind king, said, "My dear Krishna, your sons died bravely. Don't be so sad. Ashwatthama is far away.  How can we find him?"

Draupadi, another queen, said, "Ashwatthama has a special jewel on his head.  If you bring me that jewel after you kill him, I will live."

Princess Krishna then spoke to Bhima, "Bhima, you're the strongest! You’ve always saved us from danger. Please kill Ashwatthama, and avenge the death of our sons!”

Bhima felt very sad for the queens.  He hopped into his golden chariot. Nakula drove. Bhima aimed his bow, ready to fight and find Ashwatthama.  His fast horses galloped towards where Ashwatthama had gone.
