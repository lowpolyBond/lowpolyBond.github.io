Once upon a time, Kunti, the mother of the Pandava brothers, spoke to everyone about peace.  Bhishma and Drona, two wise warriors, then talked to Duryodhana, the Kaurava prince.

"Duryodhana," they said, "you heard Kunti's words, right?  They're very important. Her sons, the Pandavas, are strong and with Krishna on their side, they won't give up until they get their share of the kingdom.  You've been mean to them and Draupadi.  They were very patient, but not anymore.

Arjuna, the Pandavas' best warrior, is amazing! He has a powerful bow and arrows, a super chariot, and a strong army.  With Bhima, Nakula, Sahadeva, and Krishna helping them, the Pandavas are unstoppable! Remember when Arjuna beat all of you in battle in Virata's city?  And when he saved you all from the Gandharvas?  He’s a great warrior!

Please, Duryodhana, make peace with your brothers, the Pandavas.  Yudhishthira, your older brother, is kind and wants you to be happy. Forget your anger.  Hug your brothers! Let Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva embrace you.  Then everyone can live together in peace and share the kingdom.

But things look bad.  There are scary signs.  The stars aren't happy.  Animals and birds are acting strange.  Bad things are happening in your city. Meteors are falling.  Even the animals seem sad.  Jackals are howling!  These are warnings of a terrible war!  Many soldiers will die.

Listen to us.  You can choose peace or war. If you choose war, you will regret it when you hear Bhima’s roar and Arjuna’s bow.  Choose peace, Duryodhana, please!  It's the only way to stop this terrible war.”
