Yudhishthira was curious.  He asked, "King, becoming a Brahmin is very hard.  But Viswamitra, a warrior, became one! How did he do it?"

The King began to tell a story.  Viswamitra was a powerful warrior.  Once, he was very angry. He fought Vasishtha, a wise Brahmin, and even destroyed a hundred of Vasishtha's sons!  He was so angry he made scary monsters appear!

But Viswamitra was also very strong.  He did very hard prayers and became a great leader of many wise people. He even helped others. He saved Sunasepha from being killed!  He helped Harishchandra become his son.  He punished his own sons for being mean to their brother.  He even brought Trisanku, a man who had become a low-caste person, to heaven!

Viswamitra was so powerful that even gods were afraid of him!  A beautiful fairy, Rambha, was turned to stone because she disturbed his prayers.  Even Vasishtha, a very powerful Brahmin, was scared of Viswamitra!  

Viswamitra prayed to the great god Indra, and Indra helped him.  He became so holy that he shone brightly in the sky among other wise men.

Yudhishthira said, "But how could he become a Brahmin without changing his body?"

The King explained, "Viswamitra's hard prayers and good deeds were so great, he earned the status of a Brahmin. It wasn't about his body, it was about his heart and actions." He was different from Matanga, another man who also prayed hard but couldnâ€™t become a Brahmin.  Viswamitra showed everyone that being a good person is more important than where you were born.
