Once upon a time, there was a handsome prince named Rama.  He was kind and brave.  He told his wise advisor, Sumantra, to tell his father, the King, that he was ready to leave.

Sumantra found the King very sad.  He was as sad as a hidden fire, or a dry lake.  Sumantra bowed and said, "Your son, Rama, is here! He gave away all his things to the poor. He said goodbye to his friends. He's ready to go to the forest."

The King, who was very good and wise, said, "Sumantra, please get the Queen and all the other ladies of the palace. I want to see Rama."

Sumantra brought all the queens.  They were all crying because Rama was leaving.  They were very sad.  Then the King asked Sumantra to bring Rama.

Rama came with his brother Lakshmana and his wife Sita.  When the King saw Rama, he was so happy, but then he got so sad that he fainted!

Rama and Lakshmana quickly helped their father.  The whole palace was filled with crying women. They cried, "Rama! Rama!"

After a while, the King woke up. Rama said, "Father, I'm going to the forest.  Lakshmana and Sita want to come with me."

The King was very upset.  A wicked queen, Kaikeyi, had tricked him.  He said, "Rama, take the kingdom! Don't go!"

But Rama said, "Father, I will go to the forest for fourteen years. Then I will come back." Rama was very good and honest. He promised to go to the forest and he would keep his promise.  

The King cried. He hugged Rama and fainted again!  Everyone was very sad except Kaikeyi. Even Sumantra fainted from sadness! The whole palace was filled with crying.  Rama was leaving, and everyone loved him very much.
