Once upon a time, after a big, sad battle where many brave warriors died, the Pandava brothers – Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva – felt very heartbroken.  Their cousin Krishna had also gone to heaven.

Yudhishthira, the oldest brother, said, "It's time for us to leave the world and go on a journey."  He gave the kingdom to Yuyutsu, and made Parikshit the new king.  He also made sure that Vajra, a surviving Yadava prince, became a king too.

The Pandavas then said goodbye to everyone.  They gave away lots of treasures and food to the wise people. They performed special ceremonies to remember their dead relatives.  Then, the Pandavas gave up their fancy clothes and wore simple bark clothing.  Their wives were very sad, but the brothers were determined.

Along with Draupadi, their wife, and a dog, the five brothers started their journey.  People from the city tried to stop them, but the Pandavas were already set on their journey.

As they walked, Arjuna was still carrying his amazing bow and arrows.  Suddenly, a god of fire appeared!  He told Arjuna to throw his bow and arrows into the ocean.  Arjuna did as he was told, and the god of fire disappeared.

The Pandavas continued walking, following the sun, going all around the world, trying to reach a special place. The dog kept following them faithfully.  They were going on a great adventure, to find peace and happiness, even though they felt very sad about what happened.
