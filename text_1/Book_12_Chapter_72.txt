Long ago, in a land far away, a wise old man named Bhishma told a king a very important story.  He said, "A good king needs a wise priest to help him.  This story will show you why!"

The story was about a king named Pururavas and a powerful wind god named Matariswan. Pururavas asked, "How did the different groups of people start? And why are priests so important?"

Matariswan explained, "Long ago, a great being called Brahman created everything.  The priests came from Brahman's mouth.  The warriors came from his arms. The farmers and traders came from his legs.  And the workers came from his feet.  Priests are special because they know the ancient sacred stories."

Matariswan continued, "Warriors protect the land. Farmers and traders keep everyone fed and provide goods. Workers help everyone else.  Priests guide everyone with wisdom."

Pururavas asked, "Who really owns the land? The priests or the warriors?"

Matariswan said, "Everything belongs to the priests because they were created first. But since priests don't always want to rule, warriors often take that role.  A good king should always listen to his wise priests. They guide him to be fair, good, and kind. A good king protects his people. He makes sure everyone is safe, so they can be happy and do their jobs.  When people are happy and safe, they do good things. This makes the king powerful and brings him good fortune. The king is like the sun, the rain, and everything good in the land! He keeps everyone safe and happy!"
