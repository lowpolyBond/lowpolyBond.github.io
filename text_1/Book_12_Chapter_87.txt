Yudhishthira, the king, asked Bhishma, the wise old man, "How can I keep my kingdom strong and safe?"

Bhishma said, "Listen carefully!  To keep a kingdom strong, you need a good system.  Think of it like this:

First, each village has a leader.  Ten villages have a supervisor over those leaders.  Two supervisors report to one officer.  That officer is in charge of many villages.  Then there are even bigger officers in charge of hundreds, and even thousands of villages!

Each village leader keeps track of everything happening in their village and tells their supervisor.  The supervisors tell their officer, and so on, all the way up to the king.  The village leader collects taxes and things from the villagers.  Each level of leadership gets a share to support themselves. The highest officers get big villages or towns to help them.

A really good minister watches over all these officers to make sure everything is fair.  Each town also has its own officer to take care of things.  The highest officer is like a super-important leader who watches everyone below them, even using secret spies!

The king should know what people are buying and selling, and how the roads are.  He should watch the farmers and shopkeepers to see how much they make.  The king can take taxes, but he shouldn't take so much that people can't live comfortably.  He shouldn't take taxes without knowing how much work went into making things. People won't work hard if they get nothing in return. The king should take just enough so he and his people both have enough.

Think of it like a mother cow and her calf. If the calf drinks too much milk, it gets weak.  If the king takes too many taxes, his people get weak, and the kingdom becomes weak too.  A good king takes care of his people, and they'll help him in return. He should be kind and help his people when they're poor. He should protect them from robbers.

If there's a war coming, the king can ask for extra taxes to protect everyone. He should explain to them why he needs the money. The king should promise to give it back.  He should be fair and kind. He should make sure the shopkeepers and farmers – the Vaisyas – are safe and happy. They make the kingdom strong!  He should take only a small amount from them so they keep working hard. The happiest people make the strongest kingdom!"
