Arjuna saw his brother, Yudhishthira, very sad.  Yudhishthira was so upset about all the people who died in the big battle.  Arjuna asked Krishna, a very powerful and kind friend, to help cheer Yudhishthira up.  He said, "Yudhishthira is heartbroken! Please help him."

Krishna, who was very close to Yudhishthira, went to him. He gently took Yudhishthira's hand.  Krishna smiled, his face shining like a bright lotus flower.  He said, "Yudhishthira, don't be so sad.  It's true, many brave warriors died in the battle. But they were great heroes. They fought bravely, facing their enemies. They didn't run away.  They went to a happy place after the battle."

Krishna told Yudhishthira a story.  He told him about many great kings from long ago.  These kings were very powerful and kind. They gave away lots of gold and food to help people. They were amazing, but even they died.  He talked about King Marutta who even won a battle against the king of the gods!  He spoke about King Suhotra whose kingdom rained gold!  And King Sivi who was so brave and generous.  He told stories of many other brave, kind kings, each one powerful and generous, but each one who died too.

Krishna said, "Even the greatest kings, the kindest kings, the bravest kingsâ€¦ even they died.  Death happens to everyone.  Don't be sad for those who died fighting bravely."

Krishna's stories helped Yudhishthira feel a little better. Krishna reminded Yudhishthira that even great kings, even kings who did wonderful things, died too. This showed Yudhishthira that death is a part of life, and being sad wouldn't bring back the fallen warriors.
