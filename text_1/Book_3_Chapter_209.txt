Once upon a time, a wise king named Yudhishthira listened to a story.  A hunter, a really good person, was talking to a holy man.

The hunter said, "People start by wanting to learn things.  But then, they get caught up in wanting things!  They want fun and beautiful things.  Then they get greedy. Then they get jealous.  Soon, they forget what's really important."

He explained, "Greedy people aren't kind. They cheat to get rich. They get used to doing bad things.  When good people tell them to stop, they make excuses. They do bad things in their hearts, with their words, and with their actions. They lose all their good qualities. They only make friends with other bad people, and they become unhappy."

The hunter then talked about good people.  "Good people know the difference between right and wrong. They are kind. They listen to wise people.  They always try to do what's right."

The holy man said, "You're so wise! You explain things better than anyone else!"

The hunter bowed. He said, "We should always respect holy people. They are very important.  Let me tell you about the world.  The whole world—the earth, air, water, fire, and sky—is made by Brahma, a powerful being. There's nothing bigger! Everything has qualities:  things we can smell, taste, touch, see, and hear. Everything is connected.  There are seventeen things that make us who we are, things like our mind, our senses, and our feelings. I’ve told you about them all. What else do you want to know?"
