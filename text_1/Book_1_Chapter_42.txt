Once upon a time, a wise man named Samika lived in the forest.  His son, Sringin, was a very serious young man who loved to pray.  One day, King Parikshit was not very nice to Samika. He put a dead snake on Samika's shoulders!

Samika was kind. He forgave the king. But Sringin was angry. He shouted, "King Parikshit, you will be killed by a snake in seven days!"  It was a powerful curse.

Samika tried to stop his son.  He said, "Sringin, my child, anger is not good.  Be peaceful. Forgiveness is better." But Sringin wouldn't change his mind.  He said, "A curse is a curse, Father.  I always tell the truth."

Samika, worried for the king, sent his student, Gaurmukha, to tell Parikshit about the curse.  Gaurmukha went to the palace and told the king everything.

King Parikshit was very, very sorry. He knew he had been wrong. To protect himself, he built a special tower with only one way in. He kept doctors and wise men nearby, hoping they could save him.

On the seventh day, a very clever and kind man, Kasyapa, was rushing to help the king. He wanted to cure him after the snake bite.  But Takshaka, the snake who was going to kill the king, saw Kasyapa.

Takshaka, who looked like an old man, stopped Kasyapa and said, "I am Takshaka! I will kill the king. You can't help him."

Kasyapa bravely said, "I'm very wise! I *can* help the king!"  

What will happen next?  Will Takshaka kill the king? Will Kasyapa save him?  We'll have to find out!
