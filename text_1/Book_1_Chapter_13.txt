Once upon a time, a great king named Janamejaya decided to kill all the snakes!  He was going to do this with a special fire ceremony.  A wise man named Saunaka wanted to know why.  He asked Sauti, a storyteller, to explain.

Sauti said, "This is a long story, but I'll tell you!"  The story was about a brave young man named Astika, who saved the snakes.

Saunaka was excited to hear about Astika, a very good and holy man. Sauti explained that he learned the story from his father, who learned it from the great storyteller Vyasa.

Astika's father, Jaratkaru, was a very, very holy man. He was so focused on being good that he forgot about having a family.  He lived a simple life, eating very little and praying a lot.  One day, he saw his ancestors trapped in a hole!

They were hanging upside down!  They explained that because Jaratkaru didn't have children, their family line was in danger of ending.  They begged him to get married and have a son.

Jaratkaru was sad for his ancestors. He promised to get married, not for himself, but to save his family. He decided to marry a girl whose name was the same as his, if he could find one who'd be given to him as a gift.  He wanted to have a son so his ancestors could be free.  Then, the story continued...
