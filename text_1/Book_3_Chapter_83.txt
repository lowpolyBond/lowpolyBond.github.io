Long ago, in a land far away, a wise man named Pulastya told a king a wonderful secret. He said, "King, there's a special place called Kurukshetra.  It's so holy that just being there washes away all your bad deeds!"

He explained that even the dust from Kurukshetra, carried on the wind, could bring good luck.  People who lived near Kurukshetra, between two rivers, the Saraswati and Drishadwati, were like they lived in heaven!  "Stay there for a month," Pulastya advised. "Gods, magical beings, and even dragons visit this sacred place!"

Pulastya then told the king about many other special places nearby.  He said if you visited these places and bathed in their holy waters, it would be like performing amazing good deeds, like giving away tons of cows or performing grand sacrifices!  Each place had its own special magic.

One place, he said, was made holy by a brave hero named Rama. Rama had fought a big battle and, to honor his ancestors, he filled some lakes with the blood of his enemies.  The gods were so pleased that they turned those lakes into holy places. Bathing there and remembering Rama would bring good things.

Pulastya continued describing many other holy places, each with its own story and blessings.  Some helped you look beautiful, some brought you good luck, some even made you wise! He talked about places where gods and goddesses lived, and where you could make wishes come true.

Finally, Pulastya reminded the king about Kurukshetra, the most important place. "Even saying, 'I will go to Kurukshetra,' makes you better," he said.  "It's like a giant, holy playground for the gods themselves!"

The king listened carefully. He knew that visiting these holy places would bring him great blessings and make him a better person.  And so, he set off on his journey.
