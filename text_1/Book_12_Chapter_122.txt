Once upon a time, in a land called Anga, lived a very good king named Vasuhoma. He and his queen were very holy. They prayed a lot and lived simply on a high mountain near a big, shady banyan tree. This place was called Munjaprishtha, and wise people and gods loved it.

One day, a great king named Mandhatri visited Vasuhoma. Mandhatri was very humble.  Vasuhoma welcomed him with clean water and asked about his kingdom.  Then, Mandhatri asked Vasuhoma a big question: "What is Chastisement? Where did it come from, and why is it important?"

Vasuhoma smiled and told Mandhatri a story.  He said that long ago, the great god Brahman wanted to have a special ceremony, but he couldn't find a priest good enough.  So, he kept a special baby growing inside his head for a thousand years!  Finally, he sneezed, and the baby, named Kshupa, fell out. Kshupa became a powerful priest.

But when the ceremony started, something strange happened.  Chastisement, the power that keeps everything in order, disappeared!  The world became a mess!  People fought, stole, and did bad things.  There were no rules!

So Brahman prayed to another god, Vishnu, for help. Vishnu created Chastisement again!  He made rules and chose leaders for everything: Indra for the gods, Yama for the ancestors, and many more. He even gave the power of Chastisement to Kshupa.  Kshupa then passed it down through many important people, eventually to kings.

Vasuhoma explained that Chastisement isn't about being mean. It's about being fair and making sure everyone follows the rules.  It's about protecting good people and stopping bad things.  A good king uses Chastisement wisely, not to be cruel, but to keep peace and order.

Bhishma, who told this story, said anyone who listened and followed this teaching would be very lucky.  That's the story of Chastisement!  It's like the power of doing what's right and keeping the world safe.
