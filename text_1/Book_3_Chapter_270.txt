Once upon a time, during a big war, Jayadratha, a naughty king, ran away from the brave brothers, Bhima and Arjuna.  Bhima was very angry! He caught Jayadratha, tossed him around, and gave him a good beating.  Arjuna stopped Bhima because their king, Yudhishthira, had promised to be kind.

Bhima was still mad.  He shaved Jayadratha's head, leaving only five tufts of hair!  Then, Bhima said, "If you want to live, you must say you are our slave!"  Jayadratha, scared and hurt, agreed.

Bhima and Arjuna chained Jayadratha and took him to Yudhishthira. The king, smiling, told Bhima to let Jayadratha go free. But Bhima wanted Draupadi, their sister-in-law, to know that Jayadratha was their slave.  Everyone, even Draupadi, agreed that Jayadratha should be freed.

Yudhishthira, a very kind king, told Jayadratha, "You are free now, but don't be naughty again!  Trying to take someone by force is wrong!"

Jayadratha felt very ashamed. He went to a holy place and prayed to Lord Shiva, a very powerful god.  He asked for a wish â€“ to defeat the Pandava brothers in battle!

Lord Shiva said, "You can't defeat them completely. Only Arjuna, who is very, very strong and protected by a powerful god, is unbeatable.  You can only stop them for one single day!"

Lord Shiva then disappeared with his wife, Parvati. Jayadratha went home, feeling sad and humbled. The Pandava brothers stayed in the forest.
