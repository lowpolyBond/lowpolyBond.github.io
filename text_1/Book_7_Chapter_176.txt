Once upon a time, during a big battle, a powerful giant named Alayudha arrived.  He was a Rakshasa, a kind of giant. He was very angry!  Alayudha’s family had been killed by Bhima, one of the Pandava brothers.  Bhima had even hurt Alayudha’s sister.

Alayudha wanted revenge.  He marched to Duryodhana, the leader of the Kauravas (the other side in the battle), with lots of other angry Rakshasas.  He told Duryodhana, "Bhima killed my family! I want to fight him!"

Duryodhana was happy.  "Fight him!" he shouted.  "My army will help you!"

Alayudha had a super cool chariot! It was bright like the sun, just like the chariot of Ghatotkacha, Bhima's son. It was pulled by a hundred giant, super-fast horses that sounded like donkeys! Alayudha was big and strong, even stronger than Ghatotkacha. He had a scary look, with bright jewelry and weapons.

Alayudha roared and charged into battle!  The Pandavas’ best warriors, all ready for a fight, bravely faced the giant and his army. The battle was about to begin!
