Arjuna was confused. He asked Krishna, "What is Brahman, the highest truth? What is Adhyatma, our inner self?  What is action, and what are Adhibhuta (the material world), Adhidaiva (the world of gods), and Adhiyajna (the act of sacrifice)? Most importantly, how can I find you when I die?"

Krishna, the wise one, explained. "Brahman is the greatest, unbreakable truth.  Adhyatma is Brahman within each of us.  Action is anything we do, especially good deeds that help others.

"When you die, if you remember me, you will come to me.  Think of whoever you love most in your final moments, and that’s where you will go.  So always think of me!”

Krishna continued, "To reach me fully, focus your mind completely on me.  Think of me with all your heart. Imagine a peaceful light between your eyebrows. Think of me, the smallest and biggest thing ever, the one who is unseen, the one who created everything. Focus on the sound 'Om', which is like a doorway to Brahman."

Krishna described a secret: "There is a place where good people go after death and never return. It’s my home.  But there’s another path—a path that leads people back to the world.  Think of it like this: going towards the sun is one way and going towards the moon is another. One path leads to me forever, the other path brings you back to Earth. Remember the sun and moon, it will always guide you."


Krishna said, “If you do good things, study holy books, and be kind, you will get to my home.  Always remember me, Arjuna, and you will find peace."
