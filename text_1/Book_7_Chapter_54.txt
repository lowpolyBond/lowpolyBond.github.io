Oops!  It looks like a part of the story is missing!  That's like when you're reading a book and a page is ripped out.  We don't know what happened in that part of the Mahabharata story.  Maybe someone accidentally lost it a long, long time ago!  We'll have to imagine what might have happened there.  Maybe we'll find it someday!
