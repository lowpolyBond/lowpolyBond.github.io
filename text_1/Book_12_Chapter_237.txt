Once upon a time, wise Vyasa told a story about a long journey across a stormy sea.  He said that people who want to be happy and peaceful need a special raft: Knowledge.  This raft helps them reach a peaceful shore where they're free from worries.

Suka, a young boy, asked, "What is this Knowledge?"

Vyasa explained, "It's not just learning facts.  It's understanding how to live a good life, doing the right things, and knowing what not to do.  It helps you avoid sadness and pain."

Vyasa then talked about some people who thought everything happened by chance, and others who thought everything had a reason.  But neither group was truly happy.  He said true happiness comes from wisdom.

He explained that wisdom helps us grow food, build homes, make medicines, and even become good leaders.  Wisdom helps us understand everything in the world, from the smallest plants to the biggest animals.

Vyasa said that all living things are special in their own way.  Animals that walk are better than animals that can't. Animals with two legs are better than animals with many legs. Humans are even better!  But the best humans are the ones who are kind, follow the rules, and learn from wise teachers.

The wisest people are those who understand the Vedas, ancient holy books.  They teach others, and they understand about life and death.  They know that the most important thing is to be good and kind.

Vyasa said that these wise people see the world differently. They see that they are part of everything, and everything is part of them.  These wise people are like gods! They are free from worry and sadness.  They are the best of all beings.  The whole world depends on them!
