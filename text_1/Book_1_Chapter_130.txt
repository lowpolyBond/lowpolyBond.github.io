Once upon a time, a brave king named Janamejaya wanted to know a secret.  He asked a wise man, "Tell me the story of Kripa! How was he born?"

The wise man began, "Long ago, there was a very strong warrior named Saradwat. He was amazing with a bow and arrow!  He was so good, even the King of the Gods, Indra, was scared of him!"

Indra was worried. He sent a beautiful fairy, Janapadi, to distract Saradwat.  Janapadi was so beautiful that Saradwat dropped his bow and arrow! He was surprised and shy.  A tiny bit of his magic power fell on some bushes.  Amazingly, two babies, a boy and a girl, popped out!

One day, King Santanu was hunting in the forest. A soldier found the babies near a bow and arrow. He thought they must belong to a warrior. He brought them to the King.

King Santanu felt sorry for the babies. He took them home, calling them Kripa and Kripi, which means “pity.”  He loved and cared for them.

Later, Saradwat, the babies' father, found them. He taught Kripa everything he knew about fighting and weapons. Kripa became the best warrior teacher ever!  The princes of the Pandavas and Kauravas, and many others, learned from him.  He was incredibly strong and wise, all because of a magical start!
