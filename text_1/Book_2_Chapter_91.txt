Once upon a time, Prince Bharata went to visit a wise old sage named Bharadvaja.  Bharata was happy with simple food â€“ some fruit and berries.

But the sage wanted to treat Bharata's whole army!  He asked, "Why did you come alone, Prince? Where is your army?"

Bharata explained, "My army is very big.  I didn't bring them because I didn't want their elephants and horses to mess up your home!"

The sage smiled. "Bring them here!" he said.

Whoosh!  With magic, the sage made a huge feast appear!  He called upon the gods!  Vishvakarma, the god of builders, made beautiful houses and stables.  Indra, the king of the gods, and other gods helped too!  Rivers flowed with sweet drinks.  Heavenly dancers and musicians came to play.

The whole area changed! It was covered in bright green grass, with lovely trees and sparkling streams.  There were amazing palaces, delicious food, and comfy places to rest.

Bharata's army was amazed! They had everything they could ever want:  tasty food, cool drinks, and beautiful women to massage them.  Their horses and elephants got special treats too!

Everyone ate, drank, danced, and sang.  They were so happy, they forgot all about going home! They even said, "Let's stay here forever!"

The next morning, the gods went home.  But Bharata's army was still sleepy from all the fun.  Everywhere they looked, there were flower garlands and happy memories of their amazing feast!
