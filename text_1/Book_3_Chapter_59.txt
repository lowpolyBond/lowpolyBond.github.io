Once upon a time, there was a very good king named Nala.  A sneaky spirit named Kali wanted to trick him. Kali made a deal with another spirit, and waited a long, long time for his chance.

Finally, King Nala made a tiny mistake. He forgot to wash his feet before praying!  That's all Kali needed.  He zoomed right into King Nala!

Now, controlled by Kali, King Nala was not himself anymore. Kali made him want to play a dice game with a man named Pushkara.  Pushkara was cheating!  He had another spirit helping him win.

"Let's play dice, Nala!" Pushkara said.  Nala, controlled by Kali, couldn't say no.  Even his beautiful wife, Damayanti, couldn't stop him.

Nala started losing!  First, he lost all his gold. Then his silver.  Then his fancy carriages and beautiful clothes!  He just kept playing, even though everyone begged him to stop.

His friends and the people of the kingdom came to see what was happening. They were very sad.  Damayanti, his wife, cried and begged him to stop, but Nala couldn't hear her. He was completely under Kali's control.

The people went home, heartbroken.  They thought their king was lost forever.  Nala, tricked by Kali, kept playing dice and losing for many, many months.  It was a very sad time for everyone.
