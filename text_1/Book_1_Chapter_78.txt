Once upon a time, a very clever young man named Kacha learned amazing magic in the sky-city of the gods.  The gods were so happy! They learned his magic too.  Then, they told Kacha, "It's time to show off your skills! Go fight your enemies!"

Kacha was happy to do this. But on his way, he saw some girls playing by a lake.  He was a bit naughty and played a trick. He turned into the wind and mixed up all their clothes!

When the girls got out of the water, they couldnâ€™t find their clothes! Two girls, Devayani and Sarmishtha, argued about whose clothes were whose.

Devayani said, "Sarmishtha, those are my clothes! You're being mean!"

Sarmishtha was bossy. She said, "My father is much more important than yours!  He gets gifts, your father only asks for them!"  She was very rude and pushed Devayani into a deep well! She thought Devayani was dead and went home.

King Yayati was hunting nearby.  His horses were tired, and he was thirsty. He saw the well and looked inside. He saw a beautiful girl, Devayani, at the bottom!

"Who are you?" asked the kind king.

"I'm Devayani, the daughter of Sukra, a great and powerful man," she said. "Please, help me out!"

King Yayati helped Devayani out of the well.  He was very polite, but then he went home.

Devayani was still sad and angry. She told her friend, Ghurnika, to go tell her father, Sukra, what happened.

Ghurnika ran to Sukra and told him everything. Sukra was furious! He rushed to find Devayani and hugged her.

"My dear daughter," he said, "bad things happen, but you are not to blame.  Sarmishtha was very unkind."

Devayani was still upset.  "Sarmishtha said you are just someone who asks for gifts!" she cried.

Sukra smiled. "My dear, that's not true! I am a very important and powerful person, even more important than Sarmishtha's father!" He told Devayani how powerful and respected he really was.  He made her feel much better.
