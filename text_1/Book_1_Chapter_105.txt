Long ago, in a kingdom far away, King Vichitravirya died without any children.  His wise brother, Bhishma, was very sad.  He wanted the royal family to continue.

Bhishma spoke to his stepmother, Queen Satyavati. "Mother," he said, "we need a wise man to help us."

Satyavati smiled.  She had a secret.  When she was young, she was rowing a boat on the river Yamuna. A very powerful wise man, Rishi Parasara, needed a ride.  She was scared, but she helped him.  He gave her a magical gift â€“ a baby boy.  This boy grew up to be a very great and wise man named Vyasa.

Satyavati told Bhishma about Vyasa.  "He's my son," she said. "He's very powerful and wise.  He can help us."

Bhishma agreed. He said it was a good idea.  Satyavati called Vyasa.  She hugged him and cried happy tears.  She hadn't seen him in a long time.

Vyasa promised to help.  He would have children with his younger brother's two widows. Satyavati explained that this was important to keep the family going and keep the kingdom safe.

Vyasa said he would help, but the queens had to be very pure and follow special rules.  He would help them have strong and healthy sons.

Satyavati explained everything to the queens. The queens agreed to help save the kingdom.

Vyasa then performed a special ritual, making sure the queens would have children. And that's how the Bharata family continued!  The queens had sons, thanks to Vyasa's help and everyone's good plans.
