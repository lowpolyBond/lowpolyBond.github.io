Once upon a time, there was a king named Janamejaya.  He was strong and brave, but he made a terrible mistake.  He accidentally killed a holy man, a Brahmin.

The other Brahmins were very upset. They left him.  Janamejaya felt awful.  He was very, very sorry.

So, he went to live in the forest all alone. He wanted to be better. He prayed and did hard things to show how sorry he was. He asked many wise people how to be forgiven.

One day, he met a very holy man named Indrota.  Janamejaya bowed down and asked for help.

Indrota was sad to see the king.  He said, "King, you did a bad thing. You hurt a holy man. You made your family sad.  Your ancestors are sad, too!"

Indrota told Janamejaya that because of his mistake, he would suffer.  He might even have to go to a bad place after he died, a place full of scary birds with sharp beaks. He said Janamejayaâ€™s life was like a shadow, full of unhappiness.

Indrota's words made Janamejaya even sadder, but they also helped him understand how serious his mistake was.  This story shows us that even kings can make mistakes, and that being truly sorry and trying to be better is important.
