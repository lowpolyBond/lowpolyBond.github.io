Once upon a time, in a forest called Khandava, Arjuna and his friend Krishna were helping Agni, the fire god, burn down the forest.  Indra, the king of the gods, didn't want the forest to burn. He sent a huge rain storm to put out the fire!

But Arjuna was super strong! He shot so many arrows into the sky, it looked like a cloudy night.  No rain could get through!

A big snake, Aswasena, was trapped in the fire. His mom tried to save him by swallowing him whole!  But Arjuna, seeing this, quickly shot an arrow and saved the forest.  Indra was angry, and he made Arjuna sleepy for a moment.  Aswasena got away!

Arjuna was furious! He cut up any animal trying to escape.  He, Agni, and Krishna were so mad at the sneaky snake, they wished the snake would never be famous!

Indra, the god king, was still angry.  He sent a huge storm, with thunder and lightning!  But Arjuna had a special arrow that stopped the storm completely. The sun shone again!

Agni was happy.  But then, big scary birds and snakes came to attack Arjuna and Krishna!  Arjuna shot them all down with his fiery arrows.

Next, lots of other monsters—Asuras, Yakshas, and Rakshasas—came to fight! They threw rocks and iron balls, but Arjuna and Krishna were too strong. They fought back, cutting the monsters into pieces!

Indra, still trying to stop them, threw his powerful thunderbolt!  All the other gods joined in! They threw maces, clubs, spears, and even a mountain!  It looked like the end of the world!

But Arjuna and Krishna were brave. They fought back with even more arrows. Finally, all the gods ran away. Indra kept trying, even throwing a whole mountain at Arjuna!  But Arjuna sliced the mountain into pieces with his arrows!  The falling mountain finished burning the forest, killing many creatures.  And that’s how the Khandava forest burned to the ground!
