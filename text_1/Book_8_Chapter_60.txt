Sanjaya told Arjuna, "Look! Your brother, Yudhishthira, is in trouble!  Lots of Kaurava soldiers are trying to capture him.  They want to hurt him badly.

But the brave Pancala warriors are trying to save Yudhishthira!  And Duryodhana, the Kaurava king, is chasing Yudhishthira with his army. He wants to defeat Yudhishthira really badly. Duryodhana's brothers are also there, and their weapons are as dangerous as poisonous snakes!

The Kaurava soldiers are rushing toward Yudhishthira like hungry people after a lost treasure!  But strong warriors like Bhima and Satyaki stopped them for a little while.  Then, the Kauravas came back again, as many as a huge river flowing to the ocean. They shouted and blew their horns, and shook their bows!

Yudhishthira is in great danger!  Duryodhana's army is so strong, even the gods would have trouble fighting them!  Duryodhana, Karna, Drona, and Kripa are amazing warriors; their arrows could break mountains!  Karna even made Yudhishthira turn and run away before!  Karna is super strong and fast. He's very good at fighting.

Yudhishthira is tired from fasting, and isn't as strong as he usually is.  He's in big danger with Karna attacking him! I fear Yudhishthira is already dead.  Even Bhima, who is very strong, can only hear the Kauravas shouting and blowing their horns. Karna is using his strongest weapons against Yudhishthira!

The Pancala and Pandava warriors are rushing to save Yudhishthira as fast as they can, like people trying to rescue someone drowning in the deep sea.  But Karna is destroying everything! He's like a huge elephant destroying beautiful lotus flowers! Many Pandava soldiers are running away.  Karna's elephant flag is everywhere!  He's attacking Bhima and defeating the Pancala soldiers.  Karna is looking for you, Arjuna! He looks very strong and beautiful like a god.  He's making the Pandava soldiers afraid.

He's shouting at his soldiers to attack and kill the Pandavas. Karna is very powerful and brave. He hates you and wants to defeat you very much!  Duryodhana is protecting Karna, but you must defeat them both. You are both very strong.  Fight Karna, Arjuna, as a god fights a demon!  Duryodhana won’t be able to do anything when he sees you both fighting so hard!  Think of your strong heart and how much Karna hates your brother, Yudhishthira. Fight him!

A huge army – five hundred great warriors, five thousand elephants, and even more horses and soldiers – is coming towards you! Go fight Karna! But wait… I have good news! Yudhishthira is still alive!

Bhima has returned! He’s fighting the Kauravas with the Pancalas. They are defeating the Kauravas!  The Kaurava army is running away, covered in blood.  The battlefield is a terrible mess!  Bhima is fighting like a wild snake, defeating thousands of soldiers. Flags, elephants, and horses are all scattered everywhere. The Pancalas are incredibly brave. They're picking up weapons from fallen soldiers and fighting back. They're incredibly strong and loud, attacking the Kauravas without fear. Even great warriors like Kripa and Karna are having a hard time.  The Pancalas are destroying the Kaurava army!

Bhima is even defeating huge elephants. He's roaring so loudly!  A Nishada prince is trying to kill Yudhishthira, but Bhima cut off his arms!  Bhima is killing so many elephants, cutting down their flags. The Kauravas are not shouting anymore! Bhima defeated three whole armies by himself!  Then Arjuna defeated the rest of the soldiers."
