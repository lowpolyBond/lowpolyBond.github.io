Once upon a time, during a big battle in the Mahabharata, five brave brothers fought a strong warrior.  This warrior, the son of Somadatta, was very skilled with his bow and arrow.  He shot five arrows at each brother, then seven more! The brothers were surprised, but then Nakula's son, Satanika, shot back, hitting the enemy warrior.  The other brothers joined in, each shooting three arrows.

The son of Somadatta shot back, hitting each brother in the chest. But the brothers were very brave! They surrounded him and shot him with many arrows.  Arjuna's son even shot the enemy warrior's horses!  Then, Bhima's son broke the enemy warrior's bow and shot him again and again.  Yudhishthira's son knocked down the enemy's flag. Nakula's son knocked the enemy's driver off his chariot. Finally, Sahadeva's son cut off the enemy warrior's head! The enemy's army was scared and ran away.


Next, a powerful demon named Alamvusha fought Bhima.  It was a very exciting fight!  Bhima shot Alamvusha with nine arrows, but Alamvusha was strong. He shot back, destroying many of Bhima's chariots.  He even hit Bhima, and Bhima fainted!

But Bhima wasn't defeated! He woke up, very angry. He shot Alamvusha with many arrows. Alamvusha, remembering how Bhima killed his brother, got very angry too. He changed his shape again and again. Sometimes he was small, sometimes huge. He even made it rain arrows, darts, and other weapons from the sky!  Many soldiers and animals died.  A river even formed, made of blood and broken things!

The Pandava army was worried, but Bhima was even angrier. He used a special weapon that defeated Alamvusha's magic tricks. Alamvusha ran away, defeated by the mighty Bhima. The Pandava brothers were so happy that they cheered loudly! They were very proud of Bhima.
