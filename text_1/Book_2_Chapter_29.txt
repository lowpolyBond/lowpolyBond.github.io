Rama told Sita they would live in the forest. Sita was very sad.  Tears ran down her face.

"Rama," she whispered, "I don't mind the forest!  Being with you makes everything happy.  Even scary animals like lions and elephants will be afraid of you!  My family always said I should be with you. I can't live without you!  With you, I'm safe, even from powerful gods!  A wise person once told me I would live in the forest. I've been waiting for this! I want to go with you, Rama. It'll be wonderful! Please let me come!"

Sita explained that a kind woman predicted she'd live in the forest. She'd even asked Rama to play in the woods with her before!  "This is the time for that prediction to come true! Please, let me go with you!  Serving you will be my greatest joy!  I'll be happy to go, even though it's hard. Being with you washes away all my bad feelings. You're my only god. I don't want to go to heaven without you!  A good Brahmin told me that a wife stays with her husband, even after death. I'll share all your hard times, Rama. I'll be happy or sad depending on you. Please, take me! If you won't, I'll rather die."

Sita begged Rama to take her. But Rama still said no. Sita was heartbroken. Tears fell onto the ground.  Rama saw how upset she was, but he still tried to change her mind.
