Once upon a time, in a land far away, lived a king named Yudhishthira. He was a good and thoughtful king, always wanting to do what was right. He asked his friend Sanjaya, "Sanjaya, is it always easy to know what's right and what's wrong? Sometimes, doing what seems good can actually be bad, and doing something that looks bad might actually be good!"

Sanjaya agreed.  He said, "It's especially hard during tough times!  We should always try our best to follow the rules of our family and our life. But if we're in trouble and need food or shelter, we might have to do things a little differently."

Yudhishthira thought about this. He said, "Even if things get really, really hard, I don't want to do anything wrong to get what I need.  There's something even more important than food or riches."

Yudhishthira knew a very wise man named Krishna. Krishna was very smart and kind. He helped everyone, even people fighting against each other. Yudhishthira decided to ask Krishna what to do.

"Krishna," he said, "Should I try to make peace, or should I fight?  Is it wrong to fight even if my family is in danger?"

Many powerful kings followed Krishna’s advice. They won battles and were happy. Even Vabhru, the king of Kasi, became super successful thanks to Krishna's help!  

Yudhishthira looked up to Krishna.  "Krishna is very wise," said Yudhishthira. "I will always listen to him. I will never do anything bad, even if I'm scared or in trouble. I won't steal or cheat, not for anything in the whole world—not even for heaven itself!"
