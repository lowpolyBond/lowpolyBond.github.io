King Dhritarashtra was very sad.  He asked his friend Sanjaya, "Sanjaya, so many of my sons are dead!  They were killed by just one person! What did our best warriors – Bhishma, Drona, and Kripa – do?  My sons keep dying every day! It's like bad luck is following them. They never win!"

Dhritarashtra continued, "Even with brave warriors like Bhishma, Drona, Kripa, and many others fighting alongside them, my sons are still losing. It must be fate! My son Duryodhana wouldn't listen to anyone – not me, not Bhishma, not even Vidura!  He was stubborn and made bad choices. Now, Bhima is angry and keeps killing my sons in battle!"

Sanjaya answered, "King, remember Vidura’s wise words? He told you to stop your sons from fighting. You didn’t listen, just like someone who refuses medicine.  The good advice you ignored has come true. The Kauravas are being defeated because they didn't listen.  Now, I'll tell you about the battle."

"The battle was terrible! The Pandavas, led by Yudhishthira, attacked Bhishma.  Many brave warriors fought against him.  Arjuna and his cousins fought Duryodhana’s army. Bhima fought fiercely, like a second god of death!  Drona also fought hard, but the Pandavas were very strong.  The battlefield was filled with the sounds of pain – screams, cries, and groans.  So much blood flowed, it was like a river!  Bhima even fought the Kaurava elephants, cutting them down. Nakula and Sahadeva fought the cavalry, killing many horses.  The ground was covered with dead soldiers and horses, broken chariots, and weapons. It was a terrible, bloody mess!"

Sanjaya finished, "King, both armies suffered greatly.  The Pandavas won because they fought hard, but the Kauravas suffered terribly because of Duryodhana's mistakes."
