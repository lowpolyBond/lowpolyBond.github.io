King Yudhishthira, listen to what Bhishma is about to tell you!  A long time ago, the god of death, Yama, taught King Sasavindu about special ceremonies called Sraddhas. These ceremonies are done to honor ancestors.  They're even better if you do them under certain stars!

Imagine the stars as magical helpers!

* If you do your Sraddha under the Krittika star, it's like doing a super-special fire ceremony. You'll go to heaven, and your kids will too!
* Want lots of kids? Do it under Rohini!
* Need more energy? Try Mrigasiras.
* The Ardra star makes you brave and strong.
* Punarvasu helps you become a good farmer.
* Want to be successful?  Do it under Pushya!
* Aslesha helps you have strong and brave children.
* Maghas makes you the most important person in your family.
* Phalgunis (both the early and late ones!) bring good luck and lots of children!
* If you want your wishes to come true, try Hasta.
* Chitra gives you beautiful children.
* Swati makes you great at trading.
* Visakha is another star that helps you have children.
* Anuradha makes you a very powerful king!
* Jyeshtha?  Be kind and humble, and youâ€™ll become a ruler!
* Mula keeps you healthy.
* Ashadha (both early and late) brings you fame and lets you travel the world!
* Abhijit makes you super smart.
* Sravana helps you have a wonderful afterlife.
* Dhanishtha makes you a ruler of a kingdom.
* Satabhisha helps you become a great doctor.
* Bhadrapada (early) gives you lots of goats and sheep.
* Bhadrapada (late) gives you tons of cows!
* Revati brings you lots of shiny brass and copper things.
* Aswini brings you many fast horses!
* Bharani helps you live a long, long time.
