King Dhritarashtra was worried.  "Satyaki, a super strong warrior, fought bravely," he said. "But Bhurisravas, a Kuru warrior,  threw him to the ground! How could this happen?"

Sanjaya, Dhritarashtra's advisor, explained. "Let me tell you a story, King.  It all goes back a long, long time ago.  There was a family, the Vrishnis,  amazing warriors!  Satyaki was from that family.

"A long time ago, there was a big contest.  Sini, Satyaki's ancestor, won the hand of Princess Devaki.  Another strong man, Somadatta, was very angry. They fought! Sini won, and Somadatta was very upset.

Somadatta prayed to a powerful god. He asked for a son who would defeat Sini's family one day.  The god said, "Okay!"  That son was Bhurisravas. That's why Bhurisravas was able to defeat Satyaki.

"The Vrishnis are incredibly strong," Sanjaya continued. "They are unbeatable! No one can defeat them, not even gods or demons! They are kind, brave, and always help others."

Sanjaya finished, "King, all this fighting is because of your bad choices."
