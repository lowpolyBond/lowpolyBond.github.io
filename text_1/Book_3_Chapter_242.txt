Once upon a time, the Pandava brothers heard their cousin, Duryodhana, was in trouble!  He'd been captured by some powerful Gandharva warriors.  Yudhishthira, the eldest Pandava, said, "We have to rescue him!"

Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva were so happy to help. They quickly put on their shiny, golden armor and grabbed their magical weapons.  They looked like fiery heroes, riding in their amazing chariots!

When the Kuru army saw the Pandavas coming, they cheered loudly.  The Pandavas bravely rushed into the forest where the Gandharvas were.  The Gandharvas were surprised to see them!  They were winning the battle already, but the sight of the four brave Pandavas made them stop for a moment.

Arjuna, the best archer, tried to be nice first.  He asked the Gandharvas politely, "Please let my cousin Duryodhana go!"

But the Gandharvas laughed.  "We only listen to our own king," they said.  "No one else can tell us what to do!"

Arjuna wasn't happy. "It's not right for your king to kidnap people and fight humans," he said.  "Let Duryodhana and the other prisoners go! Free the women too, as Yudhishthira commanded. If you don't, I'll have to fight!"

Arjuna then shot many powerful arrows at the Gandharvas.  The Gandharvas fought back with their own arrows.  A huge battle began!  It was a very, very fierce fight between the powerful Pandavas and the amazing Gandharva warriors!
