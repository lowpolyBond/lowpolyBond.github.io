One morning, after praying, a wise man named Dhaumya and his friend Arshtishena visited the Pandava brothers.  The Pandavas bowed respectfully.  Dhaumya took Yudhishthira's hand and pointed east.

"Look, mighty king!" Dhaumya said. "See Mount Mandara? It's huge! It stretches far and wide, all the way to the ocean.  Indra, the king of the gods, and Vaisravana, the king of the treasures, live there.  Wise people say this is a holy place."

He pointed to other directions. "Over there, in the south," he explained, "lives Yama, the king of the dead. His kingdom is called Sanyamana.  It's a very special place."

Dhaumya then pointed north. "See Mount Meru? It's even bigger and more beautiful than Mandara! Brahma, the creator of the universe, lives there, along with many other gods and goddesses.  Even Brahma's seven sons live on Meru!"

"And beyond Brahma's home," Dhaumya whispered, "lives Lord Narayana. He is the very first being, the source of everything.  Even the gods can't see his real home, it's so glorious!"

"Only very holy people, called Yatis, can visit Narayana," Dhaumya said.  "If they go there, they never need to return to this world."

Dhaumya explained how the sun and moon travel around Mount Meru every day.  "The sun brings the warmth and light," he said.  "When the sun goes south, it gets cold – that's winter! When it comes back north, it gets hot again.  The sun brings rain, too, to help everything grow. The sun never rests. It’s always moving, giving life to everything."

The wise man explained how the sun’s movement makes day and night, and all the seasons.  "The sun’s journey shows us how time works," he finished.  "It's a never-ending cycle."
