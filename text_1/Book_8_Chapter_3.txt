Sanjaya told the king, "When the great warrior Drona fell, your sons were very sad.  Their heads drooped. They were too upset to even look at each other. They just stood there silently.  Your soldiers were sad too.  They looked up at the sky, not knowing what to do. Many dropped their weapons; they were covered in blood. Others held their weapons loosely, like falling stars.

King Duryodhana saw his army like this – sad and still. He said, "I thought my army was strong enough to win!  But now Drona is dead, things look bad.  But in war, people die. That’s what happens! Don’t worry! Look at Karna! He's amazing! He’s even scared Arjuna, the Pandava warrior, who's usually so brave. Karna defeated Bhima, and even killed Ghatotkacha! Look at his power! Today, Karna and Ashwatthama will show their strength. You are all strong warriors, each one of you could defeat the Pandavas. But together, you are unstoppable!"

Then Duryodhana made Karna the leader of the army. Karna roared and fought bravely. He attacked many soldiers, from the Srinjayas, Pancalas, Kekayas and Videhas.  Arrows flew from his bow, like a swarm of bees!  He killed many warriors. But finally, Arjuna killed Karna."
