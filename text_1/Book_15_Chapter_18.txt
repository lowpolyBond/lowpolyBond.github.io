Once upon a time, Kunti, the mother of the Pandava brothers, decided to go live in the forest.  She wanted to be peaceful and pray.

The Pandavas, her sons, were very sad.  They tried to convince her to stay.  Even Draupadi, their wife, begged her to change her mind. But Kunti was determined.

The whole kingdom was upset! Everyone cried.  King Dhritarashtra, Kunti's father-in-law, also pleaded with her to stay.  He loved her very much.  His wife, Gandhari, asked her to stay too. But Kunti still wanted to go.

The Pandavas sadly went home without their mother.  Everyone in the city was very, very unhappy. It felt like a dark day.

That night, Dhritarashtra, Gandhari, Kunti, and Vidura (a wise advisor) went to a quiet place near a river.  Many priests were there, and they lit sacred fires.  Everyone prayed and slept peacefully under the stars.

The next morning, they started their journey, but everyone felt sad.  Leaving Kunti behind had made everyone unhappy, even though it was her decision.  It was a hard start to their forest life.
