Once upon a time, a wise man named Tuladhara talked with a priest named Jajali. Jajali worried that Tuladhara’s ideas about how to be good were wrong.  Jajali said, "Your ideas stop people from farming and getting food!  We need animals and plants to live! Without them, the world will end!"

Tuladhara replied, "I'm not against helping others or giving thanks to the gods. But many people do it wrong. They do sacrifices just to get rich, not because it's the right thing to do.  They take things they don't own, and that's bad."

He explained, "Real sacrifices aren't about fancy gifts. They’re about being kind and doing good. The gods are pleased by good deeds, prayers, and singing.  If people are greedy, their children will also be greedy. If they’re kind, their children will be kind, too."

Tuladhara said, "Imagine a rain cloud. The sun helps the rain grow.  Rain helps the food grow.  Food helps people and animals live.  Long ago, people did sacrifices the right way. The earth gave them food easily.  They didn’t do it for rewards."

He added, "People who do sacrifices just to get something in return will be greedy in their next life.  But those who do good things because it’s right, without wanting a reward, are truly good people.  They understand that everything comes from one source –  God."

Tuladhara said, "True sacrifices are things like being honest, kind, and helping others. These are the best things. The best way to please the Gods is to live a good life, doing what is right,  helping others, and never harming anyone."

Jajali was confused. He said, "I've never heard of such ideas! They’re hard to understand!"

Tuladhara said, "Some people do sacrifices badly because they don’t believe in them.  But good sacrifices can be made with simple things, like milk and rice.  Every river is holy, every mountain is holy, and most importantly, your own heart is holy. You don't need to travel far to find sacred places."

Tuladhara continued, "By doing good things, showing kindness, and being honest, we all can find true happiness.  By being good and kind, we please the gods, and we create a better world for everyone.”  This is how Tuladhara showed that being good is more important than fancy ceremonies.
