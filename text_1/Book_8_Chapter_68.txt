Sanjaya said, "Yudhishthira was very angry! He learned that Karna was still alive.  He shouted at Arjuna, "Arjuna! Your army ran away! You were scared of Karna and left Bhima alone!  You didn't kill Karna like you promised!

"You told me in the Dwaita forest that you would kill Karna all by yourself.  Why are you so afraid? If you couldn't fight Karna, you should have told me! We could have made a different plan. You promised to kill Karna, but you didn't!  You led us into danger and now we are in trouble. We trusted you! We thought you were amazing!  But our hopes are gone. It's like getting a tree full of flowers instead of fruit!

"You tricked us!  You promised us victory, but instead we're losing everything. For thirteen years, we hoped and trusted you, just like seeds waiting for rain. A voice from the sky even said you'd be super strong! It said you'd be the best warrior, stronger than anyone!  It said you'd win every battle, and that no one could defeat you! But that wasn't true.  The gods lied!

"You have a great chariot, a strong bow, a powerful sword, and the best driver, Krishna! Why were you afraid of Karna?  You could have given your bow to Krishna, and he could have defeated Karna easily.  Or give your bow to another king if you are scared. 

"Because of you, we might lose everything â€“ our kingdom, our families, and our lives!  It would have been better if you had never been born! You're a disgrace!"
