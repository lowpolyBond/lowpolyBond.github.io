Once upon a time, Kunti, a queen, told Karna a secret:  He was her son!  The sun god, Surya, also spoke to Karna from the sky, telling him to listen to his mother.

But Karna didn't change his mind. He was a loyal friend to the Kauravas,  the princes who were fighting against Kunti's other sons, the Pandavas.

"Mother," Karna said, "you left me when I was a baby.  You didn't care for me then. Now you want me to fight against my friends? That's not fair!  Everyone thinks I'm strong and powerful.  The Kauravas need me to win the war.  I can't let them down."

Karna made a promise:  He wouldn't kill Kunti's other sons except for Arjuna, the best warrior among the Pandavas.  "I'll fight Arjuna," Karna said, "and either I'll win, or I'll die a hero."

Kunti was sad, but she hugged her son.  She knew Karna was brave and strong.  She thanked him for protecting her other sons. Then they went their separate ways.  Karna went back to help his friends, and Kunti went back, knowing a great battle was coming.
