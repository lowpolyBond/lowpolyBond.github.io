The Pandavas were on a long journey.  Yudhishthira, the eldest brother, was worried.  They were near a scary place with invisible spirits!  "Bhima," he said to his strong brother, "this place is dangerous.  Let's use our strength and smarts to get through it.  We'll be safe because we're good and we've done good things."

He had a plan. "Bhima, you're strong! Take Sahadeva, the servants, cooks, and the tired horses and carts back to the Ganga River.  Wait there for me with Draupadi, our sister-in-law. Nakula, Lomasa the wise man, and I will go on ahead."

Bhima, the strongest brother, said, "No way! Draupadi wants to see Arjuna, our brother, just like we do. Sahadeva will stay with us too.  We'll all go together! We'll walk if we have to! I'm strong enough to carry Draupadi and the twins if they get tired."

Yudhishthira was happy. "Bhima, you are amazing! May you always be strong!"  Draupadi smiled and said she could manage, too. Lomasa the wise man said they needed to be very good and follow strict rules to get where they were going.


They met a kind king named Suvahu.  He helped them.  They left their servants and things with him and continued their journey towards the Himalayas.  The sun shone brightly.


Later, Yudhishthira was feeling sad. "Bhima," he said, "I miss Arjuna so much!  We've traveled so far, and all we want is to see him.  The journey is hard, but thinking about Arjuna and how badly he was treated makes it even harder. I miss our brother, he is so strong and kind. We’ve been walking for five years and haven’t found him yet! He is the best archer and he’s so brave and kind. I miss his strength, and his amazing white horses.  He always helps others, he is a great warrior and so much more.  Let's go to Gandhamadana Mountain.  It's said Arjuna is there, near a special tree. Only good people can reach it, we’ll get there by foot and with the help of the gods."


They all agreed to go to the mountain together, to find their brother Arjuna. They walked and walked, and finally, they found their brother.
