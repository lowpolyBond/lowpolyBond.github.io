King Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandpa, what should a king do if he wants more wealth, even though he's already rich?"

Bhishma smiled.  "A good king cares for his people," he said.  "He's like a bee, gently taking honey from flowers, never harming them. He's like a cowherd, carefully milking the cow, making sure the calf gets enough milk too. He takes taxes like a leech â€“ a tiny bit at a time, not sucking the people dry."

"He's like a tigress," Bhishma continued, "gentle with her cubs, holding them carefully in her teeth. Or a clever mouse, quietly nibbling a sleeping animal's feet without waking it.  He takes taxes slowly, a little at a time, from those who can afford it.  He should never take too much, too soon, just like you wouldn't overload a young bull with a heavy cart."

Bhishma explained that a king should treat everyone fairly, but it's okay to be friendlier to the important people.  He should stop bad things like gambling and drinking, because those hurt everyone. He added that nobody should ask for help unless they're really in trouble. Everyone should work hard.  A king who lets bad things happen in his kingdom shares the blame.

"A king should help those who are poor, but never out of fear," Bhishma said. "He should make sure there are no beggars or thieves.  Good people should live in his kingdom, not bad ones.  He should pay his workers fairly.  He should help farmers, traders, and everyone else.  If people are afraid, the king looks bad!"

"Rich people are important," Bhishma told Yudhishthira.  "They help the kingdom.  A king should be friends with them and work together to help everyone.  Being kind, honest, and fair is the best way to be a strong and happy king.  Be true, be kind, never get angry, and always protect your people. Then your kingdom will be strong and prosperous."
