The Pandavas, after hearing Krishna's advice, decided who would lead their army into battle.  Yudhishthira, the kindest brother, asked his brothers for their opinions.

Sahadeva thought King Virata, a strong and brave ally, would be a good leader. He was a powerful warrior who could fight even Bhishma, a very strong warrior for the Kauravas.

Nakula suggested Drupada, their father-in-law. He was wise, strong, and knew many battle strategies.  He was also friends with Drona, a powerful Kaurava teacher, so he might know how to fight him.

Arjuna, known as Savyasachi, chose Dhrishtadyumna.  Dhrishtadyumna was a very powerful warrior born from a sacred fire, and he was meant to defeat Drona. He was incredibly strong and brave.

Bhima chose Sikhandin. Sikhandin was destined to defeat the mighty Bhishma, and he was an unbeatable warrior on the battlefield.

Yudhishthira was unsure. He said, “Krishna knows best. Whoever Krishna chooses will lead our army.”

Krishna looked at Arjuna and said, "Your brothers have all named strong leaders.  Dhrishtadyumna is the right choice. He will defeat Drona!" Krishna then talked about how strong their army was – with Arjuna, Bhima, Abhimanyu and many other powerful warriors. They would surely win.


And so, Dhrishtadyumna was chosen to lead the Pandava army to victory.
