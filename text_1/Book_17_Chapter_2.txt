The five Pandava brothers – Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva – were on a long journey. They were very good at yoga, a kind of special exercise for the mind and body.

They traveled north, past a huge mountain called Himavat, and then across a big, sandy desert.  Finally, they saw Mount Meru, the tallest mountain of all!

As they walked,  Yudhishthira's sister-in-law, Draupadi (also called Krishna), suddenly fell to the ground!  Bhima, the strongest brother, asked Yudhishthira, "Why did Krishna fall? She's never done anything wrong!"

Yudhishthira said, "Krishna loved Arjuna more than the rest of us.  That's why she fell."

They kept walking.  Then, Sahadeva, the wisest brother, fell down too! Bhima asked Yudhishthira why.

Yudhishthira explained, "Sahadeva thought he was smarter than everyone else. That's his fault."

Next, Nakula, the most handsome brother, fell! Bhima was worried.  Yudhishthira said, "Nakula thought he was the most beautiful. That's why he fell."

Arjuna, the bravest brother, fell down next. Bhima was surprised because Arjuna was always truthful.  Yudhishthira said, "Arjuna boasted that he could defeat all their enemies in one day. He was too proud."

Finally, even Bhima fell! He asked Yudhishthira why. Yudhishthira said, "Bhima ate too much and never shared his food. He was too selfish."

Only Yudhishthira and their dog were left. They continued their journey.  Each brother fell because of a small fault, a little bit of pride or selfishness.  Their journey taught them a valuable lesson about humility.
