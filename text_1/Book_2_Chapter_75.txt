Bharata woke up.  He was sad and his eyes were watery. He saw his mother, Queen Kaushalya, looking very upset.  Bharata told his mother, "I never wanted to be king! I wasn't even there when the king decided Rama should be king.  I was far away with my brother Shatrughna. I didn't know about Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana being sent away."

Queen Kaushalya heard Bharata crying. She told another queen, Sumitra, "Bharata, Kaikeyi's son, is here. I want to see him."

Queen Kaushalya was very weak because she missed Rama so much. She walked shakily to Bharata. Bharata and Shatrughna went to see her. They saw how sad she was and started to cry too. Queen Kaushalya hugged Bharata and cried, "You didn't want to be king! But your cruel mother made you king. Why did she send my Rama to the forest?  I want to go to him! Or take me to him, Bharata!"

Bharata was very hurt by his mother's words. He felt like someone had poked a sore. He fell at her feet and cried. Then he calmed down and said, "Mother, you know I love Rama. I didn't do anything wrong!  I wish bad things would happen to the people who sent Rama away! I wish they would be poor, do bad things, and be very unhappy!"

Bharata wished many bad things on the people who made Rama leave. He wished they'd be poor, lonely, and sad. He wished for terrible things to happen to them.  He wished for them to be punished for what they had done.

Bharata was so sad that he wished terrible things on those who had sent Rama away.  He just wanted to comfort his mother.

Queen Kaushalya said, "My son, your words make me sadder, but it's good that you and Lakshmana love Rama so much.  You will be happy one day."

Queen Kaushalya held Bharata close and cried. Bharata cried too. He lay on the ground, very sad, all night long.
