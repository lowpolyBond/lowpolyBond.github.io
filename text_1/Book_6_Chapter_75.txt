Once upon a time, after a long night, the Pandavas and the Kauravas were ready for another big battle.  The noise was HUGE! Elephants trumpeted, soldiers shouted, horses neighed, and drums and horns made a deafening sound.

King Yudhishthira told his general, Dhrishtadyumna, "Let's fight in the Makara formation! It's like a scary sea monster that will defeat the enemy!"

Dhrishtadyumna made a plan.  The Makara formation looked like a monster! Drupada and Arjuna were its head. Nakula and Sahadeva were its eyes. Bhima was its sharp beak!  Others like Abhimanyu, Draupadi's sons, Ghatotkacha, Satyaki, and Yudhishthira formed its neck. King Virata was its back.  Other brave soldiers made up the rest of the monster.

King Dhritarashtra’s army, seeing this, formed their own army like a giant crane. Drona was in its beak. Aswatthaman and Kripa were its eyes. Many other brave warriors made up the rest of the crane.

Then the battle began!  The sun was shining. Elephants fought elephants. Horses fought horses. Soldiers fought soldiers.  It was a chaotic mess!  Everyone was angry and fighting hard.

The Pandavas, with Bhima and Arjuna, looked strong and brave.  The Kauravas, with Bhishma, Drona, Kripa, Salya, and Duryodhana, were also mighty warriors.

Bhima saw Drona and charged!  Drona, a great warrior, hit Bhima with many arrows.  Bhima was angry and killed Drona’s chariot driver. Drona fought back and hurt many Pandava soldiers.  So many soldiers were fighting, many ran away.

The battle was fierce and scary! Both armies fought bravely, throwing weapons at each other.  It was a terrible, but exciting sight to see!
