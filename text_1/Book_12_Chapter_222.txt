Once upon a time, a king named Yudhishthira was puzzled.  He asked his grandpa, Bhishma, "Grandpa, are we in charge of what happens to us, good or bad?  I'm confused!"

Bhishma smiled.  "Yudhishthira," he said, "let me tell you a story about Prahlada and Indra. Prahlada was a very good and wise prince. He wasn't bothered by anything in the world. He was happy no matter what."

Prahlada was a very wise prince.  He didn't get upset about bad things or too excited about good things. He saw everything as the same. One day, Indra, the king of the gods, visited him.  Prahlada was sad and poor at that time. But he wasn't upset!

Indra asked, "Prahlada, why aren't you sad? You've lost everything!"

Prahlada said, "Indra, good things and bad things happen because of nature. We don't really control them.  It's like a crow cawing – it just shows there's food, it doesn't *make* the food.  Our actions are like that crow. They show what nature is doing, but we don't make it happen."

He explained that everything is part of nature.  Good things, bad things, even being wise – it all comes from nature.  Prahlada didn’t worry about being good or bad, rich or poor, because it didn't matter in the end. He was at peace.

Indra was amazed! He asked, "How can I be at peace like you?"

Prahlada replied, "Be kind, be mindful, be pure, control your feelings, and learn from wise elders.  Peace comes from understanding nature."

Indra was very impressed with Prahlada’s wisdom.  He bowed and went home.  Bhishma finished the story, and Yudhishthira understood.  He realized that sometimes things just happen, and being at peace is more important than worrying about who is "in charge".
