Bharata went to his mother's room. He hadn't seen his father in the palace.  Kaikeyi, Bharata's mother, was so happy to see him! She hugged him tight.  Bharata noticed her room wasn't as fancy as usual.

"Mother," Bharata asked, "it's been seven days since I left Grandpa's house.  Are Grandpa and my uncle okay? Why is the king's room empty? Everyone looks sad. Where's my father?"

Kaikeyi knew what happened, but she didn't tell Bharata the whole truth right away.  She said softly, "My dear son, something sad has happened. Your father... he's passed away."

Bharata was heartbroken! He fell to the ground and cried. He said, "My father, who was like the moon in the sky, is gone!"

Kaikeyi hugged him and said, "My son, don't be so sad. Strong people don't give up."

Bharata kept crying. "Mother, why did Father die? Where are my brothers Rama and Lakshmana? I need to see Rama. He's like a father to me now."

Kaikeyi told him that his father's last words were about Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana. She explained that Rama had gone to the forest.

Bharata was shocked.  "Why did Rama go to the forest? Did he do something wrong?" he asked.

Kaikeyi then told Bharata the truth.  She had asked the king to send Rama away and make Bharata king instead. The king, very upset, died soon after.  "My son," she said, "the kingdom needs you now. Be king!"

Bharata was very upset, but he knew he had to be brave. He decided he needed to see Rama first.
