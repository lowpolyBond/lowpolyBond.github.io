Long ago, a wise man named Manu taught people about being happy.  He said that when we're sad, it's hard to be peaceful inside.  Don't think about sad things too much!  If you're sad because of something that happened to your body, see a doctor. If you're sad because of something that happened in your heart, be smart and think good thoughts. Don't act like a baby when you're sad.

Manu said we shouldn’t wish for things that don’t last, like being young forever, or having lots of money.  Those things disappear.  If everyone in your town is sad, don't be sad all by yourself. Look for ways to help!  Sadness is bigger than happiness, but we can choose to be happy. If you only think about fun things, you might forget about important things, and then you'll feel sad when things don't last.  The best way to be happy is to not be too happy or too sad.

Manu said that the world is full of things we want, but those things often cause sadness.  If you lose something, don't be too upset.  

He explained that true happiness, like a bright light, is inside us. It's like a quiet, peaceful feeling.  Our minds are like little boats, sometimes sailing near the shore, looking at things and getting busy,  sometimes sailing out to the calm, still water far away from shore, finding that quiet peaceful place. The more we think about what we see, the harder it is to find that peaceful place.  

To find this inner peace, we have to quiet our busy minds.  It's like closing the doors on all our senses—our eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin. When our minds are calm, we can feel that peaceful light inside.  It's like touching a special stone that turns everything into gold.

Manu said that good things come from doing good things, and bad things come from doing bad things. If you're attached to things, you'll be born again. But if you let go of things that don't last, you'll find true happiness.
