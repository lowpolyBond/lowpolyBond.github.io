Once upon a time, there was a great king named Janamejaya. He was performing a big fire sacrifice to kill all the snakes!  A wise young boy named Astika wanted to save the snakes.

King Janamejaya was about to give Astika a wish.  Suddenly, a big snake named Takshaka was thrown high in the air by a god.  He didn't fall into the fire! Everyone was surprised.

“Why didn't Takshaka fall?” someone asked.

Astika had secretly whispered three times, "Stay! Stay! Stay!" to the scared snake. That’s why Takshaka stayed floating in the air!

The king finally decided to end the sacrifice. Astika got his wish!  Everyone was happy. The king gave lots of presents to everyone who helped. He even gave lots of gifts to the person who had predicted that a wise person would stop the sacrifice.

The king was very grateful to Astika.  He invited Astika to a future big party! Astika went home to his family, very happy.  He told them all about what happened.

The saved snakes were so happy!  They wanted to thank Astika. They asked, "What can we do for you?"

Astika said, "If people read this story and remember me, they will be safe from snakes!"

The snakes agreed.  They promised that anyone who remembered Astika would be safe from snake bites.  They even said that a snake who bit someone who remembered Astika would get its hood split into a hundred pieces!

Astika lived a long and happy life, and when he died, he went to heaven.  

The story of Astika is very special.  If you remember this story, you won't be afraid of snakes!  That’s what the story tells us.
