Once upon a time, in a faraway kingdom, two princes, Rama and Bharata, were very good and kind.  Wise people were amazed by them! They said, "The king is lucky to have such wonderful sons!"

Some wise men wanted King Ravana's bad rule to end. They talked to Bharata.  They said, "Bharata, you are a prince!  Don't ignore Rama.  If you want your father, who's in heaven, to be happy, let Rama be king.  That way, your father won't have any problems in heaven."

The wise men went home. Rama was happy. He said, "You helped me do what is right!"

Bharata, worried, asked Rama, "Rama, you're older and better at ruling. You should be king! Our people need you, like farmers need rain.  Please, be king!"  Bharata bowed down to Rama.  He cried, "Rama! Rama!"

Rama hugged Bharata. He said, "Your kindness will make you a good ruler. Ask your friends and helpers for advice.  But I promised my father something, and I will keep that promise. I won't change my mind!"

Bharata said, "Rama, take these gold sandals. They will represent you while you're gone."  Rama took the sandals, then gave them back.

Bharata said, "I'll live simply for fourteen years, waiting for you. If you don't come back, I will end my life." Rama said, "Okay."  He told Bharata, "Take care of Mother Kaikeyi.  Don't be angry with her."

Rama hugged Bharata and his other brother, Shatrughna, goodbye. He was very sad.  Bharata put the sandals on a big elephant. Rama said goodbye to everyone. His moms cried too much to say anything.  Then, Rama went home, feeling very sad.
