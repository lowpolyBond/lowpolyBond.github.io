King Dhritarashtra was watching the great battle.  He asked Sanjaya, "The Pandavas and their friends were losing!  Drona, the great warrior, was like a strong tiger or a huge elephant – nobody dared to fight him! Who *did* try to fight Drona?"

Sanjaya said, "Drona was winning! He was shooting arrows like rain, pushing the Pandavas, the Matsyas, and the Panchalas back. The Kauravas were cheering!  King Duryodhana laughed and told Karna, ‘Look!  Drona has scared the Panchalas away like a lion scaring deer! They won't come back!’"

Duryodhana thought the battle was won. But Karna wasn't so sure.  He said, "Drona is strong, but the Pandavas are brave! They remember how Duryodhana tricked them, and they won't give up. Look! Bhima is coming back with other warriors – they’re going to attack Drona!"  Karna worried that Drona might be hurt.

Sanjaya explained, "Karna was right.  Hearing Karna, Duryodhana and his brothers rushed to help Drona. The Pandavas were coming back to fight, shouting and ready for battle!"
