Once upon a time, a wise man named Yayati met Ashtaka in a beautiful garden.  Ashtaka was amazed that Yayati, who could change into any shape he wanted, had left the magical Nandana gardens.

"Why did you leave?" Ashtaka asked.

Yayati explained, "In the afterlife, good people are happy, but bad people lose their friends, even the gods!  If you aren't good, you're all alone."

Ashtaka was curious about the afterlife. "How do people lose their goodness?" he asked.

Yayati said, "Boasting about how good you are is very bad!  People who do that end up in a scary place called Bhauma. It’s like being trapped, stuck on Earth, and even your family and friends will ignore you!"

Ashtaka was puzzled. "What happens to our bodies after we die?"

Yayati explained, "After we die, our bodies become food for animals. But our spirit doesn't disappear! It goes back into our mother's womb and is reborn.  That's Bhauma – being reborn again and again because you didn't do good things."

Ashtaka had more questions.  "What happens if you go to heaven and then do bad things?"

Yayati said, "If you do bad things, even in heaven, you fall back to Earth and are attacked by mean spirits. They are like your family – but they are trying to stop you from doing good."

"How does that happen?" asked Ashtaka.

Yayati explained, "Our spirit becomes very tiny and lives in water. This water helps make babies! So we can be reborn as animals or people, all depending on what we did before."

Ashtaka was still confused. "How do we get a new body?"

Yayati said, "It’s like a seed growing into a plant. Our spirit goes into a mother's womb, and slowly grows into a baby. We get eyes to see, ears to hear, and a mind to think."

Ashtaka asked, "But if our body is gone, how do we come back?"

Yayati said, "Even after death, our spirit remembers everything! It quickly finds a new body, good or bad, depending on how we lived."

Ashtaka wanted to know how to go to a happy place in the afterlife, a place where you never have to come back to Earth.

Yayati explained, "There are seven ways to get to heaven: being kind, calm, and controlled; being humble and simple; and being good to everyone. But pride is very bad.  Being boastful stops you from going to heaven.  True goodness is quiet and humble. The best thing is to be good for goodness' sake, not to show off!"
