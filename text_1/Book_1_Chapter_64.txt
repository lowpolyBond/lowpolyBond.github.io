Once upon a time, a king named Janamejaya wanted to know about all the great warriors who ever lived.  He asked a wise man, Vaisampayana, to tell him everything.

Vaisampayana said, "This is a big secret, even the gods don't know everything! But I'll try."

A long time ago, a powerful warrior named Parasurama got rid of all the warrior kings.  This left the land without kings! The women who wanted children asked wise priests for help. The priests helped them, and many new warrior babies were born.  Slowly, the land had warrior kings again.  Everyone lived peacefully.  People were kind and honest.  Animals and plants were healthy.  It was a wonderful time!

But then, bad people called Asuras started to be born.  They were mean and strong. They bullied everyone â€“ the good kings, the priests, farmers, and even the animals!  They were very bad and mean.

The Earth felt sad because of the mean Asuras. She was scared and went to see the great god Brahma, the creator of everything.  She asked for help. Brahma knew what to do.

Brahma told all the gods, "Go to Earth and become warriors! Fight the Asuras!"  He also told the beautiful singing creatures, the Gandharvas and Apsaras,  "Go to Earth and be born as people too!"

The gods went to see the greatest god of all, Lord Vishnu, and asked him to help.  Indra, the king of the gods, said, "Please come to Earth and help us!" Lord Vishnu agreed. He would become a warrior to fight the bad guys!  And so the great battle was about to begin!
