King Dasharatha's Charioteer, Sumantra, returned from taking Rama to the forest.  His horses were tired and sad.  Sumantra stayed with a friend for a few days, hoping Rama would call him back.

When he went home, everything was sad.  The trees looked sick.  The flowers were wilting.  The water was drying up.  Even the animals were quiet.  The forest was very, very still.  It was heartbroken because Rama was gone.

In the city of Ayodhya, everyone was unhappy.  When people saw Sumantra's chariot without Rama, they cried.  Women looked sadly from their windows. Everyone missed Rama very much.  The city felt as sad as Queen Kaushalya, Rama's mother.

King Dasharatha was very upset. He said, "Sumantra, I made a big mistake! I sent Rama away because I listened to a bad person. This is a terrible thing!  Please, take me to Rama! I must see him one more time before I die!"  He was so sad, he described how his heart felt like a big, stormy ocean.  The loss of Rama felt like a huge, deep sea.  His tears were like the swirling water.  He felt like he was drowning in his sadness.

The king was so sad that he fainted!  His wife, Queen Kaushalya, was very scared when she heard him.
