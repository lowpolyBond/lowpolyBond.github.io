Prince Rama rode in his chariot.  He smiled at his friends. The city was beautiful!  It was as white as a cloud.  Flags and banners flew everywhere.  Sweet smells of flowers and incense filled the air.  Lots and lots of people were there.  Big, beautiful buildings lined the streets.

He drove past shops filled with amazing things!  There was sandalwood, soft wool, shiny silks, sparkly pearls, and tons of jewels.  There was yummy food and drink, too! The streets were decorated with curds, rice, flowers, and milkâ€”it looked like a party!  Everyone cheered for him.  Older people said, "Prince Rama, rule like your grandpa and great-grandpa! We want to be happy like we were in their time.  We're so excited for you to become king!"

Rama rode on, happy and calm. Everyone wanted to see him.  If you didn't see him, people felt sorry for you! Rama was kind to everyone, rich or poor, young or old.  Everyone loved him.

Rama went past pretty temples and gardens. He bowed to them respectfully. Then, he saw the palace! It was HUGE!  It was as white as a cloud, with towers that looked like snowy mountains.  It sparkled with jewels. It was the most beautiful palace ever!

Rama got out of his chariot. He walked through three big gates guarded by strong archers.  He went through more gates, leaving his friends behind. Finally, he went inside to see his father.

Everyone waited outside. They were so excited!  They waited for Rama to come out, just like the ocean waits for the full moon.
