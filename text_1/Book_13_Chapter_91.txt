Long ago, in a time when only a few families lived, King Yudhishthira asked his grandpa, Bhishma, about Sraddha.  Sraddha was a special ceremony to remember people who had died.

Bhishma explained that a very long time ago, a wise man named Nimi's son died.  Nimi was very sad.  One day, feeling very lonely, he put out some yummy food on the moon's fourteenth day. He hoped it would reach his son.

The next morning, Nimi felt even sadder.  But then, he had a good idea! He thought he would make a special ceremony, a Sraddha, to honor his son.  He invited some priests and gave them nice food, without salt.

Nimi felt a little worried.  He had never seen a Sraddha like this before!  He wondered if it was right.  Then, his great-great-great-grandpa, Atri, appeared!

Atri told Nimi not to worry.  This Sraddha was a good thing!  It was a gift from the gods!  Atri explained how to do it properly.

Atri said you should offer special food, but not certain things.  No Kodrava or Pulka rice! No smelly onions or garlic!  And definitely no food with spit or tears on it!  Also, some foods were not good to eat during Sraddha, like certain meats and plants.  

Atri also said that only nice people should be there for the Sraddha, not mean people or people who had done bad things.

Atri explained that Sraddha is a way to make the spirits of those who passed away happy. After this, Atri went back to the gods. Nimi learned the rules and made sure the Sraddha was done correctly from then on. And that's the story of how Sraddha began!
