Prince Bharata's army was HUGE!  It marched through a forest.  Scared animals ran away!  Elephants trumpeted, bears grumbled, and leopards scrambled up trees.  The army was so big, it looked like a giant ocean of soldiers!

Bharata rode with his soldiers.  He was happy.  They walked and walked.  Then Bharataâ€™s horses and elephants got tired.

Bharata looked around. "This is Cittrakuta mountain!" he exclaimed to his wise teacher, Vasishtha. "And that's the Mandakini River!  This forest is just like the one Sage Bharadvaja described!"

He pointed to the elephants. "Look! They're like rain clouds showering flowers as they walk!"  He showed his brother Shatrughna the beautiful deer.  "They're like pretty clouds in the winter sky!"

Bharata said, "Our soldiers look like the people of the South, wearing flower crowns.  This scary forest now feels like home! The dust from the army is like the things hiding Rama from me.  It's blowing away!"  He pointed to peacocks running away. "Look at those beautiful peacocks! This place is perfect for holy people."

"Look at the deer," he continued, "They look like they are covered in flowers! Let's find Rama and Lakshmana!"

The soldiers went into the forest. They saw smoke rising in the distance.  They hurried back to Bharata.  "Prince!" they cried.  "There's smoke!  Rama and Lakshmana must be there, or maybe someone who knows where they are!"

Bharata smiled. "You all stay here," he told his army.  "Vasishtha and Sumantra will come with me."

Bharata, his teacher, and Sumantra went towards the smoke. The soldiers waited, excited to meet Rama!
