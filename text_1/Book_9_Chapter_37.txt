Baladeva, a strong and brave prince, traveled to a place called Vinasana.  The Saraswati River was gone there!  It had disappeared because it didn't like some people. That's why they called the place Vinasana, which means "disappearance."

After a bath in the river, Baladeva went to Subhumika.  Beautiful fairies, called Apsaras, played there!  Gods and Gandharvas (magical beings) visited too.  It was a very happy place, full of pretty flowers and lovely scents.  It was so beautiful they called it Subhumika, which means "very beautiful."

Baladeva gave lots of gifts to wise people called Brahmins, then he heard beautiful music! He saw shadows of gods, magical beings, and even some scary Rakshasas (demons).

Next, he went to a place where Gandharvas lived.  He gave them even more gifts â€“ goats, sheep, cows, and gold! He traveled to Gargasrota next, a place where a very wise man named Garga learned all about time and the stars. Baladeva gave gifts here, too.

He then went to Sankha, where he saw a HUGE tree, as tall as a mountain!  Many magical creatures lived there.  Baladeva gave more gifts, this time cows and pots. Then he visited Dwaita lake, where many different kinds of people lived. He gave them gifts as well.

He went to Nagadhanwana, a place full of snakes!  Even though it had 14,000 wise people and was the home of Vasuki, the king of the snakes, he was not afraid. He gave gifts to everyone he met.

Baladeva traveled to many more special places, giving gifts and praying along the way.  He finally saw something amazing: The Saraswati River had changed its path! It had curved to the east.

Janamejaya asked why the river changed course.  Vaishampayana explained that many, many wise people had come to Naimisha forest for a big twelve-year-long prayer.  So many came that there wasn't enough room on the riverbank for everyone!  The kind river changed its course to give them more space to pray.  Baladeva was amazed by this, and he was happy to see how kind the river was to these wise people.  Then, he went to the Sapta-Saraswat, another special place with lots of trees and animals, where he visited one more wise man.
