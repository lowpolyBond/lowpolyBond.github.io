Arjuna and his army were ready for battle.  The Samsaptakas, a group of brave warriors, lined up on the field. They looked like a giant half-moon!  They were so happy to see Arjuna that they shouted and cheered.  The shouts were so loud, they filled the whole sky!

Arjuna smiled a little. He whispered to his friend Krishna, "Look, those Samsaptakas are so happy, but they should be scared!  They think they'll go to a wonderful place after the battle, but only brave warriors go there."

Arjuna blew his special conch shell, Devadatta.  The sound was so loud and scary, it made the Samsaptakas freeze! Their horses and elephants were scared too. They even peed and threw up!

After a moment, the Samsaptakas got over their surprise. They shot hundreds of arrows at Arjuna!  But Arjuna was super-fast. He used just a few arrows to stop all their arrows. Then they shot more arrows at Arjuna, and he shot back. It was a big arrow fight!

Arjuna was so skilled. He even shot thirty arrows into the special hat on his head. His hat was so shiny, it looked like a golden crown!

Arjuna was very strong. He cut down a warrior's shield.  He knocked other warriors off their chariots.  He even cut off one warrior's head!  When that warrior fell, the rest of the Samsaptakas got scared and ran away!

But then their king shouted, "Don't be cowards! We can't run away! We must fight!"

The Samsaptakas blew their conch shells and charged back into battle, ready to fight even harder.  They were determined to fight bravely, even to the very end!
