Once upon a time, a wise king named Yudhishthira asked his grandfather, Bhishma, a very, very old and wise man, some big questions.  He wanted to know about the magic of knowledge and doing good things.

Bhishma said, "Let me tell you a story.  Long ago, a great teacher named Vrihaspati asked his own teacher, Manu, some important questions. Vrihaspati said, 'Teacher, what is the reason for everything in the world?  What makes good deeds work? What happens when you are really, really smart? What is the biggest mystery that even the holy books can't explain? Where does everything come from – the earth, the sky, the water, even the animals?'

Manu, the wise teacher, explained,  "Happiness is what you like, and sadness is what you don't like.  People do good deeds to be happy and avoid sadness. But the smartest people try to learn so much that they don't need to worry about happiness or sadness.  The holy books about good deeds are all about wanting things.  But if you don't want anything, you become one with the greatest power of all."

Vrihaspati still had questions. He said, "People want good things and don't want bad things. They do things to get what they want."

Manu said, "To become one with the greatest power, you have to stop wanting things.  Good deeds are a way to get ready, but only if you want to be happy and free. Good deeds are like seeds. The best deeds bring good things now and things that last forever. To get the forever things, you have to stop caring about getting anything.  It’s like when the sun comes up, and you can finally see.  When you’re really smart, you see all the bad things to avoid, just like you see a snake on the path and step around it.  There are five special good deeds: saying the right words, doing the right rituals, giving gifts, sharing food, and thinking good thoughts.  These deeds have different powers and sometimes make you happy or sad.

You enjoy the good things you do with your body, your words, or your thoughts. Your body is where you feel happy or sad.

But the greatest wisdom is better than all that.  It brings happiness now, even before you die. There's something bigger than all this, something that made everything. It can’t be seen or felt.  It's beyond words. It's beyond male or female. It's just… *there*."


And that's the story Bhishma told Yudhishthira about the magic of knowledge and good deeds.
