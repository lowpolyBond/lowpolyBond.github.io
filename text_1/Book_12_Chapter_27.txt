Yudhishthira was very, very sad.  Many good people died in the big war. His grandfather, his uncles, cousins, and even Abhimanyu, a young boy, were all gone.  He felt terrible. He said, "I wanted to be king so badly, I killed my own family! I killed my grandfather!  He was like a lion, strong and brave, but he was hurt so badly by arrows. I watched him fall, and my heart broke.  I also caused the death of my teacher, Drona. I tricked him. I told him his son was dead, but it wasn't true. I lied to him. I also killed my brother Karna, a great warrior."

Yudhishthira felt so guilty he wanted to die. He said, "I'm a terrible person.  I want to starve myself until I'm gone."

But then, the wise Vyasa came. Vyasa said, "Yudhishthira, don’t be so sad.  Everything that happens is part of a bigger plan.  Everything is born, and everything dies, like bubbles in the water.  Being sad won’t bring them back.  You should work hard and be a good king." Vyasa explained that even though Yudhishthira had made mistakes, life was about work and doing good things.  Being a good king was part of Yudhishthira's destiny, even if it was a hard job.  He shouldn't give up.
