Once upon a time, two wise men, Bharadwaja and Bhrigu, talked about how our bodies work.  Bharadwaja wondered, "How does the body's heat stay inside? And how does the air inside us make us move?"

Bhrigu explained, "Imagine the air inside you as a special kind of wind, called *Prana*. It's like a tiny superhero living in your head! This Prana, along with the warmth in your head, helps you move and do things.  Prana is also your life force, your mind, and your thoughts. It's what makes you, YOU!"

"But there are other air helpers!" Bhrigu continued. " *Samana* helps your senses work, like seeing and hearing. *Apana* helps you go to the bathroom. And *Udana* and *Vyana* help all the other parts of your body work together."

"Your body also has heat," Bhrigu said.  "It's like a tiny fire, spread all over by Samana. This heat helps digest your food.  Imagine a tube running from your mouth to your tummy.  Lots of tiny tubes branch out from it. The air helpers flow through these tubes, mixing together and helping your body work."

"The heat in your body, especially in your tummy, helps digest your food," Bhrigu explained.  "It all works together, like a team! Your tummy is where the food gets digested. The air helpers move the food around, and the heat helps it break down. Your belly button is like the control center of this amazing process."

"Even yogis – super strong and peaceful people – understand these air helpers," Bhrigu said. "By focusing on the air inside their heads, they can learn to control their bodies and minds."

"So," Bhrigu concluded, "your body has this wonderful team of air helpers and a tiny fire inside. They work together to keep you healthy and strong!"
