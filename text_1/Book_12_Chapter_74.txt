Once upon a time, there was a very strong king named Muchukunda. He was so strong he conquered the whole world!  He wanted to test his power, so he went to see Vaisravana, the king of the magical city of Alaka.

Vaisravana, who had magical powers, created a huge army of scary Rakshasas (monsters!).  They fought Muchukunda's army, and many soldiers died.

Muchukunda was upset. He blamed his wise priest, Vasishtha. Vasishtha, a very good and holy man, performed special prayers.  He defeated the Rakshasas!

Vaisravana appeared and said, "Many great kings have come to me for help.  They worshipped me. You're strong, but why are you relying on your priest’s magic instead of your own strength?"

Muchukunda answered, "The gods made Brahmanas (priests) wise and strong with magic, and Kshatriyas (kings and warriors) strong with weapons. We need each other to rule the world. I'm ruling well, using both our strengths!"

Vaisravana said, "I don’t give or take kingdoms unless the gods tell me to.  You can rule the whole world!"

Muchukunda said, "No thank you! I want to rule because I won, not because you gave it to me!"

Vaisravana was amazed by Muchukunda’s bravery. He was a true warrior king. Muchukunda continued to rule the earth, using his own strength and the wisdom of his priest.

Bhishma, the wise old man telling this story, said that a king who works well with his priest and is always brave, will rule well and become very famous.  The priest should always pray, and the king should always be ready to fight to protect his people.  Together, they can rule the world fairly!
