Once upon a time, a king named Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, about the best gifts to give.  Bhishma told him a story.

Long ago, in a town near the rivers Ganga and Yamuna, lived many wise Brahmins (priests).  The king of the dead, Yama, wanted to meet a special Brahmin named Sarmin.  He sent a scary messenger, but the messenger made a mistake! He brought the wrong Brahmin.

Yama was very surprised. He was so kind, he bowed to the wrong Brahmin and sent him home! Then, he sent the messenger to get the right Brahmin, Sarmin.

Yama asked the first Brahmin, "What good deeds bring the greatest happiness?"

The Brahmin asked Yama to tell him.  Yama explained, "Giving sesame seeds is wonderful!  Giving them every day brings good luck.  Giving water is also very good. Dig wells and ponds so people always have water to drink.  Lighting lamps in dark places also helps."

Yama sent the Brahmin home. He then met Sarmin and told him the same things â€“ about giving sesame seeds, water, and lighting lamps. Both Brahmins did as Yama said.

Bhishma continued, "Yama also said that giving shiny jewels is a very good thing.  Giving clothes is also great! It makes you look good and feel good. And having a family and children is the best of all!"

So, Yudhishthira learned that giving gifts like sesame seeds, water, lamps, jewels, and clothes were all very good things to do!  And having a family is the best gift of all.
