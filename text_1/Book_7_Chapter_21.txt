Once upon a time, during a great war, a powerful warrior named Drona wanted to capture Yudhishthira, the kind king.  Drona shot many arrows at Yudhishthira!  The other soldiers shouted loudly, like elephants getting scared of a big lion.

A brave prince named Satyajit jumped in to help. He and Drona fought a super battle!  Satyajit threw lots of arrows.  He even hit Drona's chariot driver and horses!  Then, he went around in circles, super fast! He even chopped off Drona's flag!

Drona got really angry. He broke Satyajit's bow with an arrow!  Then he shot many arrows at Satyajit.  But Satyajit got a new bow and shot back!  The Pandava army cheered!  Another warrior, Vrika, also helped, shooting many arrows at Drona.

Drona was strong! He broke Vrika's and Satyajit's bows, and defeated them.  Then he cut off Satyajit's head!  Yudhishthira was scared and ran away on his fast chariot.

Other soldiers tried to save Yudhishthira, but Drona was like a fire, burning everything in his path! A brave warrior named Satanika fought Drona, but Drona cut off Satanika's head too!  The Matsya soldiers ran away.

Drona was unstoppable! He defeated many armies â€“ the Chedis, Karushas, Kaikeyas, Panchalas, and Srinjayas. He shot arrows like a giant storm, hitting elephants, horses, and soldiers. His golden chariot shone brightly. Drona caused a huge mess of a battle; a river of blood, broken weapons, and dead bodies!

Many more Pandava soldiers tried to stop Drona.  Sikhandin, Kshatradharman, Vasudeva, Uttamaujas, Kshatradeva, Satyaki, Yudhamanyu, Yudhishthira, Dhrishtadyumna, and Chekitana all shot arrows at Drona. But Drona was too strong! He killed many of them, including Kshema.  Then he chased Yudhishthira again!

Yudhishthira ran away again.  A Panchala prince tried to fight Drona but Drona defeated him too.  He killed many soldiers from the Panchala, Matsya, Kaikeya, Srinjaya, and Pandava armies!  Drona and the Kaurava army won that part of the battle.  The other soldiers were very scared.
