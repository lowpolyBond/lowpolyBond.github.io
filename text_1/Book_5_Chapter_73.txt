A wise holy man spoke to Yudhishthira, the king.  "I know what's in your heart, and I know what's in Duryodhana's heart. You want what's right. He wants to fight and be mean!  You'd rather not fight, but that’s not always possible for a king.  Kings don't beg for things; they fight for them! A warrior king like you must fight or die bravely in battle.  Being a coward isn't good. You can't just sit around and be scared.

Duryodhana is very powerful. He has many friends and strong warriors like Bhishma and Drona fighting with him. He’ll never give you your kingdom back peacefully.  He's been mean to you all along! Remember the game of dice?  He cheated! He even made you and your brothers live in the forest! He even insulted Draupadi, your wife, in front of everyone!  He and his brothers laughed and said horrible things about you. They said you were nothing, that you lost everything.  Dussasana, his brother, even pulled Draupadi's hair!  Even though you and your brothers were strong, you couldn't fight back because you were good.

Everyone saw how mean Duryodhana was.  Even the wise people were sad.  They knew Duryodhana was bad.  For a good person, being ashamed is terrible.  It’s even worse than dying.  But Duryodhana didn't even feel bad!  He's like a weak tree – easy to destroy.

He deserves to be punished. You must fight him. Don't be scared! I will go and talk to everyone. I will show them how good you are and how bad Duryodhana is.  I will ask for peace, but I think a war is coming.  I see bad signs.  The birds are screaming, the animals are howling, and even the fire looks scary!  Get ready for war!  Gather your army, your elephants, your horses, and your chariots.  Duryodhana will never give you back your kingdom while he's still alive! You must fight to get it back!"
