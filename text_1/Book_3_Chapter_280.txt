Once upon a time, Rama and his brother Lakshmana lived on a mountain.  One night, Rama missed his wife, Sita, who was taken away by the mean king Ravana.  He felt very sad.

The next morning, Rama told Lakshmana, "Go to Sugriva, the monkey king.  I helped him become king, but he seems to have forgotten me!  If he's just having fun and not helping us find Sita, tell him to hurry up! If he is helping, bring him back here."

Lakshmana went to Sugriva's city. Sugriva and his wife were happy to see him. Lakshmana told Sugriva about Rama's worries.

Sugriva said, "I'm not ungrateful, Lakshmana! I sent many monkeys to look for Sita.  They promised to be back in a month. It's almost time!"

Lakshmana went back to Rama.  Soon, many monkeys returned. They had searched everywhere but couldn't find Sita.  Rama was still sad.

After two more months, some monkeys came running. They said, "The best monkeys, Hanuman and Angada, are back! They're eating from a special garden that belonged to Vali!"  Sugriva knew this meant they had found Sita!

Rama saw Hanuman and knew he had good news. Hanuman said, "I found Sita, Rama! We searched everywhere.  We found a big cave, and inside, a palace. We met a nice lady who helped us. Then we saw the ocean!"

Hanuman continued, "We were sad and hungry.  We talked about Jatayu, a big bird who helped you before. Then, we saw Sampati, Jatayu's brother! He told us where Sita was: in Lanka, Ravana's city, across the ocean!"

Hanuman bravely jumped across the wide ocean. He found Sita in Ravana's palace.  She was sad and looked very different. Hanuman gave her a secret sign Rama would know.

Then, Hanuman caused a big fire in Lanka before he returned with the good news.  He had found Sita!
