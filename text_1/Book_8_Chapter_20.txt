King Dhritarashtra asked his advisor Sanjaya, "You told me about the great warrior Pandya.  Tell me more about his amazing battles!"

Sanjaya said, "King Dhritarashtra, you think Bhishma, Drona, Kripa, Karna, and Arjuna are the best warriors.  But Pandya thought *he* was the best! He didn't think anyone was as strong as him.  Not even Karna or Bhishma!

Pandya was furious! He was attacking Karna's army.  It was huge – lots of chariots, horses, and soldiers!  Pandya was like a strong wind, blowing away the army! His arrows flew everywhere, hitting chariots, horses, soldiers, and even elephants! He knocked down elephants and their riders. He broke their spears and banners.  He destroyed everything in his path!

He fought the Pulindas, the Khasas, the Bahlikas, and many other brave soldiers. He beat them all!  He took their weapons and armor, and defeated them.

Ashvatthama, Drona's son, saw Pandya fighting. Ashvatthama was a great warrior too! He said to Pandya, "You are a great warrior, like the mighty god Indra! Let's fight!"

Pandya said, "Okay!"

They fought! Ashvatthama shot many powerful arrows, but Pandya cut them all down with his own arrows. He even broke Ashvatthama’s chariot!  Then Ashvatthama got new horses and shot even MORE arrows.  Pandya cut them all down too!  He was amazing!

Then, Ashvatthama shot so many arrows that it looked like a huge storm! He destroyed Pandya’s chariot. Pandya saw a big, strong elephant. He quickly climbed onto it!

From the elephant, Pandya threw a spear and knocked off Ashvatthama’s crown!  Ashvatthama was very angry! He shot many more arrows. He cut the elephant into pieces. He also hit Pandya, sadly killing him.

Pandya’s brothers and King Yudhishthira were sad, but they went to Ashvatthama and bowed to him.  Even though they had fought hard, they respected his skill and bravery.  He was a truly great warrior."
