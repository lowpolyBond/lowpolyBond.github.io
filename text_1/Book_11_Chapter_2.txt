King Yudhishthira was very sad.  Many of his family had died in a big battle.  His wise uncle, Vidura, came to him.

"King," Vidura said kindly, "why are you so upset? Everyone dies someday.  Even strong things fall.  Everything that starts must end. People are together for a time, but then they separate.  Life ends with death. Death takes everyone, brave or not.  So, there's no shame in fighting a battle. If itâ€™s your time, you can't escape death."

"Think about it," Vidura continued. "Before we were born, we didn't exist. Then we lived for a while, and then we will not exist again.  So why be so sad? Worrying doesn't bring back the dead.  Even gods die. Death is like the wind blowing down all the grass.  It affects everyone equally. They were all brave warriors. They fought well, and they went to a good place. They weren't yours, and you weren't theirs.  Don't be sad."

"In battle, if you die, you go to heaven," Vidura explained. "If you win, you get fame.  It's a good thing to be brave and fight.  Warriors who die in battle go straight to heaven with Indra, the king of the gods! They don't have to do hard things or pray a lot.  They earned it through their courage."

Vidura helped the king understand that everyone faces sorrow and fear. It's normal. Wise people don't let sadness control them.  Time affects everyone equally, rich or poor, young or old.  Nothing stays the same. We lose friends, our beauty fades, and we grow older.  Don't hold onto sadness. It makes things worse.  If you have bad feelings, try not to think about them.  It's like a medicine to ignore sadness.

"Your actions decide your happiness and sadness," Vidura said. "Good things happen from good actions, and bad things from bad actions. You're a wise king. Don't let sadness control you. Be strong."
