Kumbhakarna, a giant, marched towards the monkey army. He wanted to find Rama.  He saw Lakshmana, Rama's brother, standing ready with his bow.

The monkeys jumped on Kumbhakarna! They hit him with big trees and scratched him with their sharp claws.  They threw all sorts of weapons at him.

Kumbhakarna just laughed! He was so strong, he ate some of the monkeys!  The other monkeys cried out in fear.

Sugriva, the monkey king, bravely attacked Kumbhakarna. He smashed a huge tree on Kumbhakarna's head, but it didn't even hurt him!

Kumbhakarna grabbed Sugriva!  Lakshmana, quick as a flash, shot a golden arrow. The arrow flew straight through Kumbhakarna, making him let go of Sugriva.

Angry, Kumbhakarna picked up a giant rock to throw at Lakshmana. But Lakshmana was too fast! He cut off Kumbhakarna's arms with his arrows.  But more arms grew back!  This happened again and again!

Finally, Lakshmana used a super-powerful magic arrow.  It was so strong that it made Kumbhakarna fall like a giant tree struck by lightning.

Kumbhakarnaâ€™s friends, the other giants, ran away scared.  But two of them, Vajravega and Promathin, came back to fight Lakshmana.

Lakshmana fought them bravely.  It was a super exciting battle!  Then Hanuman, a super strong monkey, picked up a huge mountain and smashed Vajravega.  Another strong monkey, Nala, crushed Promathin with a big rock.

The battle between Rama's army and Ravana's army continued.  Many monkeys and giants were hurt. But many more giants died than monkeys.
