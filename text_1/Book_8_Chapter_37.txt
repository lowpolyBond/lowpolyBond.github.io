The great battle was about to begin!  Sanjaya, a wise man, told the story.

The Kaurava army cheered loudly when Karna, a mighty warrior, got ready to fight.  Drums beat, cymbals clashed, and arrows flew. The whole army marched towards the enemy, ready for anything.  The ground shook! The sun, moon, and stars seemed to fight each other in the sky!  Strange things happened – it rained bones, and the animals cried.  These were scary signs, but nobody cared.  The Kauravas were sure they would win!

Karna, remembering how Bhishma and Drona, two great heroes, had been killed, felt angry. He was proud and boastful.  "Even Indra, the king of the gods, wouldn't scare me!" he yelled to his charioteer, Shalya. "Bhishma and Drona were strong, but even they were killed.  Arjuna is the only one who could stop me!  But I'll defeat him, even if I have to die trying!" Karna was very confident. He talked about how strong he was, and how nobody else could fight Arjuna.  He said that even Drona, a very powerful warrior, couldn’t stop Arjuna.

Shalya, Karna's charioteer, wasn't impressed. He laughed at Karna and said, "Don't brag so much! You’re talking big!  Who are you compared to Arjuna?  Remember when Arjuna fought the gods and won? Remember when he saved the Kauravas?  Why didn’t you fight him then?" Shalya reminded Karna that Arjuna was much stronger.

Karna just got angrier.  "Fine, fine," he snapped, "Let's fight and see who wins!"

Shalya, even though he thought Karna was being foolish, simply said, "Okay."

Karna, in his shiny chariot pulled by white horses, charged into battle.  He was determined to find Arjuna and fight him, no matter what.  He roared into battle, like the sun burning away the darkness.
