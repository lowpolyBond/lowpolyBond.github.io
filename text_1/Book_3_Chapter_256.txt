After the battle, the Pandavas – Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva – lived in the forest.  One night, Yudhishthira had a strange dream.

He dreamt of sad deer.  Their eyes were full of tears. They were very scared.  They begged Yudhishthira for help.  They told him that the Pandavas, who were great hunters, had killed so many deer that only a few were left.  They asked Yudhishthira to move to a new home so they could be safe.

Yudhishthira felt very sorry for the deer. He was kind and didn't want to hurt any animals.  When he woke up, he told his brothers about his dream.

He said, "We've hunted here for a long time. We've killed many animals.  Let's move to the Kamyaka forest. It's a big, beautiful forest with lots of food for the animals, and there will be plenty of space for everyone!"

His brothers agreed.  So they packed up their things and moved to the Kamyaka forest with their friends and servants. They were happy to be in a new place where they could live peacefully, and where the animals would be safe.  The Kamyaka forest was a much better home for everyone.
