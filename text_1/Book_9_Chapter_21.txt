Sanjaya told the king, "After a brave warrior named Salwa died, your army ran away, just like a big tree falling in a storm!  But a strong warrior named Kritavarma stayed and fought.  He was so brave!

When the other soldiers saw Kritavarma fighting like a strong mountain, even though he was hurt, they got brave again and came back to fight!  A huge battle happened! Kritavarma was so amazing, he fought the Pandavas all by himself!

When friends fought bravely, they cheered so loud it sounded like roaring lions!  This made the Pancalas scared.  Then, another brave warrior, Satyaki, arrived. He quickly defeated King Kshemakirti!

Then, Kritavarma and Satyaki fought!  They were amazing archers. They shot arrows like angry lions! The other soldiers just watched their amazing fight. They shot so many arrows, it was like a shower of arrows!

Kritavarma shot arrows that hit Satyaki's horses. Satyaki got angry and shot Kritavarma.  Kritavarma then broke Satyaki's bow! But Satyaki quickly got a new bow and shot many arrows at Kritavarma's horses and chariot.  Kritavarma was furious! He threw a spear at Satyaki. But Satyaki quickly shot the spear to pieces! Then, he hit Kritavarma in the chest with an arrow. Kritavarma's chariot was broken and he fell to the ground!

Everyone was scared when Kritavarma fell! Kripa, another warrior, saved Kritavarma and took him away.  Now Duryodhana's army was running away again!  They were hiding in a cloud of dust!

Only Duryodhana, the king's son, stayed and fought.  He was brave and strong.  He fought all the Pandavas by himself like a giant fire! No one could get close to him.  Then, another warrior arrived to fight."
