Once upon a time, a wise man named Yajnavalkya was talking to a king.  He explained that everything in the world is made up of three things: goodness (Sattwa), passion (Rajas), and darkness (Tamas).  Think of them like different colors mixing together!

These three things are part of something called Prakriti, which is like the basic stuff the universe is made from.  There's also Purusha, which is like the spirit or energy that makes things happen. Purusha uses Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas to create all the different things we see.

Yajnavalkya said that if something is mostly goodness (Sattwa), it's like a god or lives in a beautiful place. If it's a mix of goodness and passion (Sattwa and Rajas), itâ€™s like a human. If it has mostly passion and darkness (Rajas and Tamas), it might be an animal. And if it's a mix of all three, it's also a human.  People who are very good and wise go to a special place that's always happy and peaceful.

The king, Janaka, was curious. He asked Yajnavalkya, "If Prakriti is just the stuff of the world, and Purusha is the energy, how can one be lifeless and the other alive?  How do they work together?"

Yajnavalkya explained that Purusha is like a driver, and Prakriti is like a car. The car can't go anywhere without a driver, and the driver needs a car to get around.  Prakriti can't create or destroy anything by itself; it needs Purusha.

King Janaka then asked Yajnavalkya to tell him more about where things go after they die, and about how to live a good life and become wise. Yajnavalkya promised to explain all about that. He knew all these things as well as he knew the palm of his hand!
