Once upon a time, in the land of Bharat, a good king named Yudhishthira asked his grandfather, Bhishma, a very wise man, a question.  "Grandpa," he said, "everyone keeps fasts, even people from faraway lands.  Why? I only heard that priests and kings should fast. How can other people get good things by fasting?  What happens to someone who fasts? How can fasting help someone get better, be good, and go to heaven?"

Bhishma smiled. "Yudhishthira, my dear boy, I asked the same question to a very holy man, Rishi Angiras, a long time ago."

Rishi Angiras explained: "Priests and kings can fast for one, two, or three nights.  But other people should only fast for one night.  Fasting too long isn't good for them.  Fasting is like a gift!

If you skip one meal on certain days of the moon, you'll be kind, beautiful, and clever. You won't be poor or lonely.  Fasting on other special days will make you strong and healthy.

Fasting for a whole month is even better! In the month of Margasirsha, if you skip one meal each day and share your food with priests, you'll be free from bad things and have lots of food.

Each month has its own special fasting benefits.  If you fast in Pausha, you'll be lucky and look great.  In Magha, you'll be born into a good family. In Bhagadaivata, people will like you very much!  Fasting in Chaitra brings riches, and in Vaisakha, you'll be admired by your family.  Jyaishtha brings wealth and honor, and Ashadha gives you lots of food and children.  In Sravana, everyone will respect you.  Proshthapada brings lots of money, Aswin makes you pure and gives you lots of animals, and Kartika gives you courage and many friends.

You can also fast on specific days of the moon.  If you fast and eat only rice every two weeks, you'll live a long life and have many cows and children.  Fasting for many years will make you the most important person among your friends and family.

If you eat only two meals a day, and are kind to everyone, you'll be as good as someone who has performed a big, important ceremony!  You'll live in a beautiful place filled with singing and dancing, and have lots of friends.

If you fast for a whole year, you'll earn even more good things, and your rewards will last a long time in heaven.  Different fasts bring different amounts of good things and different lengths of time in heaven.  But never fast for more than a month at a time.

Anyone who doesn’t have a sickness and fasts correctly will earn good things at every step. They'll ride on beautiful carriages and live a joyful life.  Even the gods fasted to get to heaven! Great wise people also fasted to become even wiser.

The best things are being good, honoring your mother, and fasting.  If you share what you know about fasting with others, you will always be happy.”

Yudhishthira thanked Bhishma. He now understood the power of fasting and kindness.
