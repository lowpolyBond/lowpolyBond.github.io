Once upon a time, Suka asked his father, Vyasa, a very wise man, a really important question.  Suka said, "There are rules in the holy books, some saying 'do this,' others saying 'don't do that'.  How can I know which rules are most important?"

Vyasa smiled.  "My son," he said, "there are two ways to live a good life.  One is living in the world, doing good deeds. The other is a life of quiet thinking and learning, understanding the world's secrets. The best way is to find a balance of both."

Vyasa explained that long ago, wise people lived simple lives. They lived in the forest, eating berries and roots. They were kind to everyone. They studied hard and meditated. By being good and learning, they became very wise.

Suka then said, "The rules in the holy books seem to disagree sometimes! How can they all be right?"

Bhishma, another very wise person, stepped in.  Vyasa answered, "There are four stages of life.  The first is being a student.  You live with your teacher and learn everything you can. You help them with chores.  You listen carefully. You always show them respect."

Vyasa described what a student should do:  "Always get up before your teacher, go to bed after them, eat after them, and never look at them with curious eyes. Always obey your teacher, asking questions politely."

"After being a student, you get married and have a family," Vyasa continued. "This is the second stage of life. You live a normal life with your family and still try to be good.

Later, after spending the first two stages of life in learning and family, one can live as a hermit in a forest, focusing on inner peace.  The last stage is as a wandering holy person, helping those in need."

Vyasa explained, "Each stage is like a step on a ladder. By following all four stages carefully, you will finally understand the greatest secrets of life."
