Long ago, in a land far away, lived wise men called Brahmins.  Bhishma, a very old and wise Brahmin, told a king about how Brahmins should live.

He said Brahmins shouldn't be warriors or farmers or shopkeepers.  They shouldn't work for the king or lend money for interest. They should study holy books and live simple lives.  If a Brahmin did bad things, he was like someone of a lower class.  He even said a Brahmin who married someone from a lower class or became a dancer, was no longer a true Brahmin.  If they did bad things, they were treated like someone from a lower class, even at feasts.  Giving gifts to bad Brahmins didn't bring good luck! Brahmins should be good and kind.

Bhishma then talked about other people.  He said everyone, even people from lower classes, should do their jobs well.  If they did, everyone would be happy, and even the gods would be pleased!

He said kings, who are warriors, are very important. They protect everyone.  The king's job is the most important, even more important than farmers or shopkeepers. The king's job is to keep everyone safe and make sure everyone follows the rules.  Without good kings, people wouldn’t follow the rules, and bad things would happen.  Everything depends on the king being good and strong!  If the king isn’t good, it is like everything else goes wrong. The whole world depends on the king doing a good job!
