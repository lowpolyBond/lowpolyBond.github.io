Once upon a time, after a big battle, Duryodhana, the prince of the Kauravas, was hiding in a lake.  He was sad and angry.  His father, King Dhritarashtra, was worried.  He asked his advisor, Sanjaya, "What happened to my son? How did he react to being scolded by the Pandavas?"

Sanjaya said, "The Pandavas, Yudhishthira and his brothers, were very angry with Duryodhana. They teased him because he was all alone, without his army or weapons. Duryodhana was very upset. He sighed deeply and said, 'I'm all alone! I have no chariot or soldiers! How can I fight them all?'"

Duryodhana was brave, though. He continued, "I don't fear anyone! I will fight all of you! I will avenge the death of my friends and family! I will fight like the sun destroys the stars!"

Yudhishthira replied kindly, "Duryodhana, you're a brave warrior. You can fight one of us, using any weapon you choose. If you win, you become king! If you lose, you'll go to heaven."

Duryodhana chose a mace (a heavy club). He said, "Let's have a mace fight!  I will defeat you all!"

Yudhishthira agreed. He said, "Okay, Duryodhana, fight me!  Be brave, show your strength!"

Duryodhana was so angry at being teased, he couldn't stand it.  He stormed out of the lake! He was covered in blood and water, looking fierce and powerful. He looked like a strong, angry elephant!

He yelled, "Pandavas, you will pay for this! I will defeat you all!"

He then put on his golden armor and helmet. He looked like the sun, shining brightly. He shouted, "Choose one of you to fight me with your mace! I will defeat you all!"  And so, the great mace fight began.
