Once upon a time, there was a kind king named Pandu.  His wife, Kunti, was very beautiful. Pandu told Kunti that in the olden days, women were free to do as they pleased.  They didn't always stay with just one husband.  It was different then!

But Pandu explained that a long time ago, a wise man named Swetaketu changed things.  One day, a man took Swetaketu's mother away. Swetaketu got very angry! His father, a very wise Rishi (a holy man), explained that this was the old way.  But Swetaketu didn't like it. He decided that women should only be with one husband.  This became the new rule for people, but not for animals.

Pandu said that because of Swetaketu, it was now wrong for women to have more than one husband.  He also said that if a wife didn't have children when her husband wanted her to, it was wrong.

Pandu couldn't have children himself. He asked Kunti to have children for him, using a special magic spell.  Kunti knew this spell. A wise man named Durvasa had given it to her a long time ago.  The spell let her ask a god for a child.

Pandu told Kunti to ask Dharma, the god of justice, for a child. He said that a child from Dharma would be very good and pure.  Kunti agreed to do as her husband asked. She bowed down to him and promised to follow his wishes.
