Arjuna, the brave warrior, wanted to fight Karna. He was happy to make King Yudhishthira proud.  He asked his friend Krishna to get his chariot ready.  "Make it fast!" he said. "I need my best horses and all my weapons!"

Krishna told Daruka to do it quickly. Daruka, the chariot driver, got Arjuna’s chariot ready. It was covered in tiger skins and was super fast.  Arjuna got Yudhishthira’s blessing and then climbed into the chariot. Everyone knew Karna was in big trouble.  The air felt peaceful.  Even the birds seemed to cheer for Arjuna!  Lucky birds flew around him. Scary birds like vultures waited for the battle to begin.

Arjuna was worried. He was sweating.  Krishna saw Arjuna was nervous.  He said, "Arjuna, you are the greatest warrior ever! You've beaten Drona, Bhishma, and so many others! You have amazing weapons and skills.  Nobody is as good as you!"

But Krishna said, "Arjuna, Karna is very strong too. He's as strong as fire, as fast as the wind, and as angry as a storm! He is big and brave. He’s a really tough opponent.  You need to be extra careful and fight with all your might."

Krishna explained that Karna was proud and fought for the wrong side. He was always mean to the Pandavas.  "Only you, Arjuna, can defeat Karna.  You must defeat him today!" Krishna urged.  "Show the world your strength, and avenge the wrongs Karna has done!"  He told Arjuna to fight like a lion fighting an elephant – strong and brave.
