Once upon a time, the wise king Yudhishthira asked his grandfather Bhishma, "Grandfather, everyone talks about doing good things. But what's the BEST thing we can do to be good?"

Bhishma smiled. "My dear Yudhishthira," he said, "the best way to be good is to do really hard things to show how dedicated you are.  The very best thing is to go without food!"

Bhishma then told a story about a great king named Bhagiratha.  Bhagiratha was so good, he went to a magical place that even gods couldn't reach!  The great Brahman, the creator of the world, asked him, "How did you get here?"

Bhagiratha said, "I did many good things. I gave away lots and lots of gold, performed many ceremonies, and gave away many cows, horses, elephants, and even whole villages! I even lived near a sacred river for many years, doing hard things to show my goodness."

But then Bhagiratha said something amazing. He said, "None of those things got me here!  It was something even better:  I went without food!"

Bhishma explained, "Bhagiratha fasted â€“ he didn't eat for a very long time to show his commitment. That's why he got to that magical place. It's the most powerful way to be good."

Bhishma told Yudhishthira, "You should also fast sometimes and always be kind to Brahmanas (wise people).  They are very important, and being good to them is very powerful."  He said that the Brahmanas should be given food, clothes, and homes, because they are very special.

So Yudhishthira learned that the greatest way to be good and strong is to be kind and dedicated.  And the best way to show that dedication is to fast and be kind to wise people.
