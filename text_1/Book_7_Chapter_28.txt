Arjuna was a great warrior. He fought bravely in a big battle.  First, he defeated Bhagadatta, a powerful friend of the gods.  Then, two brothers, Vrishaka and Achala, attacked Arjuna. They shot many arrows at him from all sides.

Arjuna was strong! He destroyed their chariot, their horses, and even their weapons. Then, he quickly defeated hundreds of their soldiers.  He even got a new chariot and fought even more bravely.

The brothers kept attacking. They shot many arrows. But Arjuna was too skillful! With just one arrow, he defeated both brave brothers.  They fell from their chariot.

The brothers' family was angry. They threw everything at Arjuna!  They threw clubs, rocks, spears – even magical illusions!  Animals appeared too!  Lions, tigers, and even angry crows attacked him!

But Arjuna was amazing! He used his magic weapons. He shot clouds of arrows, and defeated all the illusions.  The angry animals ran away! Even the magic darkness and water disappeared because of his power.

Then Sakuni, a clever warrior who made magic tricks, got scared and ran away.  Arjuna's arrows flew everywhere, like a storm!  He defeated so many soldiers, that the Kaurava army broke apart.

The battlefield was a mess.  Dead soldiers, dead animals, and broken weapons were everywhere. The soldiers were so scared, they even abandoned their own chariots and friends just to escape Arjuna’s arrows. It was a terrible, but amazing sight!
