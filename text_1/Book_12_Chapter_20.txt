After Yudhishthira finished talking, a wise old man named Devasthana spoke.  He said, "Arjuna said wealth is the best thing.  I will tell you more about that. Listen closely, King Yudhishthira! You won a big kingdom, so don't just give it away!

The Vedas, our holy books, tell us about four ways to live. You should follow them one by one. Right now, you should have big feasts and give lots of gifts to others.  Even holy people do things! They study, they teach, and some even give gifts.  Some people say it's best not to have wealth, but that’s wrong.  We need wealth to give away to good people.

Giving to the wrong people is bad; it's like hurting a baby. It’s hard to know who deserves help. God made wealth for big celebrations, and He made people to use that wealth for good.  So you should use all your wealth for these celebrations. You will be happy!

Look at Indra, the king of the gods! He gave away lots of treasures, and that’s how he became the strongest!  And Lord Shiva, even though he wore simple clothes, gave himself as a gift in a big celebration and became even more powerful!  King Marutta gave away so many gold things that even Indra was impressed!  And King Harischandra gave so much away that he became very happy and important.

So, use your wealth for good celebrations! That’s the best thing to do."
