King Marutta wanted to have a big party, a sacrifice, to please the gods.  He asked his family priest, Vrihaspati, to lead it.  But Vrihaspati said, "Sorry, King! I promised to be the priest for the great god Indra. I can't help you."

King Marutta felt very sad and ashamed. He walked home, feeling terrible.  Then he met Narada, a wise holy man. Narada asked, "What's wrong, King?"

Marutta told Narada about Vrihaspati.  He was so upset, he wanted to give up.

Narada said, "Don't worry! There's another great priest, Samvarta. He's a littleâ€¦ different.  He's wandering around Varanasi, acting a bit crazy."

Narada gave Marutta special instructions. "Go to Varanasi. Put a dead body near the city gate.  The priest who turns away from it is Samvarta. Follow him, and ask him to be your priest."

Marutta did exactly as Narada said.  He saw Samvarta turn away from the dead body.  He followed Samvarta, begging him to lead his sacrifice.  Samvarta was messy! He covered Marutta in mud and spit!  But Marutta kept following him.  Finally, they rested under a big tree.  Samvarta agreed to be the priest.

Marutta learned that even if someone acts strange, being kind and patient can bring good things.  And he finally got his big party!
