Kripa, a wise man, told Ashvatthama a story.  He said, "Being smart isn't enough. You need to be kind and control your anger.  It's like a wooden spoon in soup – it can't taste it, even if it's in there all day!  But your tongue tastes the soup right away.  A wise person learns quickly, even in a short time."

Kripa also said, "Good friends try to stop their friends from doing bad things.  If you listen to your friends, good things happen. If you don't, bad things happen.  It's like calming someone down who's upset – kind words help!"  Kripa warned Ashvatthama, "Don't do anything you'll regret later. Think carefully!"

Kripa explained, "Killing sleeping people is wrong.  It's also wrong to kill people who have put down their weapons, surrendered, or are hurt. The Pancalas are all asleep tonight. To attack them now would be terrible. You're a great warrior, Ashvatthama. You haven't done anything wrong before. Attacking them now would be a terrible stain on your good name. Wait until morning."

Ashvatthama was angry. He said, "The Pandavas broke all the rules!  They killed my father after he put down his weapons. They killed Karna and Bhishma the same way.  They killed many others unfairly.  I heard about Duryodhana's death. It breaks my heart!  The Pancalas are bad, and I will kill them even if it's wrong. I have decided, and nothing will stop me."

Ashvatthama got ready to fight.  Some friends tried to stop him.  He told them, "My father was killed unfairly. I will kill Dhrishtadyumna, the man who killed him, while he's asleep, just like they killed my father!"

Ashvatthama, Kripa, and another warrior went towards the sleeping Pancalas. They were like three bright fires in the night.  They reached the camp, and Ashvatthama stopped at the gate.
