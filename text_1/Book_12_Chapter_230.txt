King Yudhishthira asked, "Who is the best person ever?  Everyone loves him, and he's good at everything!"

Bhishma said, "I'll tell you a story.  Once, King Ugrasena asked Lord Krishna about Narada."

King Ugrasena said, "Everyone talks about how great Narada is.  He must be amazing! Tell me about him, Lord Krishna!"

Lord Krishna said, "Narada is very wise and kind. He's learned, but he's not proud. That's why everyone loves him. He's brave and never gives up.  He's always honest and true.  He's peaceful and kind to everyone.

Narada is always good. He helps everyone. He's happy, and he doesn't get angry or sad when bad things happen to others. He never brags. He's always learning. He listens carefully to others, and he's always fair.  He's smart and talks nicely to everyone. He's generous and never greedy.  He never fights. He's devoted to God. He always does what's right. He's never lazy!

He’s a great teacher, and he's always helping others. He never tells secrets, and he is never too happy or too sad about anything. He is wise and calm. He understands everything, and he is always learning more.  He is always working to help people.  Everyone respects him.”

Lord Krishna finished, "Who wouldn't love someone so good and kind?"
