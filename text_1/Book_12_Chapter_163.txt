Once upon a time, King Yudhishthira asked the wise Bhishma, "Grandpa Bhishma, tell me about all the bad things that make people angry, sad, and mean."

Bhishma said, "My dear boy, there are thirteen bad things, like sneaky wolves waiting to pounce!  They're like super strong enemies for everyone. They make people do bad things and feel sad. These bad things are: anger, lust, envy, bad judgment, sadness, inability to be happy for others, meanness, pride, jealousy, gossip, hate, compassion (in a bad way), and greed."

"Anger comes from wanting things too much," Bhishma explained. "But forgiving others makes anger go away. Lust comes from bad choices, but if you choose to be good, lust disappears. Envy comes from being angry and wanting things.  But being kind and knowing yourself helps you get rid of envy."

"Bad judgment comes from not knowing better," Bhishma continued. "Talking to wise people helps you make better choices. Sadness comes from missing people, but remembering that they canâ€™t come back helps it go away.  Being mean to others comes from anger and greed. Being kind and not caring too much about things helps. Pride comes from being born into a good family, being smart, or being rich.  But understanding these things helps you get rid of pride."

"Jealousy comes from lust and hanging out with bad people," Bhishma said.  "Being wise makes it go away. Gossip comes from saying mean things. Seeing how big the world is helps you stop gossiping. Hate comes when someone is mean to you and you can't fight back. Kindness helps you get over it.  Sometimes people feel sorry for others, but that can be bad if you let it control you.  Understanding good things will help you stop feeling this way. Greed comes from not knowing any better. Seeing how everything changes helps you let go of greed."

Bhishma smiled. "All these bad things can be stopped if you are calm and peaceful inside.  You, Yudhishthira, are a good king because you always try to do good things.  That's why you've overcome all these bad things!"
