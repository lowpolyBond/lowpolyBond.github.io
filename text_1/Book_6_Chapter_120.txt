Once upon a time, during a great battle, the Pandavas fought against Bhishma, a powerful warrior.  Sikhandin, a brave warrior, fought alongside the Pandavas.

Many warriors attacked Bhishma! They threw spears, axes, and arrows.  Bhishma's armor was pierced many times, but he didn't feel any pain.  He was so strong, he looked like a giant fire! His arrows were like flames, his chariot wheels rumbled like thunder, and his bow was like the fire's fierce tongue.

Bhishma fought back bravely! He shot many arrows and hurt many Pandavas, including Bhima and Arjuna. But the Pandavas fought even harder. Sikhandin shot many arrows that hit Bhishma. Arjuna, very angry, even broke Bhishma’s bow!

Other powerful warriors jumped in to help Bhishma, but the Pandavas' friends helped Arjuna.  It was a huge, noisy battle!  Again and again, Arjuna broke Bhishma's bows.

Finally, Bhishma thought, "I could kill all the Pandavas, but I won't. I have a special power – I can choose when I die."  He remembered a promise he made long ago.  Bhishma also knew that Sikhandin's help made it impossible to fairly fight.

Then, something amazing happened!  Wise people from the sky spoke to Bhishma. A gentle breeze blew, flowers fell from the sky, and beautiful music filled the air. Only Bhishma heard these wise voices telling him it was time to rest.

Even though arrows still flew around him, Bhishma accepted his fate. Arjuna kept shooting arrows;  Bhishma didn't even flinch! He was as strong as a mountain!  Bhishma fought on until he fell from his chariot, surrounded by arrows.

Even as he lay there,  Bhishma was still brave. He wanted to die only when the sun was in a specific place in the sky.  He waited patiently, surrounded by the sounds of battle. Heavenly voices even told him to wait.  He waited until he could die at a special time.

When Bhishma finally died, everyone was very sad. The Pandavas and their friends cheered, but the Kauravas, Bhishma's side, were heartbroken.  The battle had changed forever.  Even after death, Bhishma remained a hero.
