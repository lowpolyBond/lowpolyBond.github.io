Once upon a time, a wise man named Narada went to a beautiful place called White Island.  There, he saw people with skin as bright as the moon!  He bowed to them, and they bowed back.

Narada wanted to see the great god Narayana. He stayed on White Island, praying quietly and following very strict rules. He raised his arms and closed his eyes, focusing all his attention on God. Then, he prayed:

"Oh, great God of gods! You are beyond everything! You are everywhere and nowhere at once. You are in every living thing. You are the sun, the moon, the wind, the rain. You are the trees, the rivers, the mountains. You are the king, the fire, the very breath of life!  You are everything, from the biggest things to the smallest, and even the things we can't see! You are the beginning and the end, and everything in between! You are the good and bad things, the happy and sad things.  You are in all the stories and prayers and sacrifices that we do. You created everything, and you are in every heart! Please, let me see you!"


Narada went on and on, listing all the ways Narayana is everywhere and in everything. He talked about all the good things and the hard things, the big things and the small things. It was a very long prayer showing how amazing and powerful Narayana is. He asked to see this wonderful God.  He was very, very respectful and wanted to show his gratitude.
