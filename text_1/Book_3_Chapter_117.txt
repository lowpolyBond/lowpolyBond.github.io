Long ago, a brave man named Rama's father was killed.  Some mean men, Kartavirya's sons, shot him with many arrows.  Rama was very sad. He cried, "My poor father! He was a good man. Why did this happen?"

Rama was so angry! He wanted revenge. He was strong and brave, like a warrior god. He fought the mean men who killed his father.  He defeated them all!  He fought so hard that he made five lakes full of blood.

Afterward, Rama felt bad about all the fighting. He prayed to the gods.  He built a huge, beautiful golden altar and gave it away.  Then, he went to a tall mountain to pray and become peaceful again.

Many years later, Rama met the king, Yudhishthira, and his brothers. The king and his brothers were very happy to see the great Rama. They honored him and listened to his stories. Rama told them to spend the night on the mountain, and then he went on his way.
