Once upon a time, a wise king named Yudhishthira asked a very brave warrior, Bhishma, a question.  He wanted to know how a king should act against a very strong enemy, without having a big army or lots of help.

Bhishma told a story to answer him. It was about the ocean and the rivers.  The ocean was very big and powerful. He noticed something strange.  All the rivers brought him big, strong trees, but never a single cane!

The ocean was puzzled. He asked the rivers, "Why don't you ever bring me any canes? Do you hate them?"

The River Ganga answered, "The trees are stubborn. They don't bend.  So, the river's strong current pulls them out by their roots.  But canes are different. When the current comes, a cane bends.  It lets the water flow past. Then, after the water is gone, the cane stands up straight again."

Ganga explained that the cane was wise. It knew when to be strong and when to be flexible.  It understood that bending wasn't weakness, but a way to survive.  It showed that being too stubborn could be dangerous.

Bhishma then told Yudhishthira what the story meant.  Just like the cane, a king facing a stronger enemy shouldn't be stubborn. He should carefully understand his own strength and the enemy's strength. If the enemy is much stronger, the king should be flexible, like the cane, to survive.  Being wise means knowing when to bend, and when to stand tall.  Thatâ€™s how a king, or anyone, can be safe.
