A wise man named Javali spoke to Rama.  He said, "Rama, you're very kind, but don't be sad.  Everyone is alone in the world. We come alone, and we leave alone.  It’s not right to be too upset about family."

Javali explained it like this: "Think of a traveler. They stay at an inn for a night, then move on.  Our parents, our home, and our things are like that inn. We're with them for a little while, then we go."

"You're young, Rama," Javali continued, "You shouldn’t suffer!  Go back to your kingdom and be king!  The people miss you, and the land needs you.  Have fun, enjoy being king, like Indra in his magical city!"

Javali said, "Your father is gone.  It's sad, but you don't have to make yourself unhappy.  Those who give up everything for some future reward are foolish. They miss out on life's joys!"

Javali pointed out, "People give offerings to their ancestors. But can the dead really eat? It's silly. People made up all these rules about giving things away and being sad so they can get rich and powerful. There is only this world, Rama. Be happy and be king!"
