Once upon a time, there was a brave king named Amvarisha.  A wise man named Narada told a story about him.  Amvarisha was super strong! He fought a thousand kings all by himself!  They were very angry and attacked him with swords and spears. But Amvarisha was so skilled, he broke their weapons and shields!

The kings, scared and tired, gave up. They begged Amvarisha to be kind. He won the battle and became king of the whole land!  Then, Amvarisha held a HUGE feast!  It was the biggest party ever!  There was so much delicious food! Everyone ate yummy cakes, sweet treats, and soup.  Some people drank yummy juice.  Others danced and sang happy songs to celebrate Amvarisha.  Some even fell asleep from having so much fun!

Amvarisha was very generous. He gave away many gifts to the priests and other people at the feast. He even gave away whole kingdoms!  The wise people were amazed. They said, "No king has ever been so kind and generous!"

Sadly, Amvarisha died.  Narada told the story to show that even though Amvarisha died, he was remembered for his bravery and kindness.  He lived a great life filled with adventure and generosity.
