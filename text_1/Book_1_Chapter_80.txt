Once upon a time, there was a powerful teacher named Sukra. He lived with the Asuras, who were like magical beings.  Sukra's daughter, Devayani, was very sad.  The Asura king, Vrishaparvan, had been unkind to her.

Sukra was very angry!  He told Vrishaparvan, "King, bad things always have consequences! Because you were mean to Devayani and you hurt a good man, I'm leaving!"  He was so upset that he wanted to leave and never come back.

Vrishaparvan was scared.  He begged Sukra to stay.  He said, "Please don't go! We'll do anything!"

Sukra said, "Make Devayani happy.  My happiness depends on hers."

Vrishaparvan said, "Sukra, you're the boss!  We'll do whatever you say!"

Sukra told Vrishaparvan to make Devayani happy. Vrishaparvan went to Devayani and asked, "What do you want? I'll give it to you!"

Devayani said, "I want Sarmishtha, the King's other daughter, and a thousand maids to serve me.  Sarmishtha must come with me wherever I go."

Vrishaparvan sent a message to Sarmishtha.  The message said, "Devayani needs you. Please go with her."

Sarmishtha was kind. She said, "I'll do what Devayani wants. I don't want Sukra to leave because of me."

Sarmishtha came with a thousand maids to serve Devayani. Devayani was surprised.  She said, "Sarmishtha, you're a princess! Why would you serve me?"

Sarmishtha said, "It's important to help family, even if it means serving someone."

Devayani was happy. She told her father, "I'm happy now! You can stay with the Asuras."

Sukra was also happy. He went back to the Asuras, and they were all very happy to have him.  They all lived happily ever after!
