Once upon a time, a good king named Yudhishthira wanted to be the best king he could be. He asked the wise Bhishma, "How can a king always do what's right?"

Bhishma said, "Let me tell you a story!  Long ago, there was a very smart king named Vasumanas. He asked a wise man named Vamadeva, 'How can I be a good king and never do wrong?'"

Vamadeva said, "Being good and fair is the most important thing! Kings who are good rule the whole land. A good king listens to wise advice and always does what is right.  But a king who is mean and uses force will lose everything.

A king who listens to bad advisors will become bad himself, and his people might even get rid of him!  A king who is silly and boasts will also fail, even if he rules a big kingdom.

But a kind king who is smart and controls his feelings will be very successful and rich, like a river that gets bigger with many streams joining it. He should always try to be better. He needs good friends, and he needs to be smart and strong.  These things are important to rule well.

A good king gets fame and happiness by following this advice.  He thinks carefully before he acts.  But a mean king who is unkind and punishes people too much will fail.  A king who isn't smart won't see his own mistakes. He'll be unhappy in this life and the next.

A good king honors those who deserve it, gives gifts, and always speaks kindly.  His people will help him through hard times.  But a king who doesn't listen to wise people and only does what he feels like, will never be happy for long.  A king who listens to his teachers, watches over his kingdom carefully, and always tries to be good, will be happy for a very long time!"
