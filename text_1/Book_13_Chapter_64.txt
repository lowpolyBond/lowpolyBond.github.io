Once upon a time, a wise king named Yudhishthira wanted to know the best time to give gifts. He asked the great warrior Bhishma.

Bhishma said, "I'll tell you a story.  A long time ago, a very holy man named Narada visited Devaki.  She asked him about giving gifts and the stars."

Narada said, "Giving gifts at the right time makes them extra special!  Each star has its own lucky gift."

"If you give creamy rice pudding under the Krittika star," Narada explained, "you'll go to a wonderful happy place after you die!"

"Under the Rohini star," he continued, "give meat, rice, and milk to the poor. It's like paying back a debt of kindness."

Narada went on to tell Devaki about many more stars:

* **Somadaivata:** Give a cow and calf – you'll go to heaven!
* **Mrigasiras:** Give special food while fasting – it helps you avoid trouble later.
* **Punarvasu:** Give cakes – you'll be beautiful and famous!
