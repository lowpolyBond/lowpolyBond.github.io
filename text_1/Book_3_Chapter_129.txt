Long ago, a wise man named Lomasa told King Yudhishthira a story about a very special place.  He said, "This is a magical place!  Many great kings and holy people came here a long, long time ago."

He told about a king named Amvarisha who did a big, important ceremony that lasted one thousand years!  He also talked about Yayati, a very strong and good king who even competed with the king of the gods, Indra!  Yayati did his own special ceremonies right here, and the ground is still marked from where he built his sacred fires.

Lomasa pointed out a special tree with only one leaf, some beautiful lakes, and even the place where a famous holy man, Parasurama, made his lakes.  He described the path where another powerful holy man walked.  He even told a story about a funny goblin who gave advice to a woman!

Lomasa explained that King Bharata, a great and fair king, performed his own special ceremony here too.  He even let a special horse go free as part of it!  Another king, Marutta, also did important ceremonies at this same special place.

Lomasa said, "This whole area is holy!  If you bathe here, you'll feel pure and see all the worlds!"

Then, Yudhishthira, a very good prince, bathed in the special place with his brothers.  The holy people there were happy to see him.  Yudhishthira said, "This place is amazing!  I can see everywhere!" He even saw his brother Arjuna from there!

Lomasa told him, "Yes, this is a very holy place.  Many saints did their ceremonies here, and it's right next to the beautiful Saraswati River, a very important river. If you bathe here, all your bad deeds will go away."  He pointed out a huge space where the gods themselves performed ceremonies.  "This is where the Kurus, your family, used to perform their ceremonies too!" Lomasa concluded.
