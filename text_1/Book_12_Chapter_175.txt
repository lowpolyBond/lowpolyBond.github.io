Once upon a time, a wise king named Yudhishthira asked his grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandpa, time keeps moving, and everything changes. What's the most important thing to do in life?"

Bhishma smiled and told a story. "Long ago," he said, "a very smart boy named Medhavin talked to his father, a learned man who studied holy books. Medhavin said, 'Father, life is short! What should I do to live a good life?'"

The father said, "My son, first, you should study the holy books. Then, have a family.  Build a home and perform ceremonies. Finally, go to a quiet place to think and meditate."

But Medhavin worried. "Father," he said, "the world is in danger! Death is everywhere, and we get old and weak. How can we just calmly follow this plan?"

His father asked, "What danger? What are you talking about?"

Medhavin said, "Death! Old age! Every night that passes makes us closer to death.  It's like a fish in a little puddle—it's trapped!  Death comes quickly, even when we're happy and doing what we enjoy. It's like a tiger stealing a sleeping deer."

"So," Medhavin said, "we should do good things *now*, not later!  Don't wait!  Do today what you planned for tomorrow. Death doesn't wait!"

"Be good," Medhavin continued. "If you are good, you will be remembered, and you will have a happy life after this one. People waste their time on family and things they want, but death can take them away anytime!"

"Death comes for everyone," Medhavin explained.  "The rich, the poor, the strong, the weak – it doesn't matter. Living in a busy town or village is like being tied up by death. Living quietly in the forest is better, like keeping your senses safe in a pen."

"The only thing stronger than death is Truth," Medhavin said. "Be truthful. Be kind.  Don't hurt anyone.  Then death won't have such power over you.  I will live my life honestly, and do what is right. I won't let fear control me."

Bhishma finished the story. "So, King Yudhishthira," he said, "live your life like that father did, always following the truth."
