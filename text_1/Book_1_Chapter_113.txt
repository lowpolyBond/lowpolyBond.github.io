Once upon a time, in the land of Hastinapura, King Pandu needed a second wife.  His wise uncle, Bhishma, decided to find him one!

Bhishma, with a big army and important advisors, traveled to a faraway kingdom ruled by a kind king named Salya.  He asked for Salya's beautiful sister, Madri, to marry Pandu.

King Salya was happy to help, but his family had a special custom.  It was an old tradition, and he couldn't break it. Bhishma understood. He gave King Salya lots of amazing gifts: gold, jewels, elephants, horses, and beautiful clothes.  King Salya, happy with the gifts, agreed to let Madri marry Pandu.

Bhishma took Madri back to Hastinapura. Pandu and Madri got married on a special day.  After the wedding, Pandu lived happily with his two wives.

After a month, Pandu decided to go on a big adventure! He wanted to conquer many lands. He said goodbye to his family and went to war with a giant army. He was brave and strong!

Pandu defeated many enemies. He won many battles! He got lots of treasures â€“ gold, jewels, and even elephants! He was very famous. Everyone was proud of him.

When Pandu returned to Hastinapura, everyone was so happy!  They welcomed him with joyful celebrations. Bhishma was so proud of his nephew. Everyone cheered for Pandu, the brave king!
