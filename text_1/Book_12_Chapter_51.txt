Once upon a time, after a great battle, King Yudhishthira heard amazing stories about Rama, a powerful warrior.  He told Krishna, his friend, "Rama was so strong, he was like a god!  Even the kings were scared of him!"

Many kings had hidden from Rama, some with cows, some in the ocean, even with leopards and monkeys! Yudhishthira was amazed that a wise man like Rama could do such amazing and good things.

Then Yudhishthira and Krishna went to visit Bhishma, a great warrior who was lying hurt on a bed of arrows.  He looked like the sun setting, surrounded by many wise people.  The place was very holy, near a river.

Krishna and the Pandava brothers got off their chariots and went to greet the wise men.  They bowed and sat near Bhishma.  Krishna looked at Bhishma, who was very weak, and asked gently, "Bhishma, are you still feeling okay?  Are you in a lot of pain?"

Krishna knew Bhishma had a special power. He could choose when to die!  Krishna said, "Bhishma, you're so wise! You know everything about the past, present, and future. You've always done what's right. Even when you could have had a comfortable life, you chose to follow the right path. No one is as brave and good as you are!"

Krishna went on, "You're like a god among men! You know everything about being a good person and a great warrior.  You could even create a whole new world! Please, help Yudhishthira. He's very sad because so many of his family died in the war.  You're the only one who can comfort him."

Bhishma, hearing Krishna's words, bowed his head. He said, "Krishna, you are everything! You are the beginning and the end, the creator and destroyer of the world. You are amazing!  I see your true power now.  Tell me, what should I do?"

Krishna said, "Bhishma, because you are so good and devoted to me, I show you my true form. But I only do that for the purest of hearts.  You have only 56 days left to live.  Then you'll go to a wonderful place where you'll never return.   Many people are here to learn from you before you go. Please, teach Yudhishthira, and help him feel better."
