Once upon a time, in a great battle, Ghatotkacha, a powerful giant, defeated a warrior.  He roared with victory, scaring all the other soldiers!  Karna, a strong warrior on the other side, saw this and attacked. He shot many arrows, making many other warriors shake with fear.  The battle was loud and wild, like a summer thunderstorm!

Karna was strong and brave; he stood like a mountain, blocking all the arrows shot at him. He broke many flags and wounded many soldiers.  Many soldiers ran away to hide. Ghatotkacha was furious!  He roared like a lion, attacked Karna, and they fought fiercely, showering each other with arrows.  It was a beautiful, but scary, sight!

Ghatotkacha was so powerful that he couldn't beat Karna.  So, he used a magical trick! He used a special weapon, killing Karna's horses and driver. Then, poof! Ghatotkacha disappeared!

The other soldiers were terrified. They thought Ghatotkacha would return and defeat Karna. Karna fought bravely, shooting so many arrows that it was dark all around.

Then, Ghatotkacha made a magical cloud appear in the sky! It rained down fire, weapons, and rocks.  Many soldiers were hurt and afraid.  Many of them ran away, crying out in fear.  The giant's magic was truly frightening!

But Karna was brave! He kept fighting, but the magical weapons kept coming.  Finally, Ghatotkacha threw a special wheel that killed Karna's horses.  Karna, even without his horses, did not give up.

The other soldiers begged Karna to defeat Ghatotkacha.  Karna, angry and determined, threw his most powerful weapon.  It was a special spear, a gift from a god! The spear flew, destroying the magic cloud and hitting Ghatotkacha.

Ghatotkacha roared one last time and fell, even though he remained powerful even in death, crushing many soldiers with his huge body. The other warriors cheered because Ghatotkacha was defeated! Karna, a hero, was praised by everyone.
