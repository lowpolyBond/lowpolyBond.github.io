Once upon a time, the Pandava brothers were exploring a mountain.  They heard strange noises and couldn't find Bhima, the strongest brother.  Everyone worried!  They left Draupadi with a friend and climbed the mountain to find him.

At the top, they saw Bhima!  He had defeated a bunch of giant, scary Rakshasas (monsters). They were all knocked out. Bhima looked super strong, like a brave warrior!  The Pandavas hugged him and were so happy to see him safe.

But Yudhishthira, the oldest brother, was worried.  He said, "Bhima, you killed all those Rakshasas!  That's not right.  Even if you were defending yourselves, killing so many is wrong.  It can upset even the gods!" He told Bhima to be careful.  Yudhishthira thought about what happened.

Meanwhile, the Rakshasas who had escaped ran to Kuvera, the king of the Yakshas (another kind of magical being).  They cried, "Bhima, a human, killed all our friends!  Even Maniman, Kuvera’s friend, is dead!"

Kuvera got really angry. He shouted, "What?!"  He jumped in his magical flying chariot, pulled by golden horses, and zoomed to the mountain with lots of Yakshas.  They were ready for a fight!

But when they saw the Pandavas, Kuvera was surprised. He liked their bravery.  The Pandavas bowed down to him respectfully.  Kuvera, sitting in his beautiful chariot, explained everything.

Kuvera told them, "It’s alright, Bhima. The Rakshasas were going to die anyway, because of a curse. You were just the one who made it happen.  You accidentally helped me break a terrible curse!"

Yudhishthira asked, "What curse?"

Kuvera said, "Long ago, my friend Maniman was very rude to a powerful wise man named Agastya. Agastya got very angry and cursed me. He said my army would be destroyed by a human, but I’d be free from the curse after it happened.  Bhima, you broke the curse! That's why I'm happy."  Everyone was relieved and happy, and the adventure ended.
