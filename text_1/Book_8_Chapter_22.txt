Once upon a time, during a big battle in the Mahabharata, Arjuna's son and his army attacked Dhrishtadyumna.  Lots of brave elephant riders charged towards him, wanting to defeat him.

These elephant riders came from many different places –  the East, the South, and many other kingdoms. They threw spears and arrows like rain from the sky!  It was a huge attack on Dhrishtadyumna and his soldiers.

A brave warrior named Prishata’s son shot so many arrows at the elephants, even the biggest ones, that they fell down.  The elephants were HUGE, like mountains!

When Dhrishtadyumna was surrounded by elephants, his friends came to save him.  Nakula, Sahadeva, the sons of Draupadi, Satyaki, Shikhandi, and many more brave heroes rushed to help. They threw arrows and spears at the elephants, too, fighting bravely.

The elephant riders were very fierce. They used their elephants to push and crush the enemy soldiers and their chariots.  Some soldiers were even lifted high into the air by the elephants' tusks, before being thrown to the ground!

Satyaki was super strong. He killed a huge elephant and its rider with his sharp spears!  Sahadeva also killed a huge elephant with his arrows.  Then Nakula fought bravely against an elephant and its rider from the Anga kingdom, cutting off the king’s head with a special arrow.

The other Anga riders got angry and attacked Nakula.  Many more elephant riders came to fight him – from many different places. Again, the heroes fought bravely, shooting arrows like rain at the elephants until they all fell down!

After defeating all those elephants, the Pandava heroes looked around. The enemy army was running away, scared!  The heroes then turned their attention to Karna, ready for the next part of the big battle!
