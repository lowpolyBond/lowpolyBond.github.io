Once upon a time, in a great battle, the Pandavas were fighting the Kauravas.  A brave warrior named Abhimanyu, Arjuna's son, bravely fought Drona's army.  He fought so bravely! But many warriors surrounded him. They were much stronger.  They took away his chariot.  Poor Abhimanyu couldn't fight anymore.  Sadly, he died.

Yudhishthira, the Pandava king, was very sad.  He told Arjuna, "Abhimanyu was killed! Jayadratha stopped us from helping him!"

Arjuna was heartbroken.  He was very, very angry! He made a big promise. He said, "Tomorrow, I will kill Jayadratha! I swear it!"

Arjuna was so angry that he even said, "If I don't kill Jayadratha, I will go to a bad place, even worse than people who hurt their parents or teachers!"  He promised he'd face anyone who tried to protect Jayadratha, even Drona or Kripa.

Arjuna was very serious.  He strung his bow, Gandiva.  The sound was so loud, it reached the sky!  Krishna, his friend, blew his conch shell, Panchajanya.  The sound was HUGE, like the end of the world!  The Pandava army cheered. Everyone knew Arjuna was going to get revenge for Abhimanyu.
