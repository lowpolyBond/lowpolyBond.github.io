Once upon a time, there was a huge battle between two armies: the Pandavas and the Kauravas.  Sanjaya, a wise man, watched and told the story.

He said, “The soldiers fought crazily!  It wasn't just knights fighting knights, or soldiers fighting soldiers, or elephants fighting elephants. Everyone fought everyone!”  The battle was terrible, with lots of dead soldiers and elephants everywhere.

Then, some strong Kaurava heroes—Salya, Kripa, Chitrasena, Dussasana, and Vikarna—made the Pandavas very scared.  The Pandava army started to fall back, like a boat in a storm.  Bhishma, a powerful Kaurava warrior, was especially strong. He hurt many Pandavas.  But Arjuna, a brave Pandava warrior, fought back bravely and killed many Kaurava elephants and soldiers.  The battlefield was sad and full of dead warriors.

Many Pandavas wanted to fight bravely and go to heaven when they died. They remembered how the Kauravas had hurt them and weren't scared.

Dhrishtadyumna, the Pandavas’ leader, told his soldiers to attack Bhishma.  Bhishma was a super-strong warrior.  He’d learned to fight from Rama a long time ago.  For many days, he killed thousands of soldiers, elephants, and horses. He was amazing!

On the tenth day, Bhishma was even more powerful. He killed so many soldiers and elephants that no one dared to look at him. He was like the sun, shining brightly and burning everything.  Krishna, a wise helper of the Pandavas, told Arjuna, “Only you can defeat Bhishma.”

Arjuna was very strong, but Bhishma was even stronger.  Arjuna showered Bhishma with arrows, but Bhishma fought back with his own arrows.  Many brave Pandava warriors like Bhima, the twins, and Satyaki tried to fight Bhishma, but it was very hard.  They were very sad and felt hopeless.

Then, Sikhandin, a brave warrior, stepped forward.  Because of Sikhandin's position, Bhishma couldn't attack him.  Arjuna hid behind Sikhandin, and together they fought Bhishma.  Many other Pandava warriors fought alongside Arjuna and Sikhandin, helping to finally defeat Bhishma.   The battle was long and hard, but the Pandavas won because they worked together.
