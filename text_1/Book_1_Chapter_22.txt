Once upon a time, there were some snake people called Nagas.  Their mother was very powerful. She told them to do something important.  They were scared! If they didn't do what she wanted, she might get angry and hurt them all.  So, they agreed to help her.  Their task? To make a horse's tail turn black!  To do this, they turned into tiny hairs on the horse's tail.

Now, there were two sisters, Kadru and Vinata. They were like stepsisters, and they made a bet.  They flew up, up, up in the sky!  They were going on a long trip.

As they flew, they saw a HUGE ocean.  It was so big and powerful!  Big waves crashed!  There were giant fish, scary monsters, and sparkling jewels hidden inside.  It was the home of the water god and many other amazing creatures. The ocean was deep, dark, and mysterious. But the sisters flew right over it!  It was a very exciting journey!

And that's the end of that part of the story!
