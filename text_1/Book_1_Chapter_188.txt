Princess Draupadi was ready for her Swayamvara!  This was a big, exciting contest to find her husband.  Lots and lots of princes wanted to marry her!

Dhrishtadyumna, her uncle, told her all the important princes who had come.  There were Duryodhana, his brothers, and many, many more!  They were all strong and brave warriors.

Karna, a famous warrior, was there too.  And many other kings came from faraway lands.  There was Aswatthaman, a very famous warrior, and Bhoja, a very rich king.  So many princes came, with their friends and soldiers!  Even the powerful Jarasandha came!

There were even more! Virata came with his sons.  Bhagadatta was there, strong and brave. Salya, the king of Madra, came with his son.  Many, many Kuru princes came to try their luck.

And thenâ€¦ the best part!  Krishna and his friends came too.  They were strong and brave.  They were all from the Vrishni clan, famous for their bravery and skills.  Even Arjuna's friends came!  They all wanted to see who would win the contest.


Dhrishtadyumna explained, "All these brave princes want to marry you.  They will try to shoot a special arrow. Whoever can hit the target will win your hand in marriage!"  Draupadi listened carefully. She was excited to see who would win!
