King Yudhishthira saw his cousin Krishna very still. Krishna's eyes were closed, and he didn't seem to be moving at all.  Yudhishthira was worried.  "Krishna," he asked, "are you okay?  You're so quiet and still! What's happening?"

Krishna was doing yoga – a special kind of meditation. He was so peaceful that his body was like a statue!  Yudhishthira was amazed. He begged Krishna to explain. "Please, Krishna, tell me why you're like this," he pleaded.

Krishna smiled gently.  "My dear Yudhishthira," he said, "I'm thinking of Bhishma.  Bhishma, the brave warrior, is lying hurt on a bed of arrows. He's very close to death."

Krishna explained that Bhishma was a truly great warrior. He was so strong that even the gods were amazed. Bhishma was a wise and learned man, too. He knew everything about being good and living a good life.  Krishna felt connected to Bhishma and was focusing on him.

Krishna said, "Bhishma is a wonderful teacher.  He knows so much! After he's gone, the world will miss all his knowledge. You should go talk to him before he leaves.  Ask him anything you want to know."

Yudhishthira agreed.  He was very sad to hear about Bhishma. He knew Bhishma was an amazing person.

Yudhishthira said, "Krishna, you're the greatest! Please come with us to see Bhishma."

Krishna said, "Of course!"  He called his charioteer, Daruka, and told him to get his chariot ready. The chariot was beautiful – shining gold, with bright jewels and a magnificent Garuda on the flag!  Strong horses were harnessed to it, and they set off to see Bhishma.
