Once upon a time, a wise man named Vidura gave King Dhritarashtra some very important advice. He said, "When an older person visits, a young person's heart feels happy!  Showing respect – saying hello and offering them a seat – makes the heart happy again.  A good host offers water to wash their feet, asks them how they are, and then offers them food.

It's really bad to be stingy!  Even if a guest isn't perfect, you should always offer them water.  A really good person, like a wise holy man, shouldn't sell things like food or clothes.

A truly peaceful person isn't angry or sad. They don't care about praise or blame. They're calm, like someone living far away from the busy world. The best holy men live simply in the forest, helping others.

If you hurt someone, don't think you're safe just because they're far away! Smart people can always find a way to get back at you.  Never trust someone you shouldn't, and don't trust *too much* someone you should.  Trusting the wrong person can cause big trouble.

Be kind to your wife, but don't let her boss you around.  Good wives are like treasure!  Let your father watch over the house, your mother the kitchen, and someone you trust the animals.  You should take care of the farm yourself.

Remember, fire comes from water, strong warriors come from holy men, and iron comes from stone.  The power of these things is great, but it's calmed when it goes back to its source.  Strong people don't always show how strong they really are.  The best kings secretly learn what others are planning.

Never tell anyone your plans!  Keep your secrets safe.  Only tell your most trusted friends and advisors your secret plans. And always be careful who you choose as your advisors!  A good king keeps his plans secret until they are done. Doing good things is always easier than doing bad things.

Good kings know their money and what's happening in their kingdom.  They share their wealth and don't keep everything for themselves.  The best kings are smart and know when to fight, and when to be kind. When you're weak, you might have to be nice to your enemies for a while. But if you can, defeat them in the end.

Always try to control your anger, especially towards older people, kids, and anyone who can't protect themselves.  Smart people avoid silly fights!  People don't want a leader who's not fair and only gets angry sometimes.

Being clever isn't just about getting rich.  Being lazy isn't what causes problems. Only smart people truly understand why some people are lucky and others are not.  Fools don't listen to wise people.  Bad people, liars, and those who are mean always get into trouble.  Good leaders are honest, kind, and careful with their words.  Even poor, honest people can find good friends and helpers.

Never trust people who are lazy, dishonest or mean.  If you make someone angry, make peace with them quickly, or you won't sleep well!  Don't trust people who are bad at their jobs or are dishonest.  You shouldn't depend on a woman, a liar, or a child for important decisions.

You, Dhritarashtra, have left the strongest warriors and trusted Duryodhana.  Your riches will soon disappear.  Just like a powerful king can lose everything."
