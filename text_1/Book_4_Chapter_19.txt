Draupadi was very sad.  She told Bhima, "I have so much to worry about!  Don't be mad at me for talking about it.  It breaks my heart to see you all like this."

She sighed. "Look at you, Bhima! You, the strongest warrior, are working as a cook!  Everyone calls you 'Vallava the cook.' It's so upsetting.  When you're done cooking, you sit sadly beside King Virata.  It makes me so sad."

"And then," Draupadi continued, "the king makes you fight elephants for fun! The women in the palace laugh.  It's awful!  Or you fight lions and tigers, and Princess Kaikeyi watches. I almost faint!"

"Kaikeyi and her ladies rush over to help. They see I've just fainted, not hurt.  Kaikeyi says, 'She's in love with the handsome cook!  They're both beautiful, and they arrived here together.  That's why she's so sad when he fights!'  She thinks I'm in love with you, Bhima!  That hurts even more."

Draupadi cried.  "And Arjuna, my husband's brother, the greatest warrior! He's now a dance teacher for King Virata's daughters!  He's wearing earrings and braids â€“ things only women wear. The great Arjuna, who used to fight bravely, is now surrounded by women. I can barely stand it!"

"And Sahadeva, the youngest, is a cowherd!  He takes care of cows and sleeps on cow hides.  My mother-in-law, Kunti, loves him so much. She used to say he was so sweet and kind. To see him like this...it's heartbreaking."

"Nakula, once so strong, now trains horses for the king. He looks so handsome but his life is sad.

"All my brothers-in-law are hiding and working ordinary jobs! Yudhishthira's suffering too, and I feel so helpless. Looking at all of you like this, while you are still alive but suffering,  makes me want to die."  Draupadi sobbed. "These worries are too much for me. Please tell me, Bhima, what can I do?"
