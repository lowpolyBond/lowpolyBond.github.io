Once upon a time, Prince Rama was asked to leave his home and live in the forest for fourteen years.  He was very kind, and he said, "I don't need riches or an army!  I'll just need clothes made of tree bark, a shovel to dig for food, and some baskets."

His stepmother, Kaikeyi, sadly brought him the bark clothes. Rama put them on, and his brother Lakshmana did too.  Rama's wife, Sita, was surprised. She didn't know how to wear bark clothes!  She looked sad and confused. Rama gently helped her put them on.

Many people cried. They didn't want Sita to go to the forest. They begged Rama to leave Sita behind. They said, "She's a princess! The forest is too hard for her!"

But Sita wanted to go with Rama. She loved him very much, and she wouldn't leave him.

Their wise teacher, Vasishtha, was angry with Kaikeyi. He said, "You only asked for Rama to go! Sita should stay here as a princess!"  He told Sita to wear beautiful clothes, not bark clothes.

But Sita didn't want to change her clothes. She wanted to share Ramaâ€™s hardships.  She was determined to go to the forest with her husband.  And so, she went with Rama to the forest, wearing her simple bark clothes. Even though it was hard, she was happy to be with the one she loved.
