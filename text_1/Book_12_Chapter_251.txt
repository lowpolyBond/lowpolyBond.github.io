Long ago, in a land far away, a wise teacher named Vyasa told a story. He said, "Being a good person isn't about fancy things."

"It's not about yummy food, pretty clothes, or being famous," Vyasa explained. "Real goodness is about being kind to everyone."

He said, "Even if you know all the holy books, it doesn't make you good.  It's about treating everyone like family.  If you're happy knowing who you really are, you'll never really die. That's true goodness."

Vyasa continued, "Doing good deeds is important, but it's not enough.  You must also be kind and not want things you don't need.  If you're not afraid of anyone, and nobody is afraid of you, you're truly good."

He said, "The only thing that traps us is wanting things too much. Let go of wanting things, and you'll be free, like the moon shining bright after the clouds disappear."

"Being good is like a ladder," Vyasa said. "At the bottom is telling the truth. Then comes controlling what you want. Then comes sharing with others, then being patient, then giving up wanting things, and finally, happiness. Happiness leads to peace, and peace is the best thing of all."

Vyasa explained that true happiness comes from inside. "Imagine your heart like a calm ocean.  Even if many rivers of wishes pour into it, the ocean stays calm.  That's true peace.  Donâ€™t let your heart be tossed around by wishes for toys or treats."


Vyasa said, "The wisest people understand their own inner selves, the part of them that never dies. They don't worry about getting older or dying because they know who they truly are. They are happy and peaceful."  He added, "The best way to be good is to help those who are hungry or poor, and those who are weak."

"Someone who is truly good," Vyasa concluded, "is like the sun, chasing away shadows.  They're free from worries, and nothing can hurt them, not even getting old or dying. They are always peaceful and happy."
