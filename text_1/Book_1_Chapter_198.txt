Once upon a time, after a big contest, the Pandava brothers were going to marry Draupadi.  Everyone was very excited!  But then, a wise man named Vyasa asked a very important question: "Can one woman marry many men without it being wrong?"

King Drupada, Draupadi's father, said, "No! That's not right.  It's against the rules."  His son, Dhrishtadyumna, agreed.  He said it was confusing and didn't seem fair.

Then, Yudhishthira, the oldest Pandava brother, spoke. He said, "I always tell the truth.  But I heard a story about a woman who married many wise men, and another who married ten brothers!  Also, Mother Kunti told us to share Draupadi, like sharing something we received as a gift."

Kunti, their mother, said, "Yes, that's what I said. I hope I'm not doing something wrong."

Vyasa, the wise man, smiled. He said, "There are ancient stories that explain this.  It's okay, it's all right." He then took King Drupada aside to explain privately.  The Pandavas, Kunti, and Dhrishtadyumna waited patiently. Vyasa would explain how it was all going to be okay.  And so, Draupadi married all five Pandava brothers.
