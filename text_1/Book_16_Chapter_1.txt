Long ago, after a big war, strange things happened.  Yudhishthira, the king, saw scary signs.  The wind blew hard, the rivers flowed backward, and the sun looked cloudy and strange.  It was like the world was upset.

Then, Yudhishthira heard terrible news.  Most of his friends, the Vrishnis, were gone!  Only two, Vasudeva and Rama, were left.  Yudhishthira and his brothers were very, very sad.  They couldn't believe it.

Janamejaya asked, "How did all those brave Vrishnis, Andhakas, and Bhojas die?"

It all started a long time ago.  Some clever Vrishni heroes tricked some wise men, the Rishis.  They pretended a woman was Vabhruâ€™s wife and asked the Rishis if she would have a son.  The Rishis were angry.  They said the woman's "son" (who was actually a man named Samva in disguise) would bring a terrible iron bolt that would destroy almost all the Vrishnis and Andhakas. Only Rama and Janarddana would live.

Krishna, the best of the Vrishnis, knew this would happen.  He said, "What's meant to be, will be."

The next day, Samva, brought forth a scary iron bolt!  It caused a huge disaster, killing nearly everyone.  King Ugrasena was heartbroken. He ordered everyone to throw the iron bolt's dust into the sea.  He also made a new rule: No more making wine or strong drinks!  Everyone agreed because they were afraid, and they respected Rama and Krishna.
