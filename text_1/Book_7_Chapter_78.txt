Subhadra was very, very sad.  Her son, Abhimanyu, had died in battle.  She cried and cried.  "My brave son!" she wailed. "You were as strong as your father!  Why did you have to go to war? Your beautiful face, like a blue lotus, is now covered in dust. My dear boy, with your strong arms and beautiful ornaments, now lies wounded on the battlefield. Everyone sees you, my son, like the moon rising in the sky, but you are hurt. You, who slept on soft beds, now lie on the hard ground, pierced by arrows.  You, who were waited on by beautiful women, are now with jackals.  You, praised by singers, are now with wild animals.  The Pandavas and the Panchalas were supposed to protect you!  Oh, my son, my perfect son, I can't bear to look at you. I will soon die of sorrow. When will I ever see your kind face again?  I hate the strength of Bhima, the arrows of Arjuna, the power of the Vrishni warriors, and the might of the Panchalas! They couldn't save my son!"

Subhadra cried so much she fainted. Draupadi and Uttara, who were also very sad, fainted too.  Krishna, Subhadra's brother, rushed to help. He sprinkled water on them and said, "Don't cry, Subhadra.  Abhimanyu was a great warrior, and he died bravely. He reached a wonderful place. Let everyone else fight like him and achieve the same great end." Krishna comforted them all, then went back to Arjuna.
