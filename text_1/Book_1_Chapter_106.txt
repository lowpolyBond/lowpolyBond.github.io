Once upon a time, a princess from a faraway kingdom was married to a king.  After some time, the king sadly died.  His mother, Satyavati, was very sad. She wanted her grandsons to keep the royal family going.

Satyavati had a plan.  She knew a wise man, Vyasa.  Vyasa was a little scary-looking, with long, dark hair and a big beard.  

First, Satyavati asked the princess to have a baby with Vyasa. The princess was scared of Vyasa’s scary looks, but she did as she was asked.  Vyasa made the princess a promise; her baby boy would be very strong, like ten thousand elephants! But, because she was so afraid, her son would be born blind. His name was Dhritarashtra.

Next, Satyavati asked the king's second wife, Ambalika, to have a baby with Vyasa.  Ambalika was also very scared of Vyasa. She turned pale with fear.  Her baby, Pandu, was born with pale skin, because of his mother’s fear.

The king's first wife was still very scared of Vyasa. She didn't want to meet him. Instead, she sent her prettiest servant girl to meet Vyasa. The servant girl was brave.  Vyasa had a baby with the servant girl, and he was very happy with her. This baby was named Vidura. He grew up to be a very wise and good man.

Vyasa, with his magic, helped the family continue, even though it was a bit strange! Dhritarashtra, Pandu, and Vidura were brothers. Even though Dhritarashtra was blind, and Pandu was pale, they had amazing lives. Pandu became a great king, and his sons became very famous heroes, the Pandavas!  And that’s how the Kuru family continued.
