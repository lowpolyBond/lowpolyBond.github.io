Once upon a time, a wise man named Gautama visited a powerful Rakshasa king.  The king was very curious about Gautama. He asked him lots of questions about where he came from and what he did. Gautama only told the king his name and where he lived.

The king then asked, "Where's your home, and who is your wife?"

Gautama answered honestly, "I live in a hunter's village.  My wife is a widow from a lower caste."

The king thought for a bit. He was a friend of Rajadharman, a very special crane, who had sent Gautama to him.  The king wanted to be kind to his friend's guest.  That day, he was having a big party for a thousand learned Brahmins.  

"I'll invite Gautama too!" the king decided. "He can share the food and gifts!"

Soon, a thousand Brahmins arrived, all dressed beautifully.  The king welcomed them with lots of yummy food, gifts of gold, jewels, and precious stones. He told them, "Take whatever you want!"  

Gautama also received many gifts. He carried a heavy bag of gold back to the big banyan tree where he'd met Rajadharman, the crane.  He was tired and hungry.

Rajadharman, his good friend, soon arrived. He fanned Gautama with his wings and helped him find food.

After eating, Gautama started to feel bad.  "This gold is heavy," he thought. "I'm far from home, and I'm hungry.  I have no food for my journeyâ€¦"

Then, he had a terrible idea.  He looked at Rajadharman, the kind crane who had helped him, and thought, "I could kill the crane and eat him!" He was very ungrateful and selfish.
