The night ended, and Arjuna and his brothers went to see their brother, Yudhishthira.  Suddenly, BOOM!  Amazing sounds filled the air!  It sounded like music, car wheels, and bells!  Animals and birds were making loud noises, too!

Then, shiny chariots like the sun arrived!  Beautiful creatures called Gandharvas and Apsaras flew in, following a very important person: Indra, the King of the Gods!  Indra, who is super strong and handsome, rode a golden chariot pulled by powerful horses. He looked like a big, beautiful storm cloud!  

Indra got out of his chariot.  Yudhishthira and his brothers went to greet him. They bowed down to show respect. Arjuna, the bravest warrior, bowed so low he looked like a servant!  He had long, matted hair.

Yudhishthira was so happy to see Arjuna so humble! He felt really proud.  Indra smiled. Then he said to Yudhishthira, "You will be king!  You will rule the land! Go back to Kamyaka forest!"

A wise man said that if you listen carefully to this story of Indra meeting the Pandavas and you are good and follow the rules, you will live a long and happy life!
