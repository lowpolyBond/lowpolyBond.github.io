King Yudhishthira asked his grandpa Bhishma, "Grandpa, what's the best kind of city for a king to live in? Should he choose a ready-made city or build a new one?"

Bhishma smiled.  "That's a great question, Yudhishthira! A king's city needs to be safe and strong.  There are six types of strong cities: cities near water, cities surrounded by earthworks, cities built in the hills, cities protected by lots of people, cities built of mud, and cities hidden in forests.

Your city should be amazing! It needs strong walls and a deep ditch for protection.  It should be full of food, weapons, elephants, horses, and chariots.  Lots of clever people who build things and know lots of things should live there.  The city should have lots of food stored away.  Everyone should be kind and helpful.  It should have beautiful squares and shops, happy music, and big, comfortable houses. Brave and wealthy people should live there.  Everyone should worship the gods and celebrate festivals.

The king should always be working to make his kingdom better! He needs to fill his treasury with money, have a strong army, make lots of friends, and have fair courts of law. He needs to stop bad things from happening. He should make sure there is always lots of food, weapons, and other important things, like wood, iron, and medicine.

He should be kind to teachers, priests, brave warriors, builders, stargazers, and doctors. He should treat everyone fairly, rewarding good people and punishing bad ones. The king should use spies to find out what people are thinking and planning. He needs to keep a close eye on his money and army.  The king should be a good friend to the gods, always praying and being kind to everyone. He should protect the weak, the poor, and the old. He should be very kind to holy men, giving them gifts and asking for their wisdom.  He should make friends with important people from other kingdoms â€“ even his enemies' kingdoms.

By following all this, your city will be a great and safe place for your people," Bhishma said.  "This is how a king should build his city and rule his kingdom."
