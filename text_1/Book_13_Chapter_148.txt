Once upon a time, a wise man named Narada told Krishna a story.  He said, "Great god Shiva was talking.  Suddenly, BOOM!  Loud thunder and bright lightning filled the sky.  Dark clouds poured rain. It got very dark, so dark you couldn't see which way was north, south, east, or west!  Then, the scary ghosts that usually hung around Shiva disappeared.  When the storm ended, some wise people went to the sacred river, and others went home. They were amazed by what they had seen!"

Narada continued, "Shiva's wife, Parvati, was there too.  Shiva even used his magic to make a mountain burn!  This showed everyone how powerful he was.  You, Krishna, are just as powerful!"

The wise people then told Krishna, "You are amazing, Krishna! We love seeing you. You make us happier than anything! Everything Shiva said about you is true.  We told you this story because we wanted to please you. You already know everything anyway! You know the secrets of the whole world. We just get so excited, we had to tell you what we saw!"  They bowed to Krishna and went home.

Krishna’s wife, Rukmini, had a baby boy! This boy was very brave and good. He was like ‘Desire’—that feeling everyone has inside that wants things. This baby boy was Krishna himself.

Bhishma, another wise man, then told Yudhishthira (a king) about Krishna.  He said, "Krishna is super strong! He helped you win your battles.  He’s like the sun, the moon, and the stars, all rolled into one!  He's been around forever, and he’ll always be around. He’s friends with the Pandavas (Yudhishthira’s family)." Bhishma explained that Krishna was the reason Yudhishthira won, like a special magic ladle helping him win a big cooking competition!  He said that even powerful people like Duryodhana (Yudhishthira’s enemy) couldn't beat Krishna.  Arjuna, Yudhishthira’s brother, is amazing too, but even he isn’t as powerful as Krishna.

Bhishma said, “Don’t be sad about the war, Yudhishthira.  Time is powerful, and it’s Time that really defeated your enemies. Krishna is like Time itself, and Time wins over everyone."

Bhishma also talked about how Krishna and Arjuna practiced being good and strong for a very, very long time. Then, he reminded Yudhishthira that being a good and fair king is very important.  He also said that remembering and sharing the stories of powerful gods, like Krishna and Shiva, brings good luck.  Everyone listened carefully, feeling happy and amazed.
