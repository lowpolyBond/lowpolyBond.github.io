King Yudhishthira listened to wise Uluka's advice.  He got his army ready!  It was HUGE!  Dhrishtadyumna, a super strong warrior, was in charge.  The army had soldiers on foot, elephants, chariots, and horses.  It was so big and strong, it looked like a calm ocean!  Arjuna and Bhima, two super brave Pandava brothers, protected it.

Dhrishtadyumna wanted to fight Drona, a powerful warrior on the other side. He carefully chose who would fight whom. He was a really smart planner!

He decided:

* Arjuna would fight Karna.
* Bhima would fight Duryodhana.
* Dhrishtaketu would fight Salya.
* Uttamaujas would fight Kripa.
* Nakula would fight Kritavarman.
* Yuyudhana would fight Jayadratha.
* Sikhandin would fight Bhishma.
* Sahadeva would fight Sakuni.
* Chekitana would fight Sala.
* Draupadi's five sons would fight the Trigartas.
* Abhimanyu, who was even better than Arjuna, would fight Vrishasena and many other kings!

Dhrishtadyumna, brave and strong as fire, saved Drona to fight himself.  He had arranged his army perfectly.  He stood ready, brave and calm, to win the battle for the Pandavas. He was ready to win!
