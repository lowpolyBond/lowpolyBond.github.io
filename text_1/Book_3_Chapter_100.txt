King Yudhishthira wanted to hear a story about a very wise and powerful magical man named Agastya.  Lomasa, a storyteller, happily agreed.

"Long ago," Lomasa began, "in a time called the Krita age, there were some very mean and strong giants called Kalakeyas.  They were led by a scary giant named Vritra. They fought against the gods, led by Indra!

The gods were scared! They went to Brahma, the creator god, for help. Brahma said, "There's a very good Rishi (a wise man) named Dadhicha.  Ask him for a special favor.  He will give you his bones!"

The gods went to Dadhicha.  They asked for his bones. Dadhicha was so good, he happily gave them his bones!  They wanted to make a super strong weapon to defeat Vritra.

The gods took the bones to Twashtri, the best craftsman in the world.  Twashri made a super powerful weapon from Dadhicha's bones, called the Vajra.  It was a shiny, six-sided hammer that made a scary rumble!

Indra, the king of the gods, took the Vajra. He used it to defeat Vritra and the Kalakeyas, saving the gods!  He ruled happily ever after."
