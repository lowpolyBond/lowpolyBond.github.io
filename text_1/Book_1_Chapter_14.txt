Once upon a time, there was a very good man named Jaratkaru. He wanted to get married, but he couldn't find a wife.  He went into the forest and prayed very hard for a wife.

Suddenly, a giant snake named Vasuki popped up! Vasuki offered his sister to Jaratkaru.  But Jaratkaru was shy. He only wanted to marry someone with the same name as him!

"What's your sister's name?" Jaratkaru asked Vasuki.

Vasuki smiled.  "Her name is Jaratkaru!" he said. "I saved her for you!"

Jaratkaru was so happy! He married Vasuki's sister. They had a big wedding, and everyone was very pleased.  And that's how Jaratkaru found his perfect wife!
