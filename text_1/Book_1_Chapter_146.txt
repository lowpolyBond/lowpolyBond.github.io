Duryodhana was a very bad man. He was jealous of his cousins, the Pandavas.  He wanted them all gone!

He smiled when he heard that his uncle, King Dhritarashtra, had sent the Pandavas to Varanavata for a fun party.  He called his friend Purochana.

"Purochana," Duryodhana whispered, "this whole kingdom is ours! Help me get rid of the Pandavas."

Purochana agreed.  Duryodhana had a terrible plan.

"Go to Varanavata quickly," he said. "Build a beautiful house near the armory. But secretly, use lots of flammable things!  Use hemp, resin, oil, butter, and lac.  Mix them with a little mud so nobody notices. Hide everything well! Make the house look amazing inside, with comfortable beds and chairs."

Purochana did exactly as Duryodhana said. He built a beautiful house that looked perfectly safe.  He even treated the Pandavas very nicely when they moved in with their mother, Kunti.

When the Pandavas were sleeping soundly, Purochana planned to set the house on fire.  He hoped everyone would think it was just an accident.

Purochana quickly went to Varanavata in his fast mule cart. He followed Duryodhana's sneaky plan perfectly.  He built the house, and waited for the night.  He was ready to burn the Pandavas alive!
