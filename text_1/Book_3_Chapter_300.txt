Once upon a time, there was a brave warrior named Karna.  He was very generous and worshipped the Sun God.  He told the Sun God, "I would give you anything! My family, my friends, even myself â€“ nothing is more important than you!"

The Sun God knew Karna was strong, but he also knew Karna's enemy, Arjuna, was very powerful. The Sun God was worried about Karna.  He said, "Karna, Indra, the King of the Gods, wants your magical earrings. He will ask for them."

The Sun God explained, "If Indra asks, don't just give him the earrings! Tell him you'll give them only if he gives you a special weapon, a magic dart that never misses its target!"

"This dart will help you win battles, even against Arjuna," the Sun God said. "Indra wants you to lose, but this way, you can be strong!"

The Sun God disappeared.  The next day, Karna told the Sun God about a dream he had.  The Sun God smiled and said, "It's exactly as I told you!"

Karna, wanting the magic dart, waited patiently for Indra to come and ask for his earrings. He was ready to make his deal. He was brave and ready to fight!
