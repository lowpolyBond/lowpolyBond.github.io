Once upon a time, a very wise woman named Anasuya talked to Sita, Rama's wife.  Anasuya said a wife should always respect her husband, even if he wasn't rich or smart. But a good husband, kind and loving, is the best!

Sita agreed.  She said Rama was a wonderful husband. He loved all his wives equally, and he was kind to everyone.  Sita remembered what her own mother and Rama's mother had taught her: a woman's most important job is to take care of her husband.  She told Anasuya that good wives go to heaven!

Anasuya was so happy to hear Sita’s words.  She wanted to give Sita a gift. "I've been praying and fasting," she said, "so I can give you a special present. What do you wish for?"

Sita smiled. "You've already made me happy just by talking to me!" she said.

Anasuya insisted! She gave Sita beautiful clothes, jewellery, and special powder. "This powder will make your husband even more handsome!" she giggled.

Then Anasuya asked Sita to tell her about her wedding. Sita happily shared her story.

"My father, King Janaka, found me in a field one day. He was so happy to have a daughter!  When I grew up, he wanted to find me a good husband. He had a giant bow that nobody could lift.  Whoever could lift it, would get to marry me!"

Many kings tried and failed. Then, Rama came!  He easily lifted the bow, and it broke!  King Janaka was thrilled, but Rama wanted to ask his father, King Dasaratha, first.  After King Dasaratha agreed, Sita and Rama got married, and Sita’s sister Urmila married Rama’s brother Lakshmana.

"And ever since," Sita finished, "I've been very happy taking care of my wonderful husband, Rama."
