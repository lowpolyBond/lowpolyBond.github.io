Prince Bharata was very sad.  His father, the king, had died.  His favorite brother, Rama, had been sent away to live in the forest!  Bharata was angry with his stepmother, Queen Kaikeyi.

"What good is being king?" Bharata cried. "My father is gone, and Rama, who was like a father to me, is gone too! You sent Rama away! You hurt everyone!  You're like a dark night, bringing only sadness!"

He told Kaikeyi she was wrong.  Rama was a good and strong king. He was kind to everyone, even her.  Rama's mother, Queen Kaushalya, and his other mother, Queen Sumitra, were heartbroken.

"Rama is strong and brave," Bharata said. "He never hurt anyone.  How could you send him away?  I love Rama very much. How can I rule without him? It's like asking a baby to carry the weight of a big bull!"

Bharata explained that the oldest son always becomes king.  Rama was the oldest, and he should be king.  Sending Rama away was breaking a very old and important rule.

"You have shamed our family!" Bharata roared, like a lion.  "I will not let you do this! I will bring Rama back home!"  He promised to bring Rama back from the forest and serve him as his king.  Then Bharata would be his loyal servant.
