Once upon a time, after a lovely rain shower, the Naga snakes were very happy.  A big bird, Garuda, flew them to a magical island.  This island was a special place for sea creatures.  They landed and saw a sparkling ocean.

The island was amazing!  There was a beautiful forest with sweet-smelling flowers and juicy fruits on the trees.  Pretty houses dotted the land, and there were ponds full of lovely lotus flowers.  The air smelled wonderful, and tall trees reached way up to the sky.  Lots of birds sang happy songs, and busy bees buzzed around the flowers.  The snakes loved it!

After a while, the snakes told Garuda, "Fly us to another beautiful island, please! You must know so many wonderful places."

Garuda felt sad. He asked his mom, Vinata, "Why do I have to do what these snakes say?"

Vinata sighed. "My dear son," she said, "I lost a bet to your aunt, Kadru, because of a trick she played. Now, because of that, I'm the snakes' servant!"

Garuda felt very sorry for his mother. He asked the snakes, "How can I make you free me and my mother from being your servants?"

The snakes replied, "Bring us the Amrita, the magical drink of immortality! Then you will be free!" And that's where the story pauses.
