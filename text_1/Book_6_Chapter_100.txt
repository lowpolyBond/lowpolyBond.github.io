Once upon a time, a great battle began!  Bhishma, a strong warrior, led the Kaurava army.  He arranged his soldiers in a clever formation.  Many brave fighters like Kripa, Kritavarman, and Sakuni were with him.  Drona, Bhurisravas, and other heroes were on the right side.  On the left, Aswatthaman and others guarded the army. Duryodhana, the Kaurava king, was in the middle.  Alamvusha and Srutayush were at the back.  The Kaurava army was ready for war, shining like fire!

The Pandava army was ready too! Yudhishthira, Bhima, Nakula, and Sahadeva led the way.  Brave warriors like Dhrishtadyumna, Satyaki, and Arjuna were there.  Sikhandin, Ghatotkacha, and Abhimanyu were also ready to fight.  The Pandava army was strong and brave, ready to face any challenge!

Then, the battle began! The Kaurava army, with Bhishma at the front, charged towards the Pandavas. The Pandavas, led by Bhima, fought back!  The air filled with the sounds of trumpets, drums, and war cries.  It was a huge and noisy battle!

The ground shook from all the fighting!  Birds cried out in fear. The sun seemed dimmer, and the wind howled.  Wild animals ran and cried, knowing something terrible was happening.  Dust flew everywhere, and there was even a rain of blood and bone!  It was a truly scary and noisy battle, with the sounds of fighting mixing with the screams of wild animals.  The sky was filled with falling stars, adding to the fear. The whole battlefield trembled from all the noise and fighting. It was a terrible, terrible battle!
