Once upon a time, King Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Vyasa, "Grandpa, what foods are clean and which are dirty?  What gifts are good, and who should get them?"

Vyasa smiled. "Long ago," he said, "wise men asked the great King Manu the same questions. They wanted to know everything: what to eat, who deserves gifts, how to study, what good deeds to do, and what bad deeds to avoid."

King Manu answered, "Clean things make you feel good inside!  Quiet prayers, fasting, learning about yourself, visiting holy rivers and places, and eating special foods are all good.  Certain mountains and bathing in special water are also good."  He said, "Proud people aren't wise. If you're proud, drink hot water for three nights to make it better!"

Manu explained that being good means not taking things that aren't yours, giving gifts, studying, being kind, telling the truth, and not getting angry. But, sometimes, what seems bad can be good, and what seems good can be bad, depending on the situation.

He said some foods were not good to eat: things like ants, worms, some fish and frogs, certain birds, and meat from animals with sharp teeth. He also said not to eat food cooked by someone you don't know, or food from certain people, like those who are unkind or dishonest.  

Manu also said that good gifts go to good people who are kind and wise. Don't give gifts to people who are mean or don't know how to use them wisely. A gift to someone who doesn't deserve it is like throwing good food away.

Giving to a poor person out of kindness is good, but don't think you'll get a magical reward for it!  A truly wise person studies hard and is kind. A gift to someone who hasn't studied or is not kind isn't very helpful!  It's like giving water to a dry well that is already broken. It won't help.

Vyasa finished, "That’s what King Manu said a long time ago.  It’s important for everyone to listen to this wise advice!"
