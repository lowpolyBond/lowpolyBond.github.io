King Pandu was very brave.  After winning a big battle, he gave lots of his treasures to his family. He gave gifts to his grandmother Satyavati, his uncle Bhishma, and even to his uncle Vidura!  Everyone was very happy. Pandu’s wife, Ambalika, was especially joyful. She was so happy, she was as happy as a goddess!  King Dhritarashtra, Pandu’s brother, used some of the treasure to have huge, wonderful religious ceremonies.

Then, Pandu decided to live in the forest. He was tired of the palace.  He wanted to go hunting! Pandu, his two wives, Kunti and Madri, left their comfy beds and went to live in a beautiful, hilly forest near the Himalaya mountains. They lived among tall trees and spent their days hunting deer.  The forest animals and people thought he was a god because he was so handsome and brave.

Even though Pandu lived in the forest, Dhritarashtra still made sure he had everything he needed. He sent him lots of things to make him happy.

Meanwhile, Bhishma, a very strong and wise man, heard about a beautiful young woman.  He married her to Vidura, Pandu's clever uncle. Vidura and the woman had many children, all just as clever as their father.
