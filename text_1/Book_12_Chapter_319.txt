Once upon a time, there was a wise king who asked a very smart man named Yajnavalkya a big question about God.  Yajnavalkya had learned a lot about God from the sun!

He told the king, "The sun god gave me the power to understand the holy words of the Vedas.  It was like a fire burning inside me!  It hurt so much I jumped into a river to cool down.  But the sun told me to be brave, and soon the pain stopped.  Then, I saw all the secret wisdom of the Vedas in my mind!"

Yajnavalkya learned so much that he taught many students. He even had a disagreement with his uncle about who got to keep the gifts given for teaching the Vedas.  The king and everyone else agreed on how to share them fairly.

Then, a magical being named Viswavasu asked Yajnavalkya twenty-five tricky questions about the universe and God.  Yajnavalkya thought hard and then gave the right answers.

He explained that the universe is like a big, changing thing with a beginning and an end. But God is different; He is always there and unchanging, like a light that never goes out.

Viswavasu was amazed and thanked Yajnavalkya.  Yajnavalkya told him that to understand God, you have to understand that everything comes from Him and goes back to Him.  It's like a fish in the water; they are separate, even though they are together.

Yajnavalkya also said that the best way to learn about God is by learning and being good.  It's not just about doing ceremonies; it's about really understanding what is right.  He taught this to many people, from kings to ordinary people.

King Daivarati, who learned from Yajnavalkya, gave away all his riches to help others and spent the rest of his life searching for God.  He learned that God is everything.  He is the giver, the gift, and the receiver of the gift. He is everywhere!

Bhishma, a great warrior, shared this story and reminded everyone that true happiness comes not from riches or power, but from understanding God and living a good life. He said the best way to do that is by learning and wisdom.
