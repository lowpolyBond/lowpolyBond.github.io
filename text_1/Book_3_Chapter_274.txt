Long ago, powerful demons were hurting everyone.  They were very strong and mean!  The good gods and wise people were scared.  They went to Brahma, the creator god, for help.

"Great Brahma," they pleaded, "the ten-headed demon Ravana is too strong! He's hurting everyone!  Please save us!"

Brahma said, "Ravana can't be beaten in a normal fight. But I have a plan.  Vishnu, the powerful god, will come to Earth to defeat him."

Brahma then asked Indra, the king of the gods, "Indra, you and the other gods must be reborn on Earth! You'll have children with monkeys and bears. These children will be super strong and help Vishnu fight Ravana!"

The gods agreed.  They became the parents of mighty monkey and bear heroes! These heroes were incredibly strong. They could lift mountains and their weapons were giant trees and rocks!  They were super fast and brave. Some lived in the mountains, others in the forests.

Brahma also told a special fairy, named Manthara, what to do. Manthara was born as a hunchbacked woman.  She became very clever at making trouble and causing fights, helping to prepare the way for Vishnu's victory!  These brave monkey and bear heroes, along with Vishnu, were ready to fight the evil Ravana.
