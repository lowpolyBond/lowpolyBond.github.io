Once upon a time, during a big battle, Bhima, a strong Pandava warrior, was very tired.  Then, a giant monkey appeared! It was Hanuman, super strong and super helpful.

Hanuman hugged Bhima tightly.  Suddenly, Bhima felt strong again! He felt like the strongest person ever!  Hanuman, with happy tears in his eyes, said, "Bhima, go home and rest. Don't tell anyone you saw me here.  Important people come here, and they'll be arriving soon.  Seeing you made me so happy! You remind me of Rama, a very brave and good king.  Now, as a friend, ask me for anything!"

Hanuman offered to help Bhima defeat his enemies, the Kauravas. He could destroy their city, or even capture their leader, Duryodhana!

Bhima smiled. "Hanuman, your help is already amazing! Thank you!  Having you on our side makes us so much stronger.  Your power will help us win!"

Hanuman replied, "I will help you! I'll go into your enemies’ army and fight bravely. When you roar like a lion in battle, I'll roar even louder to scare them! I'll even stand on Arjuna’s chariot’s flag and shout to make your enemies lose their courage.  You'll win easily!"

After showing Bhima the way, Hanuman disappeared.  He was a magical and wonderful friend!
