Once upon a time, in the land of Hastinapura, King Dhritarashtra was worried. His son, Duryodhana, was being very mean. He was planning a big fight against his cousins, the Pandavas.

Dhritarashtra was sad. He asked his wise advisor, Vidura, to bring his wife, Gandhari.  "Gandhari is very smart," said the king. "Maybe she can talk some sense into Duryodhana."

Vidura quickly brought Gandhari.  Dhritarashtra told her, "Our son is being very naughty! He's about to start a terrible war, and he might even lose his life!"

Gandhari was upset. She said, "My son, Duryodhana, is greedy. He wants all the kingdom for himself. Father, you are also to blame for letting him get away with it! You should have stopped him long ago!  He is blinded by anger and wanting things, and he won't listen to anyone. But fighting is not the answer. We can solve this by talking and sharing!"

Then, Dhritarashtra sent someone to bring Duryodhana to the court. Duryodhana stormed in, angry and red-faced, like a grumpy snake.

Gandhari looked at her son and said, "Duryodhana, my dear son, listen to me. Please make peace with your cousins. Your father, Bhishma, Drona, Kripa, and many others have told you to stop this.  Being king isn’t just about having power; it’s about being fair and kind.  You can’t just grab everything you want.  You need to control your anger and greed.  If you fight, you might lose everything. Listen to your wise friends.  They all said to share the kingdom. Even half is enough for you and your friends."

"The Pandavas are strong warriors. Don’t fight them! They are your cousins, you should be friends.  If you listen to your wise advisors and make peace, everyone will be happy.  Being a king means being wise and controlling yourself, not being greedy or angry! Please, my son, stop this war before it’s too late."
