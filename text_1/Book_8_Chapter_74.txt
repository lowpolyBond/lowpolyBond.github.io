Arjuna felt worried, but then Krishna, his friend, spoke to him.  Krishna made Arjuna feel brave and strong.

Arjuna smiled. He picked up his powerful bow, Gandiva.  He aimed it at Karna, his enemy.  "With you by my side, Krishna," Arjuna said, "I can win! I can defeat anyone, even Karna!"

Arjuna saw the enemy army running away. He saw Karna fighting bravely, using powerful weapons.  "This battle," Arjuna said, "is the one where I will defeat Karna! Everyone will remember this day!"

Arjuna promised Krishna he would defeat Karna. He would use his special arrows to stop Karna from fighting.  Arjuna said Karna’s actions would make King Dhritarashtra, Karna’s supporter, very sad. Dhritarashtra would lose everything – his kingdom, his happiness, and even his sons.  Duryodhana, Dhritarashtra’s son, would also lose everything.

Arjuna vowed to avenge the insults Karna had given him and his brothers. Karna had once boasted he wouldn't wash his feet until he defeated Arjuna. Arjuna would prove Karna wrong. He would make Karna's cruel words come back to haunt him.

Arjuna said he would defeat Karna as easily as Indra, the king of the gods, had defeated the demon Vritra long ago.  He would show everyone he was the greatest warrior.  He would protect his brothers, his friends and his kingdom.

Arjuna's eyes burned with anger. He raced into battle to help his brother Bhima and to defeat Karna. He was ready to fight!
