Once upon a time, there was a HUGE tree named Salmali.  It was so big, elephants rested in its shade!  It had lots of leaves, flowers, and fruits.  Birds lived in its branches.  Even travelers stopped to rest under it.

One day, a wise man named Narada came along.  He was amazed by the tree.  "You're so beautiful!" he said. "All these animals and birds love you.  The wind never seems to break your branches.  Is the wind your friend?"

Narada knew the wind, Pavana, was very strong.  He could even uproot big trees and mountains!  He wondered why Salmali was safe.

Salmali, being a bit boastful, thought, "Of course the wind is my friend! I'm too big and strong for him to bother!"

Narada smiled. He didn't say anything, but he knew Salmali was being a little too proud.  He left the tree, knowing that trouble might come.


And guess what?  Soon, a very strong wind came.  It was Pavana! He was angry that Salmali had boasted.  Pavana blew and blew, and he broke Salmali's branches.  The beautiful tree was damaged.

This story teaches us that even if we are strong, we shouldn't boast. It's important to be humble and kind.  Being proud can get you into trouble!
