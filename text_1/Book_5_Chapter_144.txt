Long ago, in a land far away, there was a big fight almost ready to happen.  Krishna, a very good friend of the Pandavas (five brothers), tried to make peace with the Kauravas (their cousins), but they wouldn't listen.

Vidura, a wise man, was very sad. He told Kunti, the mother of the Pandavas, "Mother,  the Kauravas are being mean.  They won't listen to reason.  The Pandavas have many friends and are strong, but they only want what is right.  The Kauravas are proud and mean, and this will lead to a terrible war!"  Vidura was so worried he couldn't sleep.

Kunti, hearing this, felt terrible too. She thought, "All this fighting is because of greed!  Friends will fight each other.  It’s awful! But if we don't fight, we'll be poor and ashamed. Even death is better than that. But killing family… that's the worst kind of loss!"

Kunti worried about many things.  Bhishma, Drona (their teacher), and even Karna, who was very powerful, were fighting on the Kauravas' side. She thought, "Drona won't want to fight his students. Bhishma should love the Pandavas. It’s only Karna, who's been tricked by Duryodhana, the meanest Kaurava, who hates the Pandavas so much."

Kunti had a secret. A long time ago, a magical man gave her a special wish.  She used it to have a son, Karna!  She decided to talk to him.  She found Karna praying by the river Ganga.  The sun was hot, and Kunti stood in his shadow, feeling weak.

Karna saw his mother and was very surprised. He greeted her with respect.  Kunti was about to tell him her secret, and the story continues…
