King Dasaratha was very happy.  The people wanted his son, Rama, to be the next in charge of the kingdom!

The king told the wise men, Vasishtha and Vamadeva, "Let's make Rama the prince! Let's do it this month when the trees are blooming."

Everyone cheered!  Then, King Dasaratha asked Vasishtha, "Wise one, please tell us what we need for the ceremony."

Vasishtha told the helpers to get lots of things: gold, jewels, nice-smelling oils, flower garlands, rice, honey, butter, new clothes, chariots, weapons, elephants, flags, and a beautiful canopy.  He also said, "We need enough food to feed one hundred thousand holy men! We need to give them enough money so they never need to worry about being hungry again."

Vasishtha said the palace needed to be decorated.  Flowers everywhere!  Sweet smells!  Singing girls at the gates!  Food and drinks at every corner!  He wanted everything perfect.

Vasishtha and Vamadeva made sure everything was ready.  Then King Dasaratha said, "Bring Prince Rama!"

Sumantra brought Rama in a grand chariot.  Many kings came to see Rama become prince.  King Dasaratha was so proud! Rama was handsome, brave, and kind.  He was like the moon!

Rama bowed to his father. King Dasaratha hugged him and put him on a beautiful golden throne.  Rama looked like the sun!

King Dasaratha was so happy. He said to Rama, "My dear son, you are kind and good.  Be a fair ruler.  Always listen to your people.  Try to make everyone happy."

Rama said, "Yes, Father."

Queen Kaushalya, Rama's mother, was overjoyed. She gave gifts to everyone who brought her the good news.

Rama left the palace in his chariot.  The people cheered! They prayed that everything would go well for Rama. Everyone was excited for Rama to be prince!
