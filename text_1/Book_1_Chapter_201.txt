King Drupada was happy.  He wasn't scared anymore, not even of the gods!  His family welcomed Kunti, Yudhishthira's mother. They bowed down and greeted her.  Krishna, Yudhishthira's new wife, wore a beautiful red dress. She was happy and greeted Kunti politely.

Kunti loved Krishna. She gave her a wonderful blessing.  She wished Krishna would be a great wife, like all the amazing wives in stories! She wished Krishna would have strong, healthy children and be very happy. Kunti hoped Krishna would be a kind queen, always welcoming guests and taking care of everyone.  She also wished Krishna would one day give away lots of land to good people.  Kunti was so happy to see her beautiful new daughter-in-law.

After the wedding, Krishna's brother, Krishna (yes, both were named Krishna!), gave Yudhishthira and his brothers amazing gifts!  He sent them sparkly gold jewelry, fancy clothes from faraway lands, soft blankets, and comfy beds.  He even sent hundreds of beautiful dishes, thousands of servants, many strong elephants, fast horses, and lots and lots of gold coins!  Yudhishthira was very happy with all the presents.
