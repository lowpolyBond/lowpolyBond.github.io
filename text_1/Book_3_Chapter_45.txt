Once upon a time, in the land of gods and heroes, there was a great warrior named Arjuna.  He was so strong and brave!  The god Indra knew Arjuna liked a beautiful fairy named Urvasi.

Indra wanted Arjuna to learn more about… well, girls! So he sent a messenger, a king of fairies called Chitrasena, to Urvasi.  Indra told Chitrasena, "Go tell Urvasi to spend time with Arjuna.  He’s already learned how to fight, now he needs to learn how to be kind and friendly with ladies."

Chitrasena flew to Urvasi. She was very happy to see him. Chitrasena explained everything Indra had said. He told Urvasi about Arjuna, how strong and kind he was, how he knew everything about fighting and even about gods and books. He said Indra wanted Urvasi to be nice to Arjuna.

Urvasi smiled.  She had heard about Arjuna's goodness and bravery.  She thought, "Arjuna is a wonderful hero! I’d love to be friends with him!” She agreed to be nice to Arjuna.

So Chitrasena flew back to Indra, and everything worked out. Arjuna and Urvasi became friends, just like Indra had wished.  And Arjuna learned something new!
