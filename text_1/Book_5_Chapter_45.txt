Once upon a time, a wise teacher named Sanat-sujata talked to a king. He said, "King, there are bad things that hurt people.  These are like sneaky traps!  They are: sadness, anger, wanting too much, wanting things you shouldn't, being silly, being lazy, being mean, thinking you're better than others, always wanting more, loving things too much, being jealous, and saying bad things.  These make people do bad things.

Some bad people are greedy, angry, mean with words, talk too much, hold onto anger, and brag.  If they get rich, they’re still mean. Other bad people only care about fun, think too highly of themselves, brag about gifts, never share, are weak, love themselves too much, and hate their wives.

But there are good things too! Good things are like magic!  They are: being fair, telling the truth, being quiet and calm, controlling yourself, being happy with what you have, being humble, letting go of things, loving others, giving gifts, knowing stories from the wise books, being patient, and forgiving others.  If you do these things, you can be a great king! Even doing just one good thing helps.  Being calm, letting go of things, and being smart are the best ways to be happy forever.

It's bad to talk about others, even if it's true.  Being bossy is even worse! It has many bad parts like being mean, stopping good things, gossiping, lying, being angry, relying on others, talking bad about others, searching for problems to tell on others, wasting money, fighting, being rude, being cruel, being jealous, being dumb, ignoring important people, not knowing right from wrong, and always trying to hurt others.  So don't be bossy!

True friends are special. They're happy when you're happy, and sad when you're sad.  A good friend will give you anything important, even their best things. But a good friend will also work hard for their own things, and not always take from others.  A good friend will help you even if it hurts them.

A rich person can be good by being kind and doing good things.  They should also try to control their feelings.  This is being good.  It can help you be happy in heaven!  Being good is even better than being super smart!  The best way to be really good is to think deeply about life and be peaceful, without getting angry or sad. You don’t even need to do extra things. Just be good and peaceful.  This is the real truth and is more important than anything else. Only by being peaceful and good can you truly live forever."
