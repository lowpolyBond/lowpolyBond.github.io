Long ago, in a kingdom far away, King Dasaratha died.  He had sent his oldest son, Rama, and his brother Lakshmana, to live in the forest for fourteen years.

The king's helpers went to Bharata, Rama's younger brother. They said, "Bharata, you are our new king!  The kingdom needs a ruler.  Everything is ready for your coronation!"

Bharata, who was a very good and honest prince, shook his head.  "No," he said. "Rama is the oldest. He should be king.  It's not right for me to take his place."

Bharata made a big decision. He said, "I'm going to the forest! I will find Rama and Lakshmana. I will bring them back, and Rama will be our king.  I will never let Queen Kaikeyi's wish to keep Rama away from the throne come true!"

He ordered his army to get ready. He wanted to make the journey to the forest easier. "Fix the roads!" he commanded. "Make them smooth for us!"

The people were so happy to hear Bharata's words. They cheered and cried happy tears.  They said, "Prince Bharata, we want Rama to be our king!  You are a good prince!"

Everyone was overjoyed. The helpers said, "We'll get workers to fix the roads right away, my Prince!" Bharata's kindness made everyone happy, and they all got ready to bring Rama home.
