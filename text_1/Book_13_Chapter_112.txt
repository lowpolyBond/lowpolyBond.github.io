Yudhishthira asked, "I know what happens to bad people, but what happens to good people? How can someone do good things and have a happy life, here and in heaven?"

Vrihaspati answered, "Doing bad things makes you go to a bad place.  But if you're sorry for what you did and think about being good, it's better.  Telling a wise person about your mistakes helps too. It’s like a snake shedding its old, sick skin!"

"Giving gifts to wise people is very good. The best gift is food!  Food is life.  Everything needs food to live. Gods, wise people, and everyone needs it. King Rantideva went to heaven because he gave away lots of food.  Give good food you got honestly to wise people who know the scriptures.  If a thousand wise people eat your food, you won’t be reborn again and again.  Feeding ten thousand is even better!"

"A warrior who protects his people and gives food to wise people does good things. A farmer who shares his food, and even a worker who shares their hard-earned food, does good things too!  Giving food is the best way to be good and avoid bad things."

"Giving food is like giving life! It’s the most important good thing you can do. You’ll never go to a bad place if you do that.  Always give food first before you eat, and make every day count by sharing food. Feeding a thousand wise people means you’ll be happy forever in heaven, rich, beautiful, and famous!"

"Giving food is the most important good thing, the root of all goodness!"
