Once upon a time, in a grand gathering of gods and wise men, King Indra asked Lord Vishnu, "How can people please you, Lord?"

Vishnu smiled.  "I hate it when people are mean to Brahmins (wise priests)," he said. "If you treat Brahmins with kindness and respect, you please me.  Showing respect to your own feet at night also pleases me.  And you know what else?  I’m happy when you worship the little swirl in fresh cow dung.  Seeing a small Brahmin, or a mud-covered boar that just came out of the water, brings good luck.  Worshiping a banyan tree, a special yellow powder (gorochana), and cows is like worshipping the whole universe!"

Indra was curious. "Why are you pleased by cow dung swirls, feet, a boar, and a small Brahmin?" he asked.

Vishnu chuckled. "My spinning disc defeated the bad guys! My feet support the whole world! As a boar, I saved the earth! As a small man, I won a great battle!  People who worship me in these ways are very happy."

Vishnu also said that sharing your food with a Brahmin guest and facing the sunrise brings good luck.

Then, Baladeva shared another secret:  Touching a cow, ghee (clarified butter), yogurt, and mustard seeds in the morning washes away bad things.

The gods added that using a copper bowl for prayers and offerings brings good luck, too.

Dharma explained that you shouldn’t give offerings to certain Brahmins – those who work for the king, ring bells in temples, trade, or are unkind.

Agni (the god of fire) warned against kicking cows, Brahmins, or fire! It’s very bad luck.

Viswamitra shared another secret:  Offering rice cooked in sweet milk at noon in the shade of an elephant in a certain month and under a specific star brings amazing good luck.

The cows themselves said that praising a cow with special words brings happiness and gets rid of all sins.

Finally, the wise men asked how people without money can still be good and holy.  Brahma, the creator, explained that even without big ceremonies, sleeping under the night sky on a certain night, with faith, brings the same good luck as doing huge sacrifices.


And that's how the gods and wise men shared their secrets about being happy and good!
