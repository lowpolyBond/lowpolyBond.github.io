Duryodhana, the Kaurava prince, boasted, "The Pandavas are just ordinary men!  They're not special. Why should they win? We are just as strong, smart, and skilled as they are!  Karna, Dussasana, and I will defeat them in battle! Then we'll have big celebrations and give away lots of gifts!" He imagined capturing the Pandavas like hunters catching deer.  He thought even Krishna, the Pandavas' friend, would be defeated.

Vidura, a wise man, shook his head.  "Self-control is very important," he said.  "It's especially important for good people.  People who control themselves are kind, honest, and peaceful. They don't get angry or greedy. They are brave but not bullies.  They are friends to everyone."

Vidura explained that people who are self-controlled are calm and happy. They don't worry about others, and others don't worry about them. They live peaceful lives and are always cheerful. Some even leave the world behind to find peace and become one with the divine.  Their path to peace is hard to see, like a bird's trail in the sky, but it leads to a wonderful place.
