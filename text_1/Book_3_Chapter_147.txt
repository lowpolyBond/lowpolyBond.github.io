Once upon a time, Prince Rama's wife, Sita, was kidnapped!  Rama and his brother searched everywhere.  High up on a mountain, they met Sugriva, a monkey king.  They became friends. Rama helped Sugriva become king.

Then, Sugriva sent thousands of monkeys to find Sita.  I, Hanuman, the strongest monkey, went too! We searched and searched.  A giant vulture told us Sita was with the evil king Ravana in Lanka.

I flew across a huge ocean!  It was so wide, it took me a long, long time to cross. I found Sita in Ravana's palace.  She was sad but safe. Then, I set Lanka on fire!  I showed everyone I was there!

Rama built a bridge across the ocean with the help of the monkeys.  He and his army fought Ravana's monsters.  They won! Rama defeated Ravana and rescued Sita.  He made Vibhishana, a good Rakshasa, the new king of Lanka.

Rama and Sita went home to Ayodhya. Rama was a good king. I asked Rama for a wish:  "Let me live as long as people remember your amazing story!" Rama said, "So be it!"

Rama ruled for a very, very long time. Then he went to live with the gods.  Even now, angels sing songs about his bravery. This path you’re trying to take, Bhima, is for gods only.  I stopped you because it’s too dangerous. But the lake you're looking for is that way.
