Once upon a time, King Dhritarashtra, who was blind, decided to leave his palace and go live in the forest.  He chose a special day, a full moon night.

First, he said goodbye to his nephews, the Pandava princes.  They were very sad. He asked wise priests to say special prayers.  Then he changed his fancy clothes for simple forest clothes â€“ deer skin and bark.  He took his wife, Queen Gandhari, with him.

His daughters-in-law and many other women cried loudly.  It was very sad.  Dhritarashtra gave gifts to all his servants. He even offered special gifts to his house before leaving.

Yudhishthira, the oldest Pandava, was so upset he fainted!  Arjuna, his brave brother, felt terrible too.  Many other people were sad, too. Vidura, Kripa, and many other important people walked with Dhritarashtra, their voices filled with sadness.

Queen Kunti walked with Gandhari, holding her hand.  Gandhari was blind and walked with her hand on her husband's shoulder.  Many other women from the royal family went with them, too.  They cried so much it sounded like a flock of sad birds.

Even the wives of the regular people from the city came out to say goodbye.  They felt just as sad as they did when the Pandavas left for the forest a long time ago.  Even women who hardly ever left their houses came out to cry.  Everyone was very, very sad to see Dhritarashtra go.
