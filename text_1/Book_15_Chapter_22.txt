The Pandava brothers were very, very sad.  Their mother Kunti was gone to live in the forest.  They stopped doing their kingly jobs. They didn't talk to anyone.  They were so sad they couldn't even think straight.

They worried about their blind grandfather, King Dhritarashtra, and their grandmother, Queen Gandhari.  They lived alone in the forest with wild animals!  The Pandavas missed their mother terribly.  They wondered how she was managing in the forest. She was used to living in a beautiful palace!

Sahadeva said, "Brothers, we must see our mother and grandfather!"  He explained that he hadn't spoken sooner because he respected their sadness.  He described how his mother was living a very hard life, sleeping on grass, and doing hard things to be closer to God. He said, "It's not fair! She’s a princess, and now she’s suffering!"

Draupadi, their wife, added, "I must see Kunti and Gandhari too!  It will make my life worthwhile."

King Yudhishthira, the oldest Pandava brother, agreed. He called his army. He ordered many things:

*  Lots of carriages and elephants to carry them.
*  Closed palanquins for the queens.
*  Food, tents, and everything needed for a long journey.
*  Any citizen who wanted to come along was welcome.

The next morning, King Yudhishthira, his brothers, and their family set off. They waited five days for people to join them before starting their journey to the forest. They were going to see their loved ones!
