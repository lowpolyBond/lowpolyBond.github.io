King Dhritarashtra was watching the great battle. He asked his advisor, Sanjaya, "Sanjaya, tell me everything! How did Abhimanyu, Arjuna's brave son, fight?  How did he fight Alamvusha, the son of Rishyasringa? Tell me about Bhima, Ghatotkacha, Nakula, Sahadeva, Satyaki, and Arjuna – what did they do?"

Sanjaya said, "I will tell you, my king! Abhimanyu and Alamvusha fought fiercely. They were like a god and a demon! Alamvusha shouted, 'Wait!' and charged. Abhimanyu roared like a lion and charged back! They hit each other with lots of arrows. Abhimanyu shot three, then five arrows. Alamvusha shot back with nine! Alamvusha was really strong. He shot a thousand arrows at Abhimanyu! Abhimanyu, angry, shot nine arrows right into Alamvusha's chest. Alamvusha was hurt, but he was still strong. He was covered in arrows, but he looked like a mountain on fire!

Alamvusha used magic to make it very dark. No one could see anything! But Abhimanyu used a magical weapon to make it light again. Then he shot many more arrows at Alamvusha. Alamvusha tried more magic tricks, but Abhimanyu was too clever!  Alamvusha was scared and ran away!

Then Abhimanyu fought many other warriors.  Bhishma, the leader of the Kaurava army, saw his soldiers losing. He and many other warriors attacked Abhimanyu together.  Abhimanyu was very brave, just like his father and uncle!

Then Arjuna, Abhimanyu's father, came to help!  He fought Bhishma.  Arjuna’s side and Dhritarashtra’s side fought hard.  Kripa, a warrior from Dhritarashtra's side, shot Arjuna. Satyaki, a friend of the Pandavas, saw this and attacked Kripa. Aswatthama, Drona’s son, fought Satyaki. They exchanged many arrows!  Aswatthama even broke Satyaki’s bow! But Satyaki got another bow and fought back hard.  Then Drona, the teacher of both sides, joined the fight to save his son.  Arjuna and Drona fought fiercely. It was a huge battle!"
