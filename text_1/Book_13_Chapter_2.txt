King Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather Bhishma, "Grandpa, tell me a story about someone who beat Death by being good!"

Bhishma said, "Long ago, there was a king named Dasaswa.  He had a good son, Madiraswa, who also had a good son, Dyutimat.  Dyutimat had a son named Suvira, who was very rich and kind. Suvira had a brave son named Sudurjaya, who had a son named Duryodhana.  King Duryodhana was a great and fair ruler. His kingdom was rich and happy, with no poor or sick people."

"King Duryodhana had a beautiful daughter, Sudarsana. The fire god, Agni, wanted to marry her. But Duryodhana refused because Agni looked like a poor man.  Agni was angry and left!  Duryodhana was sad and asked the wise men for help. Agni reappeared and said he wanted to marry Sudarsana!  Duryodhana happily agreed, asking Agni to stay in his kingdom forever.  And Agni did!"

"Sudarsana and Agni had a son, also named Sudarsana.  This Sudarsana married Oghavati, the daughter of King Oghavat.  Sudarsana made a promise: he would beat Death by always being kind to guests."

"One day, Sudarsana went to collect wood.  A holy man came to Oghavati and asked for hospitality.  He said he only wanted Oghavati herself!  Oghavati remembered Sudarsana's promise. Feeling shy, she agreed."

"Sudarsana came home and called for Oghavati.  The holy man told Sudarsana what happened. Sudarsana wasn't angry! He said, 'It's my duty to be kind to guests. My wife, my home, everything is for them!'  Death, who was watching, was surprised by Sudarsana's kindness."

"Then the holy man said, 'I am Dharma, the god of righteousness! I tested you, and you passed! You have beaten Death!'  Oghavati became a river, and Sudarsana went to heaven."

Bhishma finished, "This story shows that being kind to guests is very important.  It's even more important than doing many good deeds. If you're kind, you'll be happy and live a long life!"
