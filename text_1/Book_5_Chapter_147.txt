Once upon a time, after a long talk with the Pandava brothers, Krishna went to his room to rest.  The Pandavas, after saying their evening prayers, talked about what happened at the meeting in the city of Nagapura.

Yudhishthira asked Krishna, "Krishna, tell us everything you said to Duryodhana in Nagapura."

Krishna said, "I spoke truthfully and wisely, but Duryodhana wouldn't listen."

Yudhishthira wanted to know more. He asked, "What did Grandpa Bhishma say? What did their teacher say? What did Duryodhana's parents, Dhritarashtra and Gandhari, say?  What did Vidura, their uncle, say? What did all the other kings say?  I forgot some of what you told us, Krishna. Please tell us again!"

Krishna said, "Okay, I'll tell you what happened.  After I spoke, Duryodhana laughed! Bhishma got angry and said, 'Duryodhana, listen to me!  I'm saying this to save our family.  Share the kingdom with your cousins! My father wanted another son, so I made a difficult promise to have one. Because of that promise, I gave up the throne. My brother Vichitravirya became king, but he died. The kingdom was in trouble and people asked *me* to be king.  My mother, my servants, and wise people begged me to rule. But I kept my promise.  Then, I asked the wise Vyasa to help my brother's wives have sons.  That's how your father, Pandu, became king.  His sons, the Pandavas, should get their share of the kingdom!  Don't fight. Share the kingdom peacefully!  My father, Gandhari, and Vidura all agree with me. Listen to us older people! Don't ruin everything!'"
