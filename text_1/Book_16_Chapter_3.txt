Once upon a time, in the city of Dwarka, strange things started happening. The women of the Yadava clan had scary dreams. They dreamed of a dark woman with white teeth laughing and running through the city, stealing their lucky bracelets. The men dreamed of huge vultures eating them alive!  Their beautiful things – jewelry, royal umbrellas, flags, and armor – disappeared, stolen by scary monsters called Rakshasas.

Even more strangely, Krishna's magic discus, a gift from the fire god, flew up into the sky!  And Vasudeva's amazing chariot, shining like the sun, was pulled away by its four super-fast horses – Saivya, Sugriva, Meghapushpa, and Valahaka – right into the ocean!  Even the special flags on Krishna and Vasudeva’s chariots were taken by magical beings called Apsaras.  These Apsaras kept telling everyone to go on a special trip to a holy place.


These scary events made the Yadavas very worried.  They decided to go on a pilgrimage, a long journey to a holy place by the sea. They packed lots of yummy food and drinks, and rode away in their chariots and on their elephants. They went to Prabhasa, a place near the ocean, and settled down with all their families.

A wise man named Uddhava came to visit, but he was leaving forever.  Krishna knew that something bad was going to happen to his people. He let Uddhava go.

The Yadavas started a big party! They mixed their special food with wine and even gave it to monkeys! They drank a lot of wine and danced and celebrated. But then, things got out of control.

Two brave Yadavas, Yuyudhana and Kritavarma, started arguing.  Yuyudhana made fun of Kritavarma.  Kritavarma got angry and reminded Yuyudhana how he had hurt someone in the past.

Satyaki, another brave Yadava, jumped in and defended Yuyudhana.  He got so angry at Kritavarma that he killed him right then and there!  

Then, everyone started fighting!  They were all drunk, and they fought with whatever they could find.  They even used blades of grass!  It was like a magical curse; each blade of grass turned into a sharp iron weapon!  Fathers fought sons, and sons fought fathers. It was a terrible, terrible battle.

Krishna, heartbroken and angry, used a blade of grass as a weapon, too.  He sadly stopped the fight, but not before many, many people were dead – even Krishna's own son and Satyaki!

Only a few survived this terrible day.  Krishna was left feeling very sad and alone.  The once-great Yadava clan was gone.
