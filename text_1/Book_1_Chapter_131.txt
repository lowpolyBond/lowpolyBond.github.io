Once upon a time, there were two groups of cousins: the Pandavas and the Kauravas.  They were princes!  Their grandfather, Bhishma, wanted them to be strong and brave warriors.  He needed a super-duper teacher.

Bhishma looked everywhere for the best teacher. He wanted someone really smart, strong, and amazing at fighting. Finally, he found him! His name was Drona.  Drona was the son of a great sage, Bharadwaja.

But how was Drona born?  Well, Bharadwaja, a very holy man, was once by the river Ganga. He saw a beautiful fairy, Ghritachi.  He was so amazed, that some of his special energy went into a jar.  And guess what?  Drona popped out of the jar!  Isn't that amazing?

Drona learned everything! He learned all the magic fighting skills.  He even learned from another amazing warrior named Rama.  Rama gave Drona all his special weapons and showed him how to use them!

Drona had a friend named Drupada.  When Drona grew up, he became the teacher of the Pandavas and Kauravas. He taught them how to fight with swords, spears, bows and arrows, and all sorts of cool weapons. The cousins became super strong warriors in no time!  They learned all these skills from their amazing teacher.  And Drona, the great teacher, had a son named Ashwatthaman, who also became a very strong warrior.  He was so strong, when he cried as a baby, it sounded like a horse!  

Thatâ€™s the story of Drona, the amazing teacher, and how he became so skilled!
