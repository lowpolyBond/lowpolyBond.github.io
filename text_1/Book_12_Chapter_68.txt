Once upon a time, a wise king named Vasumanas lived in Kosala.  He wondered why people called a king a god.  He asked the super-smart sage, Vrihaspati, all about it.

Vasumanas bowed respectfully and asked, "Sage, how do people become strong, and how do they get hurt?  How can they be happy forever?"

Vrihaspati smiled. "Everything depends on the king," he said. "The king keeps everyone safe.  Without a king, people would fight and steal from each other. Imagine a world without rules! The strong would bully the weak, and no one would be safe.  People wouldn't even be able to say, 'This is mine!' There would be no families, no food, nothing good.

It's like a school of fish without a leader," Vrihaspati continued. "They'd fight and eat each other until there were none left!  Or like a herd of cows without a shepherd – they'd get lost and scared. The king protects everyone, like a shepherd protects his sheep.  He keeps the peace, makes sure everyone is fair, and keeps bad people away."

"The king is like the sun and the moon," Vrihaspati explained. "Without them, it would be dark and scary. Without a king, everything would fall apart.  There would be no farming, no trading, no weddings.  Even cows wouldn't give milk! The king keeps things safe and makes everyone happy."

"The king is also like many gods," he said. "He’s like fire when he punishes bad people, like the sun when he watches over everyone, and like death when he stops bad people from hurting others.  He’s like a generous king who helps those who are good and punishes those who are bad. He keeps everyone safe, and that's why he is so important.  He's like a god because he protects everyone from harm."

"So," Vrihaspati concluded, "always respect the king. He keeps you safe and helps you have a good life."  King Vasumanas understood and became a much better king, protecting his people with kindness and wisdom.
