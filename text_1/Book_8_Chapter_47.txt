King Dhritarashtra was watching the big battle. He asked his friend Sanjaya, "Sanjaya, tell me everything!  How are Arjuna and Karna fighting?"

Sanjaya said, "Arjuna's army was huge!  It had lots of soldiers, horses, elephants, and chariots.  Arjuna, shining bright like the sun, was ready to fight.  His nephews, the sons of Draupadi, fought bravely beside him. They were strong like tigers!"

"Arjuna was angry! He saw the Samsaptakas and attacked them with his powerful bow, Gandiva.  The Samsaptakas wanted to defeat Arjuna, but Arjuna was too strong. He was like a whirlwind!  He destroyed chariots, horses, elephants, and soldiers. He fought like a superhero!"

"Meanwhile, on the other side, Karna was fighting with the Pandavas.  He had lots of friends helping him, including Duryodhana. Karna was very brave.  He fought with his sharp arrows and defeated many warriors. He even hurt Yudhishthira!"

"The battle was huge and scary!  It was like the battle between the gods and the demons a long, long time ago. Lots of soldiers were hurt, but the brave fighters fought for what they believed in."
