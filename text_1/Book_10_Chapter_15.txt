Once upon a time, during a great battle, Arjuna, a brave warrior, used a super-powerful arrow.  It was so strong, it could even stop other powerful arrows!  But then, he saw two wise holy men.  He quickly stopped his arrow.  It was very hard to do!  Only a very good and pure person could do this.  Arjuna was very good and pure, so he could.

Arjuna said, "These wise men are like gods!  We need their help!"

Ashwatthama, Drona's son, also had a super-powerful arrow flying. He couldn't stop it! He was scared and sad. He said, “I shot this arrow because I was afraid of Bhima, another warrior.  I did a bad thing, and now I can't stop it!”  His arrow was going to hurt everyone!

An old wise man, Vyasa, explained that Arjuna had only used his powerful arrow to stop Ashwatthama's.  He never wanted to hurt anyone.  He was a very honest and brave warrior.

Vyasa then talked to Ashwatthama.  "Your arrow is dangerous!"  Vyasa said, “Arjuna didn't want to fight like that.  To stop your arrow would cause a terrible drought for twelve years! Let's find a way to save everyone.”  Vyasa suggested Ashwatthama give a special magical jewel from his head. That would save everyone's lives.


Ashwatthama said, "My jewel is very precious! It protects against anything bad!  I can't give it up." But he agreed to do something else.

"I can't stop the arrow," he said. "But I will throw it into the future so it will hurt the Pandava women and children.  It will save everyone else!"

So, Ashwatthama threw the arrow into a safe place, sparing everyone else, but it later affected the Pandava women and their children.  The battle continued, but the terrible arrow's worst effects were avoided because of the wise men and Arjuna's kindness.
