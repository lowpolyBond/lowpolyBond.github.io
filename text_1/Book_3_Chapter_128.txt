Once upon a time, a king named Somaka wanted lots and lots of sons. He went to a wise priest for help.  The priest said, "I can help you, but you must do exactly what I say."

Somaka agreed. The priest performed a special ceremony.  He needed to use a baby boy, Jantu, as part of the ritual. But Jantu's mothers loved him very much! They cried and tried to save him, but the priest took Jantu and offered him as a sacrifice. The mothers were heartbroken.

Amazingly, after the ceremony, all the mothers became pregnant! Ten months later, Somaka had one hundred sons! Jantu, the baby from the ceremony, was the oldest and strongest.  He had a special golden mark on his back.

Many years later, Somaka found out the priest was in a very hot and scary hell. Somaka asked why. The priest said, "It's because of that ceremony!"

Somaka was a good king. He didn't want to leave the priest alone in hell. He told the god of justice, "I'll go to hell with him! It was my fault, too."

The god of justice said, "Everyone must face the results of their own actions. But since you want to be with the priest, you will stay in hell with him for the same amount of time he has to stay."

Somaka went to hell with the priest.  After they were both punished for their actions, they were released from hell.  Somaka learned that even good kings can make mistakes, and it's important to accept the consequences of your actions. He and the priest lived happily together afterward.  That's why this place is so special; if you spend six nights here, being good and quiet, you'll go to a happy place after you die!
