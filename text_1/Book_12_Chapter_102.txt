King Yudhishthira asked his wise uncle Bhishma, "Uncle, how can we know if our army will win a battle?"

Bhishma smiled.  "My dear boy," he said, "there are many signs!  If the priests are doing special prayers and rituals, and everything feels peaceful and happy, that's a good sign.  If the soldiers and animals are cheerful, that's good too! The wind blows kindly, rainbows appear in the sky, and even the jackals and crows seem friendly.  If the fire from the sacrifices burns brightly and smells good, that means victory is likely. Loud drums and happy soldiers are good too!"

"If deer are seen behind or to the left of your army, it is lucky," Bhishma continued. "But if they are in front, that's not a good sign.  Happy birds singing are also good omens!  A strong army that looks powerful and frightening is more likely to win.  Friendly, respectful soldiers are also a sign of success. Good feelings, helpfulness, and calmness are all important."

"A crow on the left is lucky for someone already fighting, and on the right for someone about to fight," Bhishma explained.  "But a crow in front or behind isn't good."

"Even with a big army, try to make peace first," Bhishma advised. "Winning a battle is not as good as making peace.  Sometimes, even a small group of brave soldiers can defeat a much larger army, because bravery and teamwork are powerful!"

"Before you fight, try being kind and peaceful," Bhishma said. "If that doesn't work, *then* fight. A big battle is scary and sad. It makes everyone suffer.  The whole land becomes upset and everyone feels pain."

"Use your spies to make the enemy's friends turn against them," Bhishma suggested.  "Then make peace with the stronger enemy, if you can.  Always try to surround your enemy.  Being forgiving makes you better known and respected.  But don't be too weak! Be kind but be strong. Show that you're brave but caring."

Bhishma concluded, "After a battle, even if you win, be kind to the enemy's survivors. Show that youâ€™re sad people died.  Honor your own brave soldiers, help the wounded, and show that you care about everyone. This way, everyone will trust you and you will be a good king."
