Once upon a time, the king of the gods, Indra, was talking with his friends about how to get rid of a bad king named Nahusha.  Suddenly, a wise old man named Agastya arrived.

Agastya was very happy to see Indra.  He said, "Indra, it's wonderful that you're doing so well! You defeated Nahusha, the bad king who ruled the heavens!"

Indra was happy to see Agastya too. He offered him food and drink. Then he asked Agastya, "Tell me, how did you defeat Nahusha?"

Agastya smiled and began to tell a story. "Nahusha was very proud and mean. He made the holy men carry him on their shoulders.  These holy men were very tired. They asked Nahusha, ‘King, are these prayers from the holy books real?’ Nahusha, who was very mean and stubborn, said they weren’t real! The holy men were sad. Nahusha was so mean that he even stepped on my head!"

"Because Nahusha was so disrespectful and mean, I punished him," Agastya said. "He lost all his power and beauty.  I turned him into a giant snake! He had to live on Earth for ten thousand years as a snake before he could return to heaven."

Everyone was very happy to hear this.  The gods, the spirits, even the rivers and mountains were relieved that Nahusha was gone. They all cheered, "It's wonderful that Indra is strong and good!  It's wonderful that Nahusha is gone!"  And Indra went back to rule the heavens, happy and strong.
