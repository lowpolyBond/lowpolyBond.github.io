Once upon a time, a wise man named Mandapala lived with his family near a big forest.  He had talked to the fire god, Agni, to keep his family safe. Agni promised to protect them. So Mandapala waited until it was the right time, and then he took his wife and sons to a safer place.

Now, Agni was very hungry!  He wanted to burn the Khandava forest.  Two brave heroes, Krishna and Arjuna, helped Agni do this. They were super strong and fought alongside the fire god.  The forest burned for many days.  Agni ate lots and lots of food, and felt very happy!

Indra, the king of the gods, saw how brave Krishna and Arjuna were. He was so impressed! He came down from the sky with his friends, the wind gods. Indra told Krishna and Arjuna, "You did something amazing! You can each ask for anything you want!"

Arjuna asked for Indra’s magical weapons.  Indra said, "I will give you my weapons when Krishna is happy with you.  Then you'll be very, very strong!" Krishna asked to always be friends with Arjuna.  Indra made this happen.

Agni was happy too! He had a big feast and said to Krishna and Arjuna, “You are the bravest heroes! You can go anywhere you want!”  After their big adventure, Krishna, Arjuna, and their friend Maya rested by a beautiful river.  And that's how Agni got his fill and Krishna and Arjuna got amazing powers!
