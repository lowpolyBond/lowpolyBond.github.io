Once upon a time, there was a very strong warrior named Karna.  He was learning to fight from a powerful teacher named Rama. Rama was very impressed with Karna. Karna was a hard worker and always respectful.

Rama taught Karna a special, super-powerful weapon. Karna practiced hard and became very good at using it. One day, Rama was very tired from praying and fasting. He was so tired that he fell asleep in Karna's lap!

While Rama slept, a big, scary worm crawled onto Karna's leg.  The worm bit Karna! It hurt a lot! But Karna didn't move. He didn't want to wake his teacher. He bravely endured the pain.

When Karna's blood touched Rama, Rama woke up. He saw the worm. It was actually a mean, angry spirit in disguise! The spirit was punished and turned into a worm long ago.  Rama helped the spirit go to a better place.

Rama was angry with Karna.  He asked Karna why he had pretended to be from his family.  Karna told the truth: he wasn't really from the same family as Rama.  Rama was sad, but because Karna had lied, he couldn't use the super-powerful weapon in the biggest battles.

Even though Karna couldn't use the super-weapon, he still went to see his friend, Duryodhana.  Karna told Duryodhana, "I've learned to use many weapons!"  Even without the super-weapon, Karna was still a very strong warrior.
