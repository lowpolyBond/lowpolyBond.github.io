Long ago, wise men asked Sauti, a storyteller, about a special place called Samanta-panchaka.

Sauti said, "Listen!  A long time ago, a brave warrior named Rama fought many battles. He was so angry, he defeated all the warriors of a whole kingdom!  His anger caused five big lakes of blood to form at Samanta-panchaka.  Feeling sorry, he poured the blood as an offering to his ancestors.

His ancestors appeared! They said, 'Rama, you are brave and showed us great respect. Ask for a gift!'

Rama asked, 'Please forgive me for all the fighting.  Make these bloody lakes holy places.'"

His ancestors said, 'It shall be so.'  And the place became known as the holy Samanta-panchaka.  Later, a HUGE battle happened there between the Pandavas and the Kauravas.  Many, many soldiers died.

The wise men then asked, "What's an Akshauhini?"

Sauti explained, "An Akshauhini is a giant army! It's made of small groups:  one group has one chariot, one elephant, three horses, and five soldiers.  Three of those groups make a bigger group, and so on, until you have a whole Akshauhini!  It's a very, very big number!"

There were eighteen of these giant armies at the battle!  Great warriors like Bhishma, Drona, and Karna fought for many days. Finally, everyone died.

Sauti then told the wise men about the Mahabharata, a HUGE story with many parts, or "Parvas".  He listed all the Parvas:  There's the beginning, where we learn about the heroes and their birth.  Then there are stories about weddings, battles, tricks, and more battles!  There are also wise lessons and sad stories.  The Mahabharata is like a big, big puzzle with many different pieces. It's very, very important, like a treasure!

The Mahabharata explains everything, just like a big tree has many branches and leaves. This one story tells many smaller stories, and all stories are part of it. It's a very, very important story! The end.
