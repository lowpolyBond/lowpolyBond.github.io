Yudhishthira, the wise king, told Arjuna, his brother: "Arjuna, I know a lot about the holy books and the ways to become one with the great spirit, Brahma.  These books talk about doing things and about not doing things – it's confusing!  I understand the real meaning behind the sacred words. You're great with weapons and fighting, but you don't understand these books as well as I do.  Your words were kind, though, and I appreciate that."

Yudhishthira continued, "You're the best warrior in the whole world!  You're amazing at fighting, and you can talk about battle strategies better than anyone. But you've never spent time with old, wise people who understand the holy books deeply. They know that being peaceful and understanding Brahma is better than just doing good deeds. They know that understanding Brahma is the best of all. You think wealth is the most important thing, but that's wrong!  Good people are kind and study the holy books. Wise people who do good deeds go to heaven. People who give up wanting things go to a special, peaceful place.  Those who focus on doing things go to a different place. The best place, though, is indescribable; it's reached through Yoga. It’s hard to explain."

"Some wise people study the holy books, but they get confused. They're like people looking for strong wood, but only finding a weak banana plant!  Our soul is very small and can't be seen. It goes through life after life, always doing things.  To be truly happy, we must calm our minds, stop wanting things, and stop doing so many things. Then we'll be free!  Arjuna, why do you praise wealth when this path to peace exists?  Many wise people from long ago believed the same. Some people argue and deny this path even exists, making it hard to understand.  They travel around and speak against it.  They, like you, don't understand the truth of the holy books. Only those who are truly wise understand this path. We achieve great things through peaceful living and knowledge. Renunciation brings true happiness!"
