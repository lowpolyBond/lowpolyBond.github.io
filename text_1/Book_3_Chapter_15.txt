King Yudhishthira was curious.  "Krishna," he asked, "tell me all about how the king of Saubha died! I want to know everything!"

Krishna, a powerful warrior, began, "King Salwa was angry.  I had defeated his son in battle.  So, Salwa attacked Dwaraka, Krishna's city. He attacked from the sky!  It was a huge battle!"

Dwaraka was a strong city.  It had high walls, towers, and lots of soldiers.  There were archers, soldiers with spears, and even machines that threw fire! They had hidden traps and lots of food.  Everyone was ready to fight.

Krishna and his friends, like Uddhava and Gada, were ready.  To keep everyone focused, they didn't let anyone drink alcohol.  They even sent away all the singers and dancers.  They destroyed all the bridges and made the ground around the city tricky to walk on â€“ lots of holes and hidden dangers!

The city was super prepared.  It was so well-protected, it looked like the city of the gods!  Only people with a special secret sign were allowed in or out.  The streets were full of elephants and horses. Every soldier had lots of food, weapons, and new clothes. They were all well-paid and brave.  King Ugrasena, Krishna's grandfather, made sure everyone was ready for battle.  Dwaraka was very safe and strong, ready for anything!
