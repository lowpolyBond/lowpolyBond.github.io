Once upon a time, a very good king visited some wise holy men.  He spent the night with his brothers and showed them great respect.  A holy man named Lomasa told him all their names – the Bhrigus, the Angiras, the Vasishthas, and the Kasyapas. The king bowed to each one.

He then asked Akritavrana, a follower of the powerful warrior Parasurama, when he could see Parasurama. He really wanted to meet this great warrior!

Akritavrana said, "Parasurama already knows you're here. He likes you and will show himself.  The holy men can see him on the 8th and 14th day of the moon. Tomorrow is the 14th. You'll see him then, wearing a dark deerskin and with long, matted hair."

King Yudhishthira then asked Akritavrana, "You've seen Parasurama do amazing things! Please tell me about his battles and why he fought!"

Akritavrana happily agreed.  "Long ago," he began, "there was a powerful king named Arjuna with a thousand arms! He had a magical golden chariot that could go anywhere.  Because of a special wish he'd been granted, he was very powerful and even bullied gods and other holy people!  The gods asked Vishnu, a very strong god, to stop him."

Vishnu talked to Indra, the king of the gods, about defeating Arjuna. They decided something had to be done.  Around the same time, a great king named Gadhi lived in a forest.  He had a beautiful daughter.  A holy man, Richika, wanted to marry her.

But Gadhi had a tradition: the groom had to give a thousand brown horses, each with a single black ear, as a gift.  Richika was a holy man, so Gadhi said he didn’t have to.

But Richika said, "I'll get them!" He asked Varuna, the god of water, for the horses. Varuna gave him a thousand horses that came from the Ganges River!  That's why that place is called "The Horse's Landing Place."

Richika married Gadhi’s daughter, Satyavati. The gods even came to the wedding!  Richika’s father, Bhrigu, came to visit.  He was so happy, he offered Satyavati a wish. She wished for a son.  Bhrigu told her and her mother to bathe, embrace certain trees, and eat special rice and milk he gave them.

But Satyavati and her mother accidentally switched the trees and the food!  Bhrigu, being very wise, knew what happened. He said Satyavati would have a son who would be a priest but act like a warrior, and her mother would have a warrior son who would act like a priest.  Satyavati wished her *grandson* to be the warrior, and Bhrigu made it so.

Satyavati had a son named Jamadagni.  He grew up to be a very strong and wise warrior and learned all about fighting and weapons naturally!  And that, my friends, is how Parasurama's father, Jamadagni, came to be.
