Once upon a time, a wise storyteller named Sauti went to visit some very holy sages. These sages were doing a long, special prayer in the Naimisha forest.  They wanted to hear Sauti's amazing stories.

Sauti bowed politely and asked the sages how their prayers were going.  He then sat down and one of the sages asked, "Sauti, where have you been? Tell us everything!"

Sauti said, "I heard the great story of the Mahabharata!  The wise Vyasa wrote it, and Vaisampayana told it at King Janamejaya's special ceremony.  I traveled to the place where the great battle happened, and then I came here to see you."

The sages said, "We want to hear the Mahabharata! It's a very important story, full of wisdom and lessons from the Vedas."

Sauti said, "I will tell you the story.  Long ago, before the world had light, there was a giant egg. From this egg came Brahma, the creator god.  Then came other gods, and people, and animals.  Everything was born!"

Sauti continued, "At the end of time, everything will disappear.  But then a new world will be born, just like the seasons change. This keeps happening again and again."

Sauti explained that the story starts with the Kuru and Pandu families.  Many kings and heroes came from these families. Vyasa wrote down all their stories in a huge book.  He wanted to share this knowledge with everyone.

Vyasa needed help writing down the story. He asked Ganesh, the elephant god, to write it.  But Ganesh could only write if his pen kept moving!  So Vyasa told the story very, very quickly, to keep Ganesh writing!

Sauti said, "I know a big part of the story. It's full of wise lessons and amazing adventures!" The Mahabharata is like a big tree, said Sauti, with many parts – roots, branches, leaves, flowers and fruits – all filled with stories and adventures.

The story starts long ago, with Vyasa, who had three sons: Dhritarashtra, Pandu, and Vidura.  Pandu's sons – the Pandavas – were very brave and kind.  Dhritarashtra's sons – the Kauravas – were mean and jealous.

The Pandavas and Kauravas had many adventures. Arjuna won a beautiful princess in an archery contest. The Pandavas fought many battles and won!  They even did a big ceremony called the Rajasuya Yagna.  But the Kauravas were so jealous they tricked the Pandavas into a game of dice and they lost everything!

Because of this trick, a great war happened.  Sauti told many stories of this great war. He told of brave heroes like Arjuna and Bhima, and wicked villains like Duryodhana and Karna.  Many battles were fought with great magic and power!  The Pandavas eventually won the war.

Then Sauti told Dhritarashtra's sorrow because his family and many warriors had died. He felt very sad and wanted to die too. Sanjaya, a wise advisor, told Dhritarashtra not to worry too much because everything follows a natural order. Even great kings meet their fate.

Sauti ended the story by saying, "The Mahabharata is a holy story. It teaches us many things. Reading even a little bit can help us be better people.”
