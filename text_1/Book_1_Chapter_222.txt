Arjuna, the brave warrior, wanted to marry Subhadra.  He asked his brother, Yudhishthira, if it was okay. Yudhishthira said yes!  Arjuna also talked to Krishna, Subhadra's uncle, and Krishna said yes too!

Arjuna hopped into his shiny golden chariot.  It had bells that jingled, and it was pulled by strong horses named Saivya and Sugriva.  It looked like a blazing fire!

Subhadra was visiting a big hill called Raivataka.  She was praying and walking around.  Arjuna saw her!  He zoomed over and took Subhadra to his chariot.  He whisked her away!

Subhadra’s friends saw this and ran to tell everyone in Dwaraka, their city.  They told the king's helpers.  The helpers blew a loud horn!  This was the alarm!

All the strong warriors of Dwaraka rushed in. They were the Bhojas, Vrishnis, and Andhakas. They were very angry! They all sat on their golden thrones.

Valadeva, a big and strong warrior, told everyone to calm down. He said, "Let's wait for Krishna to speak.  We shouldn’t be angry until we know what Krishna thinks."

Everyone quieted down.  Then, another warrior, Rama, was furious! He said, "Arjuna took Subhadra! He’s shown us no respect!  It's like breaking a plate after eating from it!  He should be punished!"

All the other warriors agreed with Rama. They were ready to fight! They were as loud as thunder!
