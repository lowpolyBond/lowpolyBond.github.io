Long ago, in the land of Ayodhya, many kings ruled one after another.  First came King Sasada, then his grandson Kakutstha, and then Anenas, Prithu, Viswagaswa, Adri, Yuvanaswa, and Sravastha.  Sravastha even built a city called Sravasthi!  After him came Vrihadaswa, and Vrihadaswa had a super-strong son named Kuvalaswa.  Kuvalaswa had 21,000 sons!  When Kuvalaswa grew up, his dad, Vrihadaswa, gave him the throne. Then, Vrihadaswa decided to become a hermit and live in the forest.


A wise holy man named Utanka heard about this. He rushed to Vrihadaswa and said, "King, you must stay! It's your job to protect your people.  A desert demon named Dhundhu lives nearby.  He’s super scary and powerful. He makes the whole earth shake every year with his breath! He wants to rule the whole world! Only you can defeat him."


Utanka explained that Dhundhu was so strong, even the gods couldn't kill him. But, a long time ago, the great god Vishnu promised that whoever defeated Dhundhu would get Vishnu’s amazing strength! Utanka begged Vrihadaswa, “Please, King, slay Dhundhu! Then everyone will be safe, and you’ll be famous forever!"  Vrihadaswa, knowing it was his duty, agreed to fight the fearsome demon.
