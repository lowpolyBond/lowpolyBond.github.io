King Dhritarashtra, a very wise king, wanted to see Vidura. He sent a messenger to get him.  The messenger found Vidura and told him the king needed to see him right away.

Vidura went to the palace. He told the guard that he had arrived. The guard told King Dhritarashtra.  The king said, "Let Vidura come in! I'm always happy to see him."

Vidura bowed to the king, who was deep in thought.  "I'm here, your Majesty," Vidura said. "Tell me what you need."

King Dhritarashtra was worried. His messenger, Sanjaya, had just returned from the Pandavas (his nephews). Sanjaya had scolded Dhritarashtra, and was going to share a message from another king tomorrow.  Dhritarashtra couldn't sleep because he was so worried about the message.  He asked Vidura, "I can't sleep!  What can help someone who is worried and can't sleep?"

Vidura said, "People can't sleep if they're worried about something bad happening, like losing their money or being in danger. Are you worried about something like that, King?"

Dhritarashtra said, "I need your wise advice, Vidura. You're the wisest person I know."

Vidura said, "Your nephew, Yudhishthira, is a wonderful king – he deserves to rule the whole world! But you sent him away. You are a good person, but you made a mistake. Yudhishthira is kind and good, even though you treated him badly. You gave the kingdom to Duryodhana and others, and that’s why you are unhappy. To be wise, you need to be brave, patient, and honest. You need to do what is right, even if it's hard.  A wise person isn't controlled by anger or pride.  They think carefully before they act, and they keep their plans secret from their enemies. They don't let things like the weather or how much money they have stop them from doing what is right.  A wise person understands that everything changes, and that all living things will eventually die.  They are also good at talking to others and understanding what they read. A foolish person is lazy, proud, and dishonest. They gossip, they don't keep their promises, and they hurt others. They only care about themselves."

Vidura then gave the king lots of advice about how to live a good life. He talked about how to be a good king, a good friend, and a good person. He explained that forgiveness is very powerful, that it's important to be kind and generous, and that true wisdom comes from understanding the world and yourself. He also talked about things that bring happiness (like good friends and a loving family) and things that lead to unhappiness (like being greedy or unkind).  He told the king that if he gave his nephews back their share of the kingdom, everyone would be happy.

"By being a wise and fair king, you'll have the respect of both the gods and the people," Vidura concluded.
