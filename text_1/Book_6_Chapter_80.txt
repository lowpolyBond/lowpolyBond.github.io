The sun turned red.  Duryodhana, wanting to fight, ran towards Bhima.  Bhima was very angry! "This is the day I've waited for!" he shouted. "I will kill you unless you stop fighting!  You hurt my family. You made fun of us. You ignored Krishna's pleas for peace.  I will avenge all this!"

Bhima bent his bow.  WHOOSH!  He shot 36 arrows at Duryodhana! They flew like lightning.  Two arrows broke Duryodhana's bow.  Two more hit his driver.  Four arrows sent Duryodhana's horses to the land of the dead!  Then Bhima knocked off Duryodhana's umbrella and his fancy flag!  The flag fell to the ground.

Bhima, smiling, shot ten more arrows at Duryodhana.  A friend helped Duryodhana get into a new chariot.  Jayadratha tried to stop Bhima, but lots of other warriors joined the fight!

Abhimanyu was a brave warrior. He fought bravely against many enemies, shooting arrows like rain!  But they shot many arrows at him too. Abhimanyu then shot fourteen arrows and knocked Vikarna's flag down, killing his driver and horses.  He shot more arrows, and they went right through Vikarna!

Vikarna’s brothers attacked Abhimanyu.  Durmukha fought against Srutakarman. Durmukha broke Srutakarman’s flag and killed his horses and driver, but Srutakarman threw a powerful spear back!  A friend helped Srutakarman into a new chariot.  Srutakirti fought Jayatsena.  Jayatsena broke Srutakirti's bow.  Then Satanika fought Jayatsena and Dushkarna.  Satanika killed Dushkarna's horses and Dushkarna himself! Five warriors attacked Satanika but his friends the Kekaya brothers helped him.

Durmukha, Durjaya, Durmarshana, Satranjaya, and Satrusha fought the Kekaya brothers. It was a big battle!  Many warriors died.  Then Bhishma, a powerful warrior, fought for Duryodhana's side, but he stopped fighting and went home.  Yudhishthira was happy to see his brothers safe and he went home too.
