Once upon a time, a powerful warrior named Bhishma met a very strong holy man named Rama. Rama was angry!  He sent a message to Bhishma: "I'm here!  Do what I say!"

Bhishma was happy to see Rama. He went to meet him with gifts: a cow, many priests, and important people.  Rama didn't care about the gifts.  He was upset with Bhishma.

Rama said, "Bhishma, you took a princess from a king! Then you let her go.  Now no one wants to marry her! You should marry her!"

Bhishma said, "I can't! She told me she loved someone else.  I let her go."  Bhishma was a warrior, and he promised he'd never go back on his word.

Rama got even angrier! He shouted, "If you don't marry her, I will fight you!"

Bhishma was sad.  Rama was his teacher! Bhishma begged Rama to stop, reminding Rama that he was his student. But Rama wouldn't listen.  He said, "You're my student, but you won't listen to me!  You must marry the princess!"

Bhishma explained, "I can't marry a woman who doesn't love me.  It's not right." He also said, "You're my teacher, but you aren't teaching me the right way.  If you make me fight, I will fight."

Rama laughed. He said, "Great! Let's fight at Kurukshetra!"  He even said mean things about Bhishma's mother, the River Ganga.

Bhishma,  very respectful, bowed.  He told his mother, the River Ganga, everything. Ganga tried to convince Rama to not fight Bhishma, but Rama said no.  Ganga went back to Bhishma, but he was determined. He refused to give in.  

Then, Rama himself appeared.  He was ready to fight.  The great battle was about to begin!
