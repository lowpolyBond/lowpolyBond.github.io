King Bhishma was looking at the Pandava army.  He knew their best fighters.  He said, "Sikhandin, a brave warrior from Panchala, is one of Yudhishthira's strongest fighters. He'll be very brave in battle!"

Sikhandin had lots of soldiers to help him.  They'd fight very well.  

"Dhrishtadyumna is the leader of the Pandava army," Bhishma said. "He's incredibly strong and he learned from the great teacher Drona. He'll be like a storm on the battlefield!"  He'll be amazing!  He'll have so many soldiers, it will look like a huge ocean!

Dhrishtadyumna's son, Kshattradharman, was still young, so he wasn't as strong yet.  

"Dhrishtaketu, Sisupala’s son, is a super strong warrior! He and his son will do amazing things in battle," Bhishma explained.

Kshatradeva was another strong Pandava fighter.  Jayanta, Amitaujas, and Satyajit were also very powerful warriors from Panchala –  they were like furious elephants in battle!  Aja and Bhoja were also super strong fighters.  

Then there were five brothers with red banners! They were incredible fighters.  Their names were Kasika, Sukumara, Nila, Suryadatta, and Sankha (also called Madiraswa). They knew how to use every kind of weapon.  

Vardhakshemi was a very strong warrior, and King Chitrayudha was a great fighter who always helped Arjuna. Chekitana and Satyadhriti were also very brave. Vyaghradatta and Chandrasena were strong warriors too.  

"Senavindu, also called Krodhahantri, is as strong as Bhima and Krishna," Bhishma said. "He'll be a tough opponent."

Kasya was a good fighter, and Satyajit, Dhrishtadyumna's son, was even stronger than his father!  King Pandya and Dhridadhanwan were also very powerful warriors.  

Finally, Bhishma said, "Srenimat and Krishna are both the strongest of the strong warriors!"
