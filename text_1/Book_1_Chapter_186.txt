Once upon a time, there were five amazing brothers, the Pandavas. They were strong and brave, like tigers!  They were going on a trip to Panchala, a faraway land.

On their way, they met some wise Brahmins (holy men). The Brahmins asked, "Where are you going?"

Yudhishthira, the oldest brother, answered, "We are traveling with our mother. We came from Ekachakra."

The Brahmins said, "You should go to King Drupada's palace in Panchala!  His daughter, Draupadi, is having a special wedding ceremony called a Swayamvara.  It will be a huge party with lots of fun and gifts!"

They told the Pandavas about Draupadi.  She was very beautiful, like a lotus flower.  She was smart and kind.  Many kings and princes would come to win her hand in marriage.  There would be singers, dancers, and lots of exciting things to see!

The Brahmins invited the Pandavas to join them.  They said, "You'll get lots of gifts and have a wonderful time! Maybe even one of you might win Draupadi's hand!"

Yudhishthira happily agreed. "Yes," he said, "we will go with you to see this wonderful Swayamvara!"  And so, the Pandavas and the Brahmins went together to see Draupadi and the amazing wedding celebration.
