Baladeva, a strong and wise man, spoke.  "Everyone heard Yudhisthira's wise words," he said.  "The Pandavas, Yudhisthira's brothers, are willing to share their kingdom. They want peace with Duryodhana."

"So the Kauravas, Duryodhana's family, should also share the kingdom.  Everyone should be happy!  If everyone behaves well, both the Pandavas and the Kauravas will be peaceful and happy. This would be good for everyone."

Baladeva continued, "Someone should go to Duryodhana to talk.  This person should speak politely to everyone: Bhishma, Drona, Vidura, Kripa, the King of Gandhara, and all the Kauravas. He should also talk to the wise old people of the city. He should say kind things and try to make peace with Duryodhana. He should remind them that the Pandavas lost their kingdom in a game of dice.  Yudhisthira, though brave, wasn't good at dice.  He even chose to play against Sakuni, who was a very clever dice player, and lost everything."

Baladeva added, "Don't blame Sakuni. Be kind to Duryodhana.  Peace is better than war. Try talking, not fighting.  Peace will last longer."

While Baladeva was still speaking, a brave man from the Sini family stood up.  He disagreed and shouted angrily!
