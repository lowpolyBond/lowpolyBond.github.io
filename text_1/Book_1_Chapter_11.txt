Once upon a time, there was a talking drum named Dundubha.  He had a friend named Khagama, who was very powerful because he prayed a lot.  One day, Khagama was doing a special fire ceremony. Dundubha, being silly, made a fake snake out of grass and tried to scare his friend!

Khagama fainted! When he woke up, he was very angry.  He said, "Because you scared me with your fake snake, you will become a snake yourself!"

Dundubha was scared! He knew Khagama was very powerful. He begged for forgiveness. Khagama sighed. "It's too late," he said. "But don't worry.  You'll be a snake until you see Ruru, the son of Pramati.  And guess what? You *are* Ruru, the son of Pramati!"

And just like that, Dundubha turned into a snake!  But when Ruru appeared, Dundubha changed back into a talking drum!

He then told Ruru, "Being kind is the most important thing.  A wise person, especially a priest, should never hurt anyone. They should be gentle, know lots about their religion, and always help others."

Dundubha then told Ruru a story about a king who was going to kill all the snakes.  But a brave priest saved them!  And that's how the story ends.
