Once upon a time, a powerful king named Kartavirya was super strong! He had a thousand arms! He ruled a huge kingdom. He was very kind and gave lots of gifts to a wise holy man called Dattatreya.  The holy man was so happy, he gave Kartavirya three wishes.

Kartavirya wished for a thousand arms only when he was fighting, and just two arms at home. He also wished to conquer the whole world, and for good people to always guide him if he did something wrong.  The holy man granted his wishes.

Kartavirya became even more powerful. He boasted, "I'm the strongest! Nobody is as strong or brave as me!"

Suddenly, a voice boomed from the sky, "Wrong! Brahmins (holy men) are stronger than kings!"

Arjuna, a great warrior, heard this and disagreed.  He said, "I'm the strongest! Brahmins just beg for food. I protect everyone.  I don't need them!"

But then, the wind god appeared! He warned Arjuna, "Don't be disrespectful to Brahmins! They are very powerful. If you hurt them, bad things will happen to you and your kingdom!"

Arjuna was surprised. He asked the wind god to explain more about Brahmins.  He wanted to know if they were like the wind, the sun, or the fire â€“ so powerful and important.  The story shows how important it is to be kind and respectful to everyone, even those who seem weaker.  The Brahmins, though they might seem humble, possess great power.
