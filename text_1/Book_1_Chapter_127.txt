King Pandu died.  He was a brave and good king, like a lion!  His wife, Madri, also died.  Dhritarashtra, the king's brother, told Vidura, "Let's have a big funeral for Pandu and Madri.  Give lots of gifts to everyone – cows, clothes, jewels, anything they want!  Make sure Kunti, Pandu's other wife, is happy with Madri's funeral.  And cover Madri’s body carefully, so the sun and wind can’t see it.  Don't be sad about Pandu; he was a great king, and left behind five amazing sons!"

Vidura and Bhishma chose a special place for the funeral.  The priests carried a bright fire.  They dressed Pandu and Madri in beautiful clothes and flowers, and put them on a fancy cart.  The cart had a white umbrella and pretty decorations.  People walked behind, playing music and giving away jewels.  They cried, "Oh, prince, where are you going? We miss you!"  Even Bhishma, Vidura, and the Pandava brothers cried.

They reached a lovely forest by the river Ganga. They washed Pandu’s body, put fragrant paste on him, and dressed him in a white outfit. He looked like he was just sleeping!  The Kauravas set fire to the funeral pyre.  They added beautiful flowers and scents.

When Kausalya, the queen, saw the fire, she cried, "My son, my son!" and fainted. Everyone was very sad.  Even the birds and animals seemed to cry with Kunti.  Bhishma and Vidura were heartbroken too.  Everyone performed the final water ceremony.

After the funeral, people comforted the Pandava brothers.  Everyone slept on the ground, feeling sad. For twelve whole days, the city mourned for King Pandu and his sons.
