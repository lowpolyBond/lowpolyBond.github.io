Yudhishthira arrived in heaven, but he wasn't happy.  He missed his brothers and friends!  He said, "Gods, where are my brave brothers? Where are Karna, Yudhamanyu, and Uttamaujas? They fought so bravely for me. I want to be with them."

He was especially sad about Karna.  "My mother told me to pour water for Karna after the battle," Yudhishthira said sadly. "I saw how much Karna looked like my mother, and I should have made him my friend instead of letting Arjuna kill him. Together, we would have been unbeatable!"

Yudhishthira also wanted to see his friends Draupadi and her sons. He didn't want heaven without them!

The gods said, "If you want to be with them, go find them!"

A magical messenger took Yudhishthira to where his friends were.  But the path was terrible! It was dark and smelly.  There were rotting bodies, sharp thorns, and boiling oil everywhere. It was scary and disgusting!

Yudhishthira asked the messenger, "How much farther? Where are my brothers?"

The messenger said, "This is as far as we can go.  If you're tired, you can go back."

Yudhishthira was so upset by the awful smell and sight of suffering, he wanted to turn back.  Just then, he heard voices crying for help.  They sounded familiar.

The voices called out, "Yudhishthira! Please help us!  Your presence brings comfort!"

Yudhishthira stopped.  He asked, "Who are you?"

The voices answered, "I am Karna! I am Bhima! I am Arjuna! I am Nakula! I am Sahadeva! I am Draupadi! I am her sons!"

Yudhishthira was shocked!  He couldn't understand why his loved ones were suffering in this awful place.  They were good people! They deserved better than this.

He was angry at the gods for this unfairness.  He told the messenger, "Tell the gods I'm staying here with my friends.  Their suffering makes my heaven empty!"  

The messenger went back to tell the gods what Yudhishthira said. Yudhishthira's love for his family and friends showed everyone that true heaven is where your loved ones are.
