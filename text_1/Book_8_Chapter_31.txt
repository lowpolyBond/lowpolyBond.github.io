Once upon a time, during a great battle, King Dhritarashtra was worried. He said, "Arjuna is so strong! He defeated everyone!  He even fought a god and won! He's amazing!"

Dhritarashtra wanted to know what his own army had done.  His advisor, Sanjaya, told him, "Your soldiers were hurt and tired. They were sad and went back to their tents. Karna, a great warrior, was angry. He said, 'Arjuna tricked us today, but tomorrow I will beat him!'"  Duryodhana, Dhritarashtra's son, agreed.  The soldiers rested and felt better. The next day, they saw the Pandavas’ army, all ready to fight.  Duryodhana thought of Karna.  He hoped Karna would save them.  Everyone looked to Karna for help.

Dhritarashtra asked, "What did Duryodhana do when everyone wanted Karna to fight? Did my soldiers look to Karna like people freezing cold look to the sun?"

Sanjaya said, "Karna was very strong and brave, almost as strong as a god! Duryodhana really hoped Karna could win.  But it was sad because even Karna couldn't always win against Arjuna." Dhritarashtra was very sad. He said, "It’s all because of my mistakes!  The Pandavas are too powerful.  They’re like a storm through my army!”

Sanjaya tried to comfort him, saying, "Don't worry so much about the past, King. Let's hear about the battle."

Sanjaya then told Dhritarashtra about Karna's plan. Karna told Duryodhana, "Tomorrow, I will fight Arjuna! I will either kill him or he will kill me. I haven’t fought him properly before. This time, I won't stop until I win or die.  My army is weak, so Arjuna will come for me. But I have a powerful bow, almost as strong as Arjuna's.  The only problem is my best arrow is gone. But my bow is still very strong. It’s even stronger than Arjuna’s bow!  With it, I will beat Arjuna.  But Arjuna has a magical bow, magical arrows, and a great driver, Krishna.  I need a great driver too.  Shalya, a mighty warrior, can be my driver!  Then, I will be stronger than Arjuna! I will win, and you will be king of everything!"

Duryodhana was happy. He said, "Do it, Karna!  We’ll support you!"  Duryodhana asked Shalya to be Karna’s driver.  Shalya agreed. Now Karna felt ready to face Arjuna.
