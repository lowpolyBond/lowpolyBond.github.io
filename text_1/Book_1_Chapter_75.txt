Once upon a time, a very long time ago, there was a great storyteller named Vaisampayana. He told a story about a long, long line of kings and queens.  It started with Daksha, a really important man, almost like a grandpa to everyone. Daksha had lots of kids! He even gave some daughters to other important people.  One of those important people was Kasyapa.  Kasyapa had a son named Vivaswat, the sun!

Vivaswat had a son named Manu, who was super wise.  Manu had lots of kids too!  All people are said to be descended from Manu.  Some of Manu's kids were kings, and some were wise people who studied the ancient books. One of Manu's sons, Pururavas, was a powerful king who ruled many islands. But he was greedy and mean to wise people, so they were angry and made him disappear!

Pururavas's son was Nahusha. Nahusha was a very strong and powerful king. He was so strong he even made the wise people carry him around like a chair! But even powerful kings can be unfair.

Nahusha’s son was Yayati. Yayati was a great king who ruled the whole Earth!  But as he got older, he became very, very old and ugly.  He asked his sons to switch places with him, so he could be young again and have fun.  None of his sons wanted to, except his youngest, Puru.  Puru was kind and gave his youth to his father.

Yayati was young again! He had a great time, but even after all that fun, he still wasn't happy. He realized that being happy wasn't about having everything, but being good.  So he gave his youth back to Puru, and made Puru his heir, meaning Puru would be the next king.  Yayati then became a wise man and went to live in the mountains.

And that's how the line of kings continued, all thanks to Manu, and then Puru, Yayati's kind son.  The story goes on from there…but that's another story for another time!
