Once upon a time, in the land of Hastinapura, the good King Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandpa, what should the priests who help us with our important ceremonies be like?"

Bhishma smiled. "Yudhishthira, the best priests know a lot about sacred songs and rituals.  They help the king by doing good things. They are kind and honest.  They are fair to everyone, and never hurt anyone. They don't lie or cheat. They are happy with what they have and are always truthful.  A truly good priest is peaceful, humble, and helpful. They are wise and kind to all living things."

Yudhishthira then said, "Grandpa, the holy books talk about giving gifts during ceremonies. But they don't say exactly how much to give.  What if someone can't afford to give a big gift? It seems unfair."

Bhishma explained, "Yudhishthira, being honest and following the sacred teachings is most important.  A gift is a part of the ceremony, it helps keep the holy teachings alive.  Even a small, sincere offering is better than a big one given dishonestly.  The most important things are that the person giving the gift, the ceremony itself, and the special offerings are all pure and good.  A bad person can't get blessings, no matter how much they give."

Bhishma continued, "The wisest people say that being kind, truthful, and helpful is more important than doing hard things for the body. Ignoring the sacred teachings or breaking rules brings only trouble.  True holiness comes from a pure heart and a good mind, not just from religious ceremonies."  He said, "Think of it this way:  For holy people, their good deeds are like the spoon for their offerings, their pure heart is like the melted butter, and their wisdom is like the special strainer."

"Being good is like reaching the highest place in the world," Bhishma concluded. "It's not about following complicated rules, but about being honest and kind."
