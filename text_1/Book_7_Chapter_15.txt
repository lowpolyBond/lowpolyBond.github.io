King Dhritarashtra was blind, but he loved to hear about the great battle.  His friend Sanjaya told him all about it.  Dhritarashtra said, "Sanjaya, these fights are amazing! I wish I could see them!  Tell me about the fight between Bhima and Salya."

Sanjaya said, "Salya's chariot driver was killed. Salya was furious! He jumped down and grabbed his giant iron mace.  Bhima, Subhadra's son, also had a huge mace.  It looked like a lightning bolt! He shouted, 'Come on, fight!' But Bhima told him to wait.

Bhima fought Salya instead.  They were both strong! The battle was loud!  Drums beat, trumpets blew, and everyone shouted. It was a huge, noisy fight!  No other king could fight Bhima, and no one but Bhima could fight Salya!

Bhima’s mace was beautiful, with gold wire. Salya’s mace was bright like lightning. They swung their maces, roaring like angry bulls.  They fought so hard that sparks flew!  Bhima’s mace broke, and so did Salya's! They crashed into each other, again and again, like two tigers fighting.

They were covered in blood, but they didn't stop.  Finally, they both fell down at the same time,  thump!  Like two giant trees falling.

Kritavarman rushed to help Salya. He carried the hurt Salya away.  Bhima stood up quickly.  The Kauravas – Dhritarashtra’s sons – were scared!  They ran away with their elephants and soldiers. The Pandavas had won! They were happy and shouted with joy!  They blew their horns and beat their drums.  They had won the battle!"
