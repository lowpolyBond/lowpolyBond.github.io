Once upon a time, during a great battle, Arjuna (also called Partha) fought Ashwatthama, Drona's son.  Ashwatthama was a powerful warrior, surrounded by many soldiers. He shot many arrows at Arjuna and Krishna, who was Arjuna’s friend and charioteer.  Everyone watched in amazement!

Arjuna, smiling, used a magical weapon. But Ashwatthama was so strong, he stopped the weapon!  Ashwatthama fought like a fierce warrior. He shot arrows everywhere, even hitting Krishna.  Arjuna then killed Ashwatthama's horses, causing a river of blood to flow on the battlefield.  Many soldiers died.

Ashwatthama fought back bravely. He shot many arrows at Arjuna, even breaking his bow. Then he threw a heavy mace, but Arjuna cleverly cut it in half! Ashwatthama used another powerful weapon, but Arjuna stopped that too. They fought fiercely, showering each other with arrows. Arjuna finally defeated Ashwatthama, killing his charioteer and wounding him badly.

After defeating Ashwatthama,  Arjuna saw that Karna, a great warrior fighting for the other side, was winning. Karna was using a super powerful weapon that rained down arrows like a storm.  The Pandava army was losing badly and many soldiers were crying.  The earth trembled!

Arjuna’s friend Krishna said Arjuna needed to help his injured brother Yudhishthira first. So Arjuna went to look for him, leaving Karna to continue his attack.  Arjuna had fought bravely against Ashwatthama and won, but a bigger challenge still remained.
