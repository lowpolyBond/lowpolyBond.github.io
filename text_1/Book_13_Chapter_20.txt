Once upon a time, a wise old man named Ashtavakra needed a bath. A kind old lady helped him.  She rubbed him with fragrant oil, then washed him with warm water.  Ashtavakra was so relaxed, he didn't realize the whole night had passed!  When he finished his bath, the sun was up!

The lady then made him a delicious meal.  After he ate, it was time for bed.  The lady gave Ashtavakra a comfortable bed, and she took another one.  But in the middle of the night, she came to his bed.

Ashtavakra said, "Kind lady, I can't be with you.  My heart belongs only to my wife."

The lady said, "But I'm free to choose!  Being with you wouldn't be wrong."

Ashtavakra said, "Women are not truly free.  A father, a husband, or sons always protect them."

The lady insisted, "I love you!  It would be wrong for you to refuse me!"

Ashtavakra explained, "I must control my desires.  It's the right thing to do."

The lady pleaded, "Please marry me!  I'm devoted to you.  If there is any wrong, it's my fault."

Ashtavakra said, "It's true you say you are free. But no woman is truly her own master.  A father protects a young girl. A husband protects her when she is grown, and her sons protect her when she is old. But if you have always been a good girl, I'll ask you something important."

The lady explained, "Since I was young, I have promised to stay a good girl, and never do anything that's not proper."

Ashtavakra wondered, "Is it right for me to be with you? Will it be right in the eyes of the old wise men who are watching us?  This lady is beautiful, but will she always be? I will always choose to be true to what's right."


Ashtavakra then said, "I am drawn to you, but I must also think of what is right. This is a very difficult choice!"
