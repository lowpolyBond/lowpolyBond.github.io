King Dhritarashtra said, "That was a wonderful story, Vidura!  You know so much!"

Vidura said, "Listen, King! I'll tell you more about how to escape the troubles of life.  Imagine life as a long, long journey.  People who aren't very wise get tired, and they have to stop and start again many times. This is like being reborn over and over.  But wise people don't have to stop so much."

"Life is like a big, scary forest," Vidura continued. "Everyone, big or small, has to go through it again and again. But wise people find a way out."

"Sicknesses are like wild animals," Vidura explained. "They hurt us, and we can't see all of them.  But not-so-wise people don’t even notice the danger. Then, even if we escape sickness, old age comes. It's like getting stuck in mud!  The days and years go by, and we get older and weaker. These are all signs that we are getting closer to death.  But many people don't understand this."

"Everything is controlled by a great power," said Vidura. "Think of your body as a cart.  You are the driver. Your senses are the horses, and your actions and thoughts are the reins. If you let your horses run wild, you’ll have to take this journey again and again. But if you control them, you won't have to."

"If you are wise, you won't be stuck in this cycle of life," Vidura said. "Being kind, gentle and not angry helps a lot. You need to control your feelings and be honest. This will bring you peace. This body is like a cart that can take you to death, but wise people are not fooled by it."

"Losing things like your kingdom, friends, or family hurts," Vidura said. "But wisdom is the best cure for sadness. Nothing helps more than controlling yourself. Be kind to everyone, and don't hurt anyone. Self-control, giving things up, and paying attention are the best ways to reach a peaceful place.  If you are kind to everyone, you will go to a wonderful place. Kindness is even better than doing many prayers or going without food.  Nothing is more important than being kind to yourself. Everyone is afraid of death, so we should be kind to everyone."

"People who are not wise make many mistakes," Vidura finished. "But those who are wise and kind will find true peace."
