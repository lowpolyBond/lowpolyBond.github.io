A wise man visited a kind host.  The wise man spoke comforting words.

The host felt so relieved! He said, "Your words are like cool water to a thirsty person, or a soft bed to a tired traveler!  They're like finding a seat after standing for a long time, or getting delicious food when you're hungry!  They're as joyful as finding a lost friend!"

He looked up at the wise man and listened carefully. "You've taught me so much!" he exclaimed.  "I'll do exactly as you said.  Please stay the night! Rest and relax."  The sun was starting to set.

The wise man spent the night with the host. They talked happily about life and giving things up.  Time flew by! They talked so much, it felt like daytime!

In the morning, the host showed his guest great respect. He was excited to start his new plan, based on the wise man's advice. He said goodbye to his family and left to visit a giant snake, a Naga. He was determined to do what the wise man had suggested.
