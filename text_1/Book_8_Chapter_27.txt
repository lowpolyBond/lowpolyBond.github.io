Sanjaya said, "King, Arjuna was amazing! He fought so bravely, he scattered the enemy like the wind blows away cotton!  Many warriors attacked him: the Trigartas, the Sivis, the Kauravas, the Salwas, and the Narayanas.  Brave kings like Satyasena, Candradeva, Mitradeva, and Satrunjaya all fought Arjuna.  They shot many arrows at him, like a huge wave crashing against the ocean. But Arjuna was too strong!  He fought like Garuda, the eagle, fighting snakes.  Thousands of enemies attacked him, but they couldn't stop him.

Satyasena hit Arjuna with three arrows, Mitradeva with thirty-six, and others hit him too.  But Arjuna fought back! He hit them all back, many more arrows for each hit he took! He even shot Satyasena, Candradeva, and Mitradeva many times! Then, Arjuna killed Satrunjaya and Susruta's son. He also killed Candradeva with many arrows.  He shot the other kings too, stopping them with just a few arrows each.

Then, a very strong warrior, Satyasena, threw a huge spear at Krishna, Arjuna's friend! The spear hit Krishna's arm, and he dropped the reins of the chariot!  Arjuna was very angry. He told Krishna, “Drive us towards Satyasena! I’ll kill him!”  Krishna quickly got the reins and drove the chariot closer.

Arjuna killed Satyasena. He also killed Citravarman and his driver.  Then, Arjuna was very angry and fought many, many Samsaptakas. He shot hundreds and thousands of them! He even cut off Mitrasena’s head!  He hurt Susharma too.

All the remaining Samsaptakas got very angry. They attacked Arjuna all at once.  But Arjuna was so strong, he used a super powerful weapon! It shot out thousands of arrows!  It was a huge battle! Chariots, horses, and soldiers fell everywhere.  The ground was covered with weapons, parts of chariots, and dead soldiers. The battlefield looked like a sky full of clouds!  The ground was so full of dead soldiers and elephants that it was hard to walk.  Arjuna’s chariot wheels almost got stuck in the bodies!  But his strong horses pulled him through.

Arjuna won! He had defeated almost all the enemies. He stood there, shining like a bright fire."
