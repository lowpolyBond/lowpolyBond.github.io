Once upon a time, a wise Brahmin was in trouble.  His family was starving! Queen Kunti, Yudhishthira’s kind mother, felt very sorry for him. She gave him some special food meant for a scary monster called a Rakshasa.  She told Yudhishthira, "I helped the Brahmin.  Bhima, my strong son, will go and get the food back from the Rakshasa. He'll be safe, because I helped the Brahmin."  Yudhishthira said, "Okay, Mother, but tell the Brahmin to keep it a secret!"

The next morning, strong Bhima went to the Rakshasa’s forest. He ate the food, calling out the Rakshasa’s name really loudly!

The Rakshasa was HUGE! He had red eyes, red hair, and a red beard.  His mouth went from ear to ear!  He was super scary!  He saw Bhima eating *his* food.  "Who are you, fool?" he roared, "Eating my food? You want to die?!"

Bhima just kept eating! He didn’t even look at the angry Rakshasa. The Rakshasa yelled and ran at Bhima, ready to fight!  He hit Bhima hard on the back!  But Bhima didn’t stop eating!

The Rakshasa got even angrier. He pulled up trees and threw them at Bhima!  Bhima just finished his food, washed up, and started throwing trees back!  It was a huge tree fight!  The forest had no trees left!

Finally, the Rakshasa, whose name was Vaka, jumped on Bhima. They wrestled and wrestled!  The ground shook!  Big trees fell down! Bhima was very strong.  He pushed Vaka to the ground.  He held Vaka down with his knee and started to beat him.  Poor Vaka cried out and even coughed up blood!  Bhima had won! He had saved the Brahmin's family!
