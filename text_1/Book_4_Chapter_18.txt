Draupadi was very sad.  She said to her brother-in-law, "Why do you ask if I'm sad?  It's because of my husband, Yudhishthira!  He lost everything in a game!

First, a mean man called me a slave in front of everyone.  That hurt so much!  Then, another bad man was mean to me in the forest. And a really bad man named Kichaka, who worked for King Virata, kept asking me to marry him!  It was awful!

Yudhishthira is a terrible gambler. He gambled away our kingdom, our wealth, even me!  He used to be a great king!  He had lots of servants, and people gave him gifts.  He was kind to everyone, helping the poor and the sick. Now, he's poor and works for someone else!  He's called himself Kanka now, and he's just a servant!  He's a great king reduced to a servant. He used to be waited on by kings and wise men! Now, he waits on others!

Seeing my husband like this, so low, makes me so sad.  Isn't that enough reason to be unhappy?"
