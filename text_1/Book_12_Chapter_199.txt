Once upon a time, a very wise and holy man lived at the foot of a big mountain.  He was a great reader of sacred books and prayed very hard every day for a thousand years!  A goddess appeared and said, "I'm happy with your prayers!"

The holy man, still busy reading, didn't say a word.  The goddess was even happier!  She gave him a special gift: he could enjoy reading forever and ever. He could also become totally peaceful inside.

The goddess told him, "Dharma (Goodness), Time, Death, and Yama (the god of death) will come to visit you, and you'll have a big talk about what's right and wrong."

After a thousand more years of reading, Goodness appeared! Goodness said, "You've earned a wonderful reward! You can go anywhere you want!"

But the holy man loved his reading so much! He said, "I don't want to go anywhere. I'm happy right here!"

Goodness said, "But you have to leave your body someday!  Go to heaven!"

The holy man said, "No, thank you. I'm perfectly happy with my body and my books."

Then, Time, Death, and Yama arrived.  They all said, "You've done wonderful things!  It's time to go to a better place!"

The holy man welcomed them, gave them water to wash their feet, and asked, "What can I do for you?"

Just then, a king named Ikshvaku arrived.  He bowed to the holy man and the others.  The king asked the holy man, "I'm a king. What can I give you?"

The holy man said, "I don't want anything. I'm content with my life."  But he then asked the king, "What do *you* need?"

The king said, "Kings fight!  Let's have a debate!"

The holy man agreed.  The king asked for half of the holy man's reward for all his prayers. The holy man happily gave it!  But the king wouldn't accept it!

Then, two funny-looking guys showed up.  They were arguing about who owed whom a favor. The holy man showed everyone how important it is to be truthful. He explained that truth is more important than anything else.  The king, the holy man and the funny-looking guys(Desire and Anger) had a long discussion about honesty and doing whatâ€™s right.

Finally, the king understood. He accepted the holy man's gift and understood that being truthful was the greatest reward. Everyone learned that honesty was the most important thing, more than heaven itself.  The holy man continued to read his books, happy and peaceful. The end.
