Once upon a time, King Yudhishthira asked Krishna, a powerful warrior,  "Krishna, why are Brahmins, or wise holy men, so important?"

Krishna smiled. "Let me tell you a story," he said.  "My son, Pradyumna, once got angry with some Brahmins. He asked me, 'Dad, why are Brahmins so special?'"

Krishna continued, "I told him this:  Brahmins are like the sun and the moon. They bring happiness or sadness.  They are very powerful, like kings.  They know everything. Even the gods respect them!  If they're angry, bad things can happen.  They can even create whole new worlds!"

Krishna then told Pradyumna about a Brahmin named Durvasa.  Durvasa was a strange man. He was very tall and wore old clothes. He sometimes ate a huge amount of food, sometimes very little. He was unpredictable – sometimes happy, sometimes sad. He even lived in Krishna's house!

One day, Durvasa got angry. He burned everything in his room! Then he asked Krishna for some special food. After eating, he told Krishna to cover himself with the leftover food. He also covered Krishna's wife, Rukmini, with it. Then, he made Rukmini pull his chariot!  

People were shocked to see this!  They talked about how powerful Brahmins are.  Durvasa drove Rukmini roughly.  She fell down many times. Finally, Durvasa ran away. Krishna and his family followed him, begging him to forgive them.

Durvasa was happy that Krishna wasn't angry.  He said, "Krishna, because you respected me, I will give you great blessings!  Everyone will love you. Your good deeds will be remembered forever! Everything I broke will be fixed, even better than before!"  Durvasa also blessed Rukmini.

Krishna said to Pradyumna, "You see?  Respecting Brahmins brings good luck. That’s why I always honor them."

Krishna finished his story. He said, "So, Yudhishthira, always be kind and respectful to Brahmins.  It brings happiness and good fortune!"
