Rama and Lakshmana were living in the forest.  Lakshmana was very angry. He wanted to fight!

Rama said, "Lakshmana, our brother Bharata is coming to see us.  Why fight?  I don't want a kingdom if it means hurting Bharata.  Getting a kingdom is easy, but not if it's unfair."

Rama promised he only wanted a kingdom to help his brothers. He said he would give Lakshmana the kingdom if he wanted. He didn't believe Bharata was their enemy.  "Why would a brother fight a brother?" he asked.

Lakshmana felt very bad. He was ashamed.

Rama said, "Maybe it's even our father, King Dasaratha, who has come to take us home!"

Then they saw horses and an elephant!  It looked like a big army was coming.  But Rama didn't see his father's special umbrella.

Bharata, their brother, was leading the army.  He told his soldiers to stay far away from Rama's home in the forest. He wanted to be kind and respectful.
