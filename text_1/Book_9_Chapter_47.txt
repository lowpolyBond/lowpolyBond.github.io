King Janamejaya was amazed by the story of Skanda's special ceremony.  He said, "This story is wonderful! I feel so much better after hearing it!  But I want to hear another story.  Tell me about how the god Varuna became the king of all the water!"

Vaishampayana said, "Long, long ago, in the very first age of the world, all the gods went to Varuna. They said, 'Varuna, just like Indra is the king of the gods, you should be the king of all the rivers and oceans!'  Varuna said, 'Okay!'"

"So, the gods held a big ceremony and made Varuna the king of all the water. Then they all went home.  Varuna protected all the water, just like Indra protected the gods."

"Then, there was a problem! Agni, the god of fire, disappeared! He hid inside a Sami tree because he was scared of a curse. All the gods were worried.  They went to Brahma, the creator god, and said, 'Agni is gone! We need fire!'"

King Janamejaya asked, "Why did Agni hide? And how did the gods find him?"

Vaishampayana said, "Bhrigu, a powerful sage, cursed Agni.  So Agni, scared, hid himself in a Sami tree. The gods, led by Indra, searched everywhere. Finally, they found Agni inside the tree! They were so happy! Agni had become an eater of everything, because of the curse."

"Then, Baladeva, a very wise hero, went to many special places. He bathed in the holy waters at Brahmayoni, where Brahma created the world. Then he went to Kauvera, where Kuvera, the god of wealth, became powerful through hard work and prayers. The gods made him king. Kuvera also got a magical flying chariot!"

"Baladeva bathed there and gave away lots of treasures.  Then he went to another place called Vadarapachana.  It was a beautiful place with lots of fruit and flowers, all year round!"
