The sun was setting.  It was a sad day. We had fought a big battle.  Many of our best fighters were hurt.  Many were dead. We were covered in blood. We walked slowly back to our camp, very sad.

The sky turned dark.  Jackals cried sadly.  The sun looked red, like a lotus flower. It was getting dark. All the shiny swords and shields looked dull in the fading light.

The battlefield was a mess.  Dead elephants lay everywhere. They looked like giant hills.  Broken chariots were scattered around.  Many brave soldiers were dead.  Their horses and chariots were broken too.

It was awful. Dead soldiers lay on the ground. They had beautiful clothes and shiny armor, but now they were just bodies.  Dogs, jackals, and birds were eating the dead.  Scary creatures called Rakshasas and Pisachas were there too. They laughed and ate the dead bodies.

There was a river of blood. It was hard to cross.  The river was made of blood, broken chariots, and dead bodies.  It was a terrible sight.

The scary creatures ate and drank from the river of blood.  It was a scary and sad place.

We slowly left the battlefield. We saw Abhimanyu, a very brave warrior. He lay dead. He was a great fighter, but now he was just a body.  It was very sad.
