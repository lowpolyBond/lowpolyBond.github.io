Krishna, the best warrior ever, got into his amazing chariot.  Two strong teams of horses pulled it!  The chariot was golden, like the morning sun.  His special flag, with Garuda the eagle on top, flew high.  Arjuna and Yudhishthira, the Pandava brothers, jumped in beside him.  They looked like gods!

Krishnaâ€™s chariot zoomed off, super fast!  They quickly caught up with Bhima, another Pandava brother, who was also rushing to battle.  But Bhima was so strong, even Krishna couldn't stop him!

Bhima sped to the river. He saw Vyasa, a wise old man, sitting with other wise men.  Near them sat Ashwatthama, Drona's son, looking sad and covered in dust.

Bhima pointed his bow at Ashwatthama and shouted, "Stop!"

Ashwatthama was scared! He saw Bhima and the Pandavas coming.  He was really worried.  He remembered a special magic weapon his father gave him.  He picked up a blade of grass!  He whispered magic words, and the grass turned into a powerful, fiery weapon!  "This will destroy the Pandavas!" he shouted angrily, and threw the fiery weapon.  It looked like it could burn the whole world!
