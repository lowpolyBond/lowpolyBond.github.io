The Pandava brothers were walking.  Draupadi, their wife, got very tired.  She wasn't used to walking so far!  A big hailstorm made her even weaker.  She fell down, shaking like a little tree.

Nakula, one of the brothers, rushed to help. "Draupadi is very tired," he told Yudhishthira, the oldest brother.  "She needs your help."

Yudhishthira was very sad.  He picked Draupadi up and held her close. "She's used to comfy beds, not the cold, hard ground!" he cried. "Because of me, she's suffering.  I gambled away our home and now she's walking through the forest!"

Then, some wise priests came.  They chanted special words to help Draupadi feel better.  The brothers gently touched her and fanned her with leaves. Soon, Draupadi felt much better.  They made her rest on soft deerskin.  The twin brothers, Nakula and Sahadeva, gently rubbed her feet.

Yudhishthira worried about the long, snowy mountains ahead. "How will Draupadi climb them?" he asked Bhima, the strongest brother.

Bhima smiled. "I'll carry all of you!" he said. "Or, we can ask my son, Ghatotkacha. He's super strong and can even fly!"

Bhima thought of Ghatotkacha.  Whoosh!  Ghatotkacha, a powerful Rakshasa (a kind of magical being), appeared! He bowed to everyone.  "I'm here to help!" he said. Bhima hugged his son happily.  They knew they could face the mountains now!
