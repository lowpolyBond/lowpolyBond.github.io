Duryodhana and his brothers were captured by some powerful Gandharva warriors.  Arjuna, a very strong Pandava warrior, freed them.  He told the Gandharva leader, "Let my brothers go free!  They shouldn't be treated badly while the Pandavas are alive."

The Gandharva then explained, "We found the Pandavas and their family in trouble. We wanted to see them." Duryodhana felt so ashamed, he wished the ground would swallow him up!  The Gandharvas gave Duryodhana and his brothers back to Yudhishthira, the Pandava king.

Duryodhana was so upset! He said, "I was captured by my enemies, and *they* freed me! It would have been better to die fighting than be saved by them.  I've lost my honor!"

He decided to go without food and die. He told his brothers and friends, "Go home. I won't go back to Hastinapura (their city).  I'm too ashamed."

He asked Dussasana, his brother, to be king instead.  Dussasana cried and begged him not to die.  "I can't be king without you!" he sobbed.

Karna, their friend, saw them crying and said, "Stop!  Crying won't help! The Pandavas just did what was right. Don't make your enemies happy by being sad.  Your brothers are heartbroken. Get up, and go home!"
