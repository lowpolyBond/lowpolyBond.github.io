King Yudhishthira asked his grandfather Bhishma a question.  "Grandfather," he said, "sometimes people who are very religious eat leftover food from special ceremonies. This food might have meat and wine. They do this to have children and go to heaven. Is this right?"

Bhishma answered, "If people eat this food without doing the right ceremonies and prayers, it's not good. They are doing wrong. But if they do the ceremonies and pray, and only eat it hoping for children and heaven, they might go to heaven, but only for a while.  When their good deeds run out, they'll come back."

Yudhishthira asked another question. "People say not eating is a very good deed, a kind of penance. Is that true?"

Bhishma said, "Many think not eating for days, weeks, or months is a good deed. But truly good people know it's not.  It actually stops you from learning about yourself.  The best penance is to be kind and humble to everyone.  It's very hard, but it's the best kind of penance."

Bhishma explained that this best penance is like always not eating, always being pure, and always worshipping God.  "This person is always kind, always a vegetarian, and always happy," he said. "They are like they are always eating the best food, and are always welcoming guests!"

Yudhishthira wondered, "How can being kind be like not eating or always being pure?"

Bhishma smiled.  "If you eat only twice a day, at set times, that's like always fasting.  If you're always honest and wise, and only spend time with your wife when it's right, you're pure. If you only eat meat from special ceremonies, you're a vegetarian. By being generous and never sleeping too much, you're always awake and pure.  And if you feed your family and guests *first*, then eat, it's like eating the best food ever. You get to heaven that way!  It's like youâ€™re always sharing the good food from special ceremonies with everyone, and that makes you very blessed!"

Bhishma said that people who do this kind of penance are very lucky.  They have happy families, and when they die, they go to a wonderful place.  Gods and beautiful spirits even visit their homes!
