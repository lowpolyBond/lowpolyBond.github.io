Once upon a time, a sad family lived in a village.  A scary monster wanted to eat the father!  The father and mother cried.  Their daughter felt very sad too.

"Why are you so upset?" she asked. "I'll help!  You have to leave me behind, but please, save yourselves. People want children to help them, right?  Think of me as a raft, helping you cross a dangerous river.  A child protects their parents, that's what being a child means. My leaving will also help our ancestors. But my little brother is too young, he'll be alone if you die.  If you and my brother die, no one will do the important family rituals. I’ll be all alone, so sad and lost. But if you live, the family will go on.  A son is important, a wife is a friend, but a daughter... sometimes causes trouble. So please, save yourselves.  Even if it means leaving me."

The daughter cried too, imagining a sad life alone. She said, "If you go, I'll be very sad and alone. But it’s ok, if you live, I'll be happy even in Heaven!"

The parents cried even more.  Their little son, who was very young, saw them crying. He giggled and said, "Don't cry, Papa! Don't cry, Mama! Don't cry, Sister!" He picked up a blade of grass. "I'll kill the monster with this!" he said, smiling.

Everyone stopped crying for a moment.  Then a wise woman named Kunti came.  Her kind words gave them hope, like magic!
