King Dhritarashtra was walking when he met three brave warriors: Kripa, Ashvatthama, and Kritavarma.  They were very sad.

"King," they said, "Your son Duryodhana and his army are gone.  Only we three are left alive.  Everyone else died in the big battle."

Kripa spoke to Queen Gandhari, "Your sons fought bravely. They died like heroes.  They’re in a wonderful place now."  He explained that warriors who die in battle go to a special place in the sky.  It’s the best way for a warrior to die. Don't be too sad.

Then Kripa said, "We even attacked the Pandavas while they slept! We killed many of their soldiers, including the sons of Draupadi and King Drupada.  But the Pandavas are very strong.  They'll be angry, and they'll come after us! We have to go!"

Kripa, Ashvatthama, and Kritavarma asked the king and queen for permission to leave.  They were scared.  They bowed to the king and queen, and then rode away quickly.

Kripa went home. Kritavarma went to his own kingdom.  Ashvatthama went to see a wise man named Vyasa.  They were all afraid the Pandavas would find them.

Later, the Pandavas found Ashvatthama and fought him.
