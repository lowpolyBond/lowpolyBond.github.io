Once upon a time, in the land of the Mahabharata, there was a great storm!  Indra, the king of the gods, rode his amazing horse.  He was helped by Kadru, a powerful snake mother.

Indra told the clouds, "Pour your rain!"  The clouds were dark and full of lightning.  They roared and rumbled.  They poured rain, rain, rain!

So much rain fell, it looked like the world was ending!  The rain made huge waves.  The wind howled.  The lightning flashed. The sun and moon disappeared behind the thick clouds.  It was a wild, crazy storm!

The snakes were happy. They loved the rain!  The rain filled the whole earth.  Even underground, the water went!  The snakes and their mother swam to a safe island called Ramaniyaka.

And that's how the big storm ended.  The snakes were safe and sound!
