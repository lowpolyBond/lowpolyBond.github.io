Abhimanyu, Arjuna's brave son, fought like a fearless warrior!  He was so strong, he seemed like the god of destruction himself. He charged into the enemy army,  like a tiger grabbing a deer, capturing a soldier named Satyasravas.

Many enemy soldiers rushed to help, shouting, "I'll get him first!"  But Abhimanyu was too fast! He fought them all off easily, like a whale eating a whole school of little fish.  The enemy soldiers couldn't escape him, they kept coming even though they were losing. Their army was all mixed up and scared, like a boat in a big storm.

A powerful enemy, Rukmaratha,  tried to stop Abhimanyu.  He said, "Don't be afraid! I'll capture him!"  Rukmaratha shot many arrows at Abhimanyu. But Abhimanyu was even stronger. He quickly cut off Rukmaratha's bow and arms, then his head!

Many more enemy soldiers attacked Abhimanyu. They shot so many arrows, they covered him completely.  Duryodhana, the enemy king, was happy to see so many soldiers fighting Abhimanyu. He thought Abhimanyu was going to die.

But Abhimanyu had a special magic weapon!  He used it, and suddenly he seemed to be everywhere at once â€“ one moment he was one person, then a hundred, then a thousand!  He fought so bravely, he killed many of the enemy princes. He cut down their bows, horses, and even their heads.  It was like a storm knocking down a whole orchard of mango trees!

Duryodhana was scared now. He saw his army losing, so he joined the fight himself.  He and Abhimanyu fought fiercely, but Abhimanyu was wounded by Duryodhana's arrows, which forced him to stop fighting for a short while.
