King Dhritarashtra talked to Yudhishthira.  Yudhishthira was very sad.  He had lost many people in a big war.

Krishna, a wise friend, came to talk to him.  "Yudhishthira," Krishna said, "being sad all the time doesn't help those you've lost.  Instead, do good things!  Give gifts to priests, pray to the gods, and help poor people. You know what's right.  You've learned from wise people like Bhishma and Vidura. Don't be sad; be brave, like the kings before you.  Great heroes who die in battle go to a wonderful place.  What happened was meant to be."

Yudhishthira said, "Krishna, you're my good friend.  I want to go live quietly in the forest. I feel terrible for killing my grandfather and Karna, a great warrior.  I need to be forgiven for this."

Then Vyasa, another wise man, spoke.  "Yudhishthira, you know what's right! You've learned about being a good king.  Don't let sadness control you. You've heard all the teachings, but you're forgetting them! Don't be sad.  You know about doing good deeds and making things right."
