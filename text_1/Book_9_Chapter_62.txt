After a big battle, all the kings went back to their tents, happy and blowing their horns.  The Pandavas, with their friends Yuyutsu, Satyaki, Dhrishtadyumna, Shikhandi, and Draupadi's five sons, went to Duryodhana's tent.  It was empty and sad, like a playground after everyone went home.  There were only some women, eunuchs, and old advisors left.

Arjuna and his friends got off their chariots.  Krishna, Arjuna's best friend, helped Arjuna.  Krishna said, "Arjuna, put down your bow and arrows. I'll get off the chariot after you. This is for your safety."

Arjuna did what Krishna said.  As Krishna got off, the magical monkey on top of Arjuna's chariot disappeared!  Then, the chariot turned to ash!  It was like magic, but there was no fire!

The Pandavas were amazed. Arjuna asked Krishna, "Why did my chariot burn?"

Krishna smiled. "Your chariot was already damaged from the battle. It only stayed together because I was on it. Now that the battle is over, it’s gone back to dust.”

Krishna hugged Yudhishthira, the oldest Pandava brother, and said, "You won! You and your brothers are alive!  You beat your enemies!"  Then Krishna told Yudhishthira a secret:  "You promised to protect me, and I protected you and Arjuna in return."

Yudhishthira was amazed. He said, "Only you could have saved us from the powerful weapons of Drona and Karna!  You helped us win!"

After that, the Pandavas went into the enemy camp. They found lots of treasure – gold, jewels, and many other things!  They celebrated their victory with loud cheers.  Then they rested for a while.

Krishna said, “Let’s spend tonight outside the camp, for good luck.” So they went to the Oghavati River and slept there.

Then Krishna sent a messenger to Hastinapura, the capital city, to comfort Gandhari, the mother of the Kauravas, who had lost all her sons in the war.  He went to tell her sad news gently.
