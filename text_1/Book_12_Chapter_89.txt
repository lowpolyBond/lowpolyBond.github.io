King Yudhishthira wanted to be a good king.  He asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, for advice.

Bhishma said, "Don't let anyone cut down fruit trees!  The fruits and roots belong to the wise priests (Brahmins).  They need them to live.  After the priests have enough, others can share what's left. Never hurt the priests.

If a priest needs to leave your kingdom because he's hungry, give him food and a place to live. If he still wants to leave, talk to other priests. Ask them, 'This priest wants to leave! Who will guide my people?' If he *still* wants to go, just say, 'Goodbye, and good luck.'"

Bhishma continued, "A king should always give priests enough to live well, not just the bare minimum!  Farming, raising animals, and trading â€“ these are ways everyone can earn a living.  But learning about gods and doing religious things helps people go to heaven.  So, never stop people from learning about gods.  Kings are here to protect everyone and defeat bad people. Be brave and kind to your people!"

Bhishma said kings need to know what's happening everywhere in their kingdom.  They should use secret helpers to find out what people are thinking and saying.  A good king protects everyone, even from themselves.  A king should always ask himself, "What did I do wrong?  What can I do better?"  And a king should listen to what people think of him, both good and bad, even if it is from people far away or from his enemies.

Yudhishthira then asked, "How does one king become more powerful than another?"

Bhishma replied, "It's like in nature: strong animals eat weaker ones.  A strong king rules over weaker ones.  But a king must always watch his people and his enemies.  Don't be careless; enemies will attack!  Don't tax traders and farmers too much. Farmers feed everyone!  Your gifts help everyone, even the gods and magical creatures!  That's how you rule well and stay safe.  I'll tell you more later."
