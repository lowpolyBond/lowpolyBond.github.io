Long ago, in the land of Kuru, there was a big problem.  Bhishma, a very wise and strong warrior, had spoken.  Then, Drona, another wise man, spoke to Duryodhana, the king's son.

Drona said, "King Pandu, your father's father's father, was a good and kind king.  He gave up the throne to his older brother, Dhritarashtra, because he was a better ruler.  Pandu also gave the kingdom to Vidura, his younger brother, to help rule.  Pandu was happy to live in the forest with his wives.  Vidura was humble; he helped Dhritarashtra like a servant. Everyone followed Dhritarashtra, just like they had followed Pandu.  Bhishma helped with wars and peace, and Vidura managed the money and people.  Duryodhana, you are Dhritarashtra's son.  Why are you causing trouble?  Share the kingdom with your cousins, the Pandavas!  I taught you and them. Arjuna, one of the Pandavas, is like my own son, Aswatthaman. Do what Bhishma says: give the Pandavas half the kingdom.  Righteousness is the path to victory!"


Next, Vidura, a very wise and good man, spoke to Bhishma. He said, "Uncle Bhishma, you brought our family back from near-extinction. But Duryodhana is greedy and wicked. He's ruining our family!  He ignores his father's good advice.  If you don't stop him, our family will be destroyed!  Please, either bind Duryodhana and let the Pandavas rule, or take Dhritarashtra and me to live in the forest.  A terrible war is coming!"

Vidura was very sad. A princess, the daughter of King Suvala,  was also worried. She spoke to Duryodhana in front of everyone.  She said, "Duryodhana, you are wicked! You want to destroy the Kuru kingdom!  Dhritarashtra is king, and Vidura is his advisor. Why do you want the throne? Bhishma is alive and strong, yet he doesnâ€™t want to rule.  The kingdom belongs to the Pandavas, because of Pandu. They deserve it!  Listen to Bhishma, to Dhritarashtra, and to Vidura! Let Yudhishthira, the eldest Pandava, be king!"  She wanted to save her family from a terrible war.
