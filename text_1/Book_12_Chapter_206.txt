Long ago, a wise man named Manu told a story about the soul.  He said our soul is like a tiny thread inside a beautiful jewel.  Just like that thread can be inside different things – gold, pearls, or even a piece of clay – our souls can live in many different bodies.  We could be a cow, a horse, a person, or even a tiny bug!

What happens to us depends on what we do.  If we’re kind and good, we get good things in our next life.  It’s like a garden:  the soil gives each plant exactly what it needs to grow.  Our actions in this life decide what kind of life we have next.

Our actions come from what we want.  What we want comes from what we know. What we know comes from our soul. If we get rid of bad thoughts and actions, we can understand Brahma, which is like the biggest and best thing ever.

Brahma is even bigger than time itself!  It's like the biggest, strongest, and wisest being ever. People who only care about toys and games can't see Brahma.  Brahma is better than anything in this world.  It has no beginning and no end, so it never changes.  It's always happy and peaceful.

To find Brahma, we must stop wanting things all the time. That's the best way to live.  Prayers and rituals are good, but they’re like words spoken only with our mouths. Brahma is deeper than that. It's about understanding what's truly important inside ourselves.

Things like the sun have beginnings and endings.  But Brahma is always there, like the Earth, always.  People often can't find Brahma because they're too busy with other things, like wanting toys or power.

Brahma is too wonderful to describe. It’s like trying to catch the wind. We can only understand it with a very clear mind.  By being good and kind, and by thinking good thoughts, we can purify our minds. This helps us control our actions and desires. Then, we can finally find Brahma, the peaceful and unchanging place.

Our souls are always there, even when we can't see them. When we die, our souls go on.  They are like the wind guiding a boat safely to shore.  Just like the sun shines bright, then disappears, we can leave all our bad habits behind and find Brahma.

By understanding Brahma – the great, unchanging, and ever-lasting being – we become immortal and free from suffering, forever.
