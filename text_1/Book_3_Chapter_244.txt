Once upon a time, the Pandavas were living in the forest.  Arjuna, the strongest Pandava, was a super-skilled archer. One day, some magical beings called Gandharvas captured Duryodhana, the mean king, and his friends.

A Gandharva named Chitrasena explained to Arjuna why they did this.  "Duryodhana and his friend Karna came to the forest to laugh at you and your family while you were struggling," he said. "They wanted to see you sad.  The King of the Gods told me to capture them!"

Arjuna asked Chitrasena to let Duryodhana go.  He wanted to be kind to his brother, even though Duryodhana was very mean.  Chitrasena said, "Duryodhana is always boasting! He tricked both Yudhishthira (the Pandava king) and Krishna.  Let Yudhishthira decide what to do."

Everyone went to Yudhishthira.  The Gandharvas told him what happened. Yudhishthira, being a kind king, decided to free Duryodhana and his friends. He thanked the Gandharvas for not killing them, even though they could have easily won the fight.

Yudhishthira told Duryodhana, "Don't be so mean again! Be kind to your brothers. Go home!"  Duryodhana felt very ashamed and went back to his kingdom, feeling very sad and guilty.

The Pandavas were happy to be kind and forgiving.  The King of the Gods even brought the Gandharvas back to life who died fighting Duryodhana's men! Then the Pandavas continued to live happily in the forest, surrounded by kind people.
