Once upon a time, in a great battle, King Duryodhana saw his soldiers falling.  He got really angry! He shot many arrows at Bhima, a strong Pandava warrior.  Duryodhana broke Bhima’s bow!  But Bhima, quick as a flash, shot an arrow and hit Duryodhana hard in the chest.  Bhima was hurt but he held his spear tight.

Ghatotkacha, Bhima's son, was furious when he saw his dad hurt.  He roared!  Many Pandava warriors, like Abhimanyu, rushed to help, shouting and charging at King Duryodhana.

Drona, a wise teacher, saw Duryodhana in trouble. He yelled, "Protect the king! The Pandavas are attacking!"  Many warriors, including Kripa, Bhurisravas, and Salya, jumped in to help Duryodhana. A big fight started!

Drona himself shot many arrows at Bhima.  Then Duryodhana and Aswatthaman joined the fight against Bhima.  Bhima grabbed his heavy mace and stood strong like a mountain.  Many Kaurava warriors attacked him.

But then Abhimanyu and other Pandavas rushed to save Bhima. Nila, Bhima's friend, fought bravely against Aswatthaman, Drona’s son.  Nila was a great warrior, but Aswatthaman shot many arrows and hurt Nila badly.

Ghatotkacha, seeing Nila hurt, flew into a rage.  He used magic!  He made it seem like the Kaurava army was falling apart!  Soldiers saw their friends falling, even though it wasn't always real.  They thought they were losing and ran away!

Drona, Duryodhana, and all the Kaurava warriors seemed to be running too. Even though Drona and another warrior shouted, "It's magic! Don't run!", the soldiers were too scared. The Pandavas won that part of the battle, shouting with joy.  Ghatotkacha’s magic trick had worked! The Kaurava army ran away as the sun began to set.
