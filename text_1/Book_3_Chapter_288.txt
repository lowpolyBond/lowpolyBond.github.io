Ravana's son had died, and Ravana was furious!  He jumped into his shiny, jeweled chariot.  Lots of scary monsters with swords and weapons surrounded him.  He roared towards Rama and the monkey army!

Mainda, Nila, Nala, Angada, Hanuman, and Jamvuman, along with their monkey and bear friends, jumped in to fight. They used tree trunks as weapons and fought Ravana's monsters.

Ravana was powerful. He used magic!  Suddenly, hundreds and thousands of new monsters appeared from his body!  But Rama had a special weapon. He used it and defeated all the monsters.

Ravana tried magic again! This time, he made monsters that looked exactly like Rama and Lakshmana! Lakshmana shouted to Rama, "Kill those monsters!" Rama did.

Then, Matali, Indra's chariot driver, arrived in a bright, sunny chariot pulled by strong, golden horses. "Rama," he said, "use my chariot! Indra uses this chariot to defeat bad guys.  Use it to defeat Ravana!"

Rama wasn't sure. He thought it was more of Ravana's magic.  But Vibhishana (Ravana's brother) said, "It's real! Get in!"

Rama got in the chariot.  He and Ravana crashed into each other! The whole world seemed to hold its breath.  It was a HUGE fight!

Ravana threw a super-powerful spear at Rama, but Rama chopped it up with his arrows!  Then Ravana fired thousands and thousands of arrows and weapons! The monkeys got scared and ran.

Rama took out a special arrow. It was a super-powerful arrow, a Brahmastra!  When he aimed it, even the gods in the sky cheered!

Rama shot the arrow.  BOOM!  Ravana, his chariot, his horses, and his driver were all burned to ashes!  The gods were so happy!  Ravana was gone, his body completely destroyed.  Not even ashes were left.
