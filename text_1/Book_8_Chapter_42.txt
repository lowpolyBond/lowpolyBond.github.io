Once upon a time, in a great battle, Karna, a brave warrior, talked to his friend Shalya. Karna said, "I know Arjuna and Krishna are strong.  Shalya, you haven't seen them fight like I have. I'm not afraid to fight them! But I have a problem.  A long time ago, I was disguised as a priest. I wanted a special weapon from a powerful holy man named Rama.  But another god tricked me!  He turned into a worm and stung my leg while I was sleeping near my teacher. I couldn't move because I didn't want to wake him.  When my teacher saw the blood, he realized I wasn't really a priest. He was angry and cursed me! He said I would forget the weapon when I needed it most.  That's why I'm worried, because I've forgotten it! I have another weapon, though!  I’ll fight Arjuna bravely!"

Karna continued, "Arjuna is super strong. He shoots tons of arrows. He's like a raging ocean, but I will be the land that stops his arrows! I'll fight him! He's proud and strong, but I'll defeat him with my own powerful arrows. I'll cover him with so many arrows it'll be like a cloud blocking the sun!  I’ll stop him like the land stops the ocean!  I've faced tough warriors – even gods! I’m not afraid of Arjuna or Krishna!

But I do have another worry.  When I was younger, I accidentally shot and killed a cow. A priest was very upset. He cursed me, saying my chariot wheel would sink into the ground in battle, and I'd be scared.  I'm a little scared now! I tried to make things right with the priest, I offered him lots of cows, bulls, elephants, even slaves, but he still wouldn't forgive me! Finally, he said the curse would happen.  Shalya, I’ve told you all this because we're friends, but please, let's not talk anymore! Let's just fight!"
