After a big war, the Pandava brothers – Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva – went to see Gandhari.  Gandhari was very sad.  All her sons had died in the war. She was so angry at the Pandavas, she wanted to curse them!

But a wise man, a very holy Rishi, was there. He was super-fast and could see what people were really thinking.  He knew Gandhari was planning to curse the Pandavas.  He quickly washed himself in the river and rushed to stop her.

The Rishi told Gandhari, “Don’t curse them!  Remember what you told your son, Duryodhana, every day during the war: ‘Victory goes to those who are good and fair!’ You always said that, right? The Pandavas fought fairly, even though Duryodhana and his friends were very bad.”

Gandhari said, “I know, I know! My heart is just broken.  Duryodhana, Shakuni, Karna, and Duhshasana caused all this.  The Pandavas are not entirely to blame.  It’s just… Bhima hit Duryodhana below the belt in the fight. That’s what makes me so angry!”

The Rishi said, “Even in war, there are rules.  But even so, Bhima did what he had to do to win the war.  You should forgive them. Remember, you always taught kindness and fairness.”

Gandhari listened to the wise Rishi. She was still sad, but she knew he was right. She decided not to curse the Pandavas.  She was still heartbroken for her sons, but she understood that Duryodhana and his friends had started the war with their bad actions.  She decided to let go of her anger.
