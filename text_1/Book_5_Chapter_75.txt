Bhima, the strong warrior, spoke kind words.  Everyone was surprised!  It was like the mountains suddenly becoming light, or fire turning cold.

Krishna, Rama's brother, laughed.  He wanted to encourage Bhima.  "Bhima," he said, "you usually love fighting! You want to defeat the wicked Kauravas. You stay up all night, angry and restless. You shout and sigh, like a fire with smoke. You're alone a lot, breathing heavily, like someone carrying a big weight. People think you're crazy!"

Krishna continued, "You're like a huge elephant, smashing trees, angry and loud. You stomp the ground!  You like being alone, day and night. Sometimes you laugh suddenly. Sometimes you sit with your head between your knees, eyes closed.  You frown and bite your lip. You’re filled with anger!  Remember when you vowed to kill Duryodhana? You swore it as surely as the sun rises in the east and sets in the west."

"So why do you want peace now?" asked Krishna. "Are you scared?  When a warrior is afraid, everyone gets worried.  You see bad omens, even in your dreams.  You're acting weak, like a scared child. Your legs shake, your heart beats fast, and you're full of despair. People's hearts are like seeds blowing in the wind—always changing.  Your brothers are losing hope; they feel like they're drowning.  It’s strange to hear you talk like this, Bhima! Remember who you are, a strong warrior! Don't be sad.  A brave warrior earns what he has.  This weakness doesn't suit you!"
