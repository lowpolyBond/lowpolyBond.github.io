Once upon a time, in the land of Bharat, a wise king named Yudhishthira asked his grandfather, Bhishma, a very knowledgeable warrior:  "Grandpa, you said wanting too much stuff is bad.  Tell me more about not knowing things – ignorance!"

Bhishma said, "Someone who does bad things without knowing it's wrong, who doesn't think about what happens after they die, and who is mean to good people, gets a bad name. Ignorance makes people end up in a bad place.  It causes lots of sadness and danger!"

Yudhishthira asked, "Grandpa, tell me everything about ignorance! Where does it come from? How does it grow?  All the sadness in the world comes from not knowing better!"

Bhishma explained, "Things like being greedy, hating others, making bad decisions, feeling happy or sad, being too proud, wanting too much, getting angry, being lazy, wanting things you can't have, feeling jealous – all those things are really just different kinds of ignorance.

Think of it like this: ignorance and wanting too much are really the same thing!  They both cause the same problems. Wanting too much starts ignorance. As you want more and more, you become more ignorant. If you want less, you become less ignorant! They grow and shrink together.

Wanting too many things starts with making bad decisions.  Making bad decisions is always part of ignorance. Ignorance never goes away. It starts when you don't get what you want.  Wanting too much makes you ignorant, and ignorance makes you want too much! It's a circle.  Wanting too much causes all sorts of trouble.

So many good kings, like Janaka, Yuvanaswa, Vrishadarbhi, and Prasenajit, went to a good place after they stopped wanting too much.  You should be like them, Yudhishthira!  Don't want too much, and you will be happy now and forever!"
