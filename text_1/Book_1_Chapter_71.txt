Long ago, there was a king named Dushmanta.  He went to visit a wise hermit, Rishi Kanwa, but the hermitage was empty.  

A beautiful girl, as lovely as a goddess, greeted him.  She was dressed simply, like a hermit's daughter.  She offered him a seat and water, asking if he needed anything.

The king, who thought she was incredibly beautiful, asked who she was.  She smiled and said, “My name is Sakuntala, and I am Rishi Kanwa’s daughter.”

Dushmanta was surprised.  He said, “But hermits are very holy! How can they have a daughter?”

Sakuntala explained her story.  A long time ago, a powerful hermit named Viswamitra was so holy that even the king of the gods, Indra, was scared! Indra was worried Viswamitra's magic would make him lose his power.

So, Indra sent a beautiful fairy, Menaka, to distract Viswamitra. Menaka was so beautiful that she made Viswamitra forget his prayers.  They fell in love, and Sakuntala was born.  Then, Rishi Kanwa found her and raised her as his own daughter.


And that's how a king met a beautiful girl in a hermit's home.  It was a magical meeting, full of secrets and wonder!
