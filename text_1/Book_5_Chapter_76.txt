Krishna talked to Bhima. Bhima was very angry! He was like a strong horse ready to run.  "Krishna," Bhima roared, "You don't understand me! You know I'm strong! You know I love to fight! We've been friends for a long time!"

Bhima was upset because Krishna had scolded him. "Who else would talk to me like that?" he grumbled. "I'm Bhima! I'm super strong!"

Bhima boasted, "Look at the Earth and the Sky! They are huge and never move. If they crashed together, I could stop them with my arms! No one can escape my grip! Not even the Himalayas, the ocean, or even Indra, the King of the Gods, could save someone I’ve caught! I'll defeat all the enemy kings in battle! I’ve already beaten many kings before!"

Bhima continued, "You don't know how strong I am! You’ll see in the war! I'll crush elephants and soldiers! I'll defeat all the enemy warriors! I'm not scared! I'm strong and brave! I’m only being peaceful because I don’t want to destroy everyone!"

Bhima was angry but also wanted peace. He wanted to protect his family and the Bharata people.  He was a strong warrior, but he also wanted everyone to be safe.
