King Yudhisthira, the best of the Bharatas, asked the wise Markandeya a tricky question.  "I want to know," he said, "about the amazing goodness of women.  It seems so hard for wives to always be good and loyal to their husbands. They are like gods to them.  It also seems very hard for sons to be good to their parents.  Mothers carry babies for ten long months, then take care of them.  That's very hard work!  Even soldiers, who have to do sometimes cruel things, find it hard to be good.  Tell me about all this, wise Markandeya!"

Markandeya said, "King Yudhisthira, your question is hard, but I will answer. Some people think mothers are more important, some think fathers are. But mothers carry and raise children, which is very, very hard. Fathers also work very hard. They pray, they do difficult things, all so they can have children.  They worry about their children's future.  Both parents want their children to be good, successful, and happy.  A good son makes his parents proud. That son earns great respect and happiness.  As for wives, the best way for them to be happy and go to heaven is by being good and loyal to their husbands."
