Arjuna and Ashvatthama fought a huge battle!  It was like two bright stars clashing in the sky.  They shot fiery arrows at each other.

Arjuna hit Ashvatthama right between the eyes!  Ashvatthama looked like the sun with rays shining up.  Even Krishna and his friend were hurt by Ashvatthama's many arrows. They looked like two suns!

Arjuna was amazing! He shot so many arrows, it looked like a storm of arrows!  Ashvatthama was strong too, and he hurt Arjuna and Krishna with his own powerful arrows.  But Arjuna was even stronger! He shot more arrows.  He shot so many arrows that he cut down bows, quivers, arms, even the horses and chariots of the enemy!  He cut down heads like a farmer cuts grass!  He destroyed hundreds of chariots, horses, and elephants!

Then some brave elephant riders attacked Arjuna.  But Arjuna was too quick! He cut down the elephants, riders, and everything!

Ashvatthama kept fighting,  shooting more arrows. He covered Arjuna and Krishna in arrows, like clouds covering the sun. But Arjuna fought back and defeated Ashvatthama’s attack,  shooting all Ashvatthama’s soldiers.  Arjuna was so fast, nobody could even see his arrows fly.  Only the fallen soldiers were visible.

Ashvatthama then shot ten powerful arrows. Five hit Arjuna, and five hit Krishna!  They both were bleeding, and everyone thought they were dead!

A friend of Arjuna told him, "Don't let Ashvatthama escape! He's dangerous!"

Arjuna, very angry, attacked Ashvatthama again. He hit Ashvatthama's arms, chest, and legs with strong arrows.  He even cut Ashvatthama’s chariot ropes,  making Ashvatthama's horses run away with him!

Ashvatthama was hurt and tired. He knew he couldn't win, so he ran to join Karna's army. It was like getting rid of a bad illness!

With Ashvatthama gone, Arjuna and Krishna went back to battle, their chariot rumbling like thunder!
