A long time ago, in a faraway land, a wise man named Markandeya was talking to a bird catcher.  The bird catcher asked, "Wise man, they say there are five big elements: earth, water, fire, air, and sky. Can you tell me about them?"

Markandeya smiled. "Each element has special qualities," he said. "Earth has five: sound, touch, sight, smell, and taste. Water has four: sound, touch, sight, and taste. Fire has three: sound, touch, and sight. Air has two: sound and touch. And the sky has only one: sound."

"All things are made of these elements," Markandeya explained. "They mix together in different ways.  Things we can see and touch are called 'vyakta' (visible). Things we can't see, like our thoughts, are called 'avyakta' (invisible)."

He continued, "If you learn to control your senses – your eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and body – you can see the spirit inside you and everywhere around you.  It's like seeing your reflection in a mirror. But if you let your senses control you, you'll have troubles."

Markandeya used a clever story to explain. "Imagine your body is a chariot, your soul is the driver, and your senses are the horses. A good driver keeps his horses under control. If the horses run wild, the chariot crashes.  If you control your senses, you'll be happy. If you don't, you'll be sad."

He said, "Controlling your senses is like magic! It's the best way to become wise and peaceful.  It’s the key to happiness."  The bird catcher listened carefully, understanding the wise man's words.
