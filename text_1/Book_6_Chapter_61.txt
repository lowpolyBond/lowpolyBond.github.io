Once upon a time, in a great battle, Abhimanyu, Arjuna's son, was fighting bravely.  He was all alone, but he fought like a lion against five strong warriors!  He was super-fast, super-strong, and a great shot with his arrows.  He was the best archer there!

Arjuna, Abhimanyu's dad, roared like a lion when he saw his son fighting so well.  But then, lots of enemy soldiers surrounded Abhimanyu. He didn't get scared. He kept fighting, his bow shining like the sun as he shot arrow after arrow.

He hit Drona's son with one arrow, Salya with five, and knocked down another warrior's flag with eight more!  He even cut a big, golden spear in half with one arrow!  He was so good, he even shot down four horses pulling Salya’s chariot!

The enemy warriors – Bhurisravas, Salya, and others – were so scared of Abhimanyu's power, they couldn't fight him anymore!  Then, a huge army, twenty-five thousand strong, surrounded Abhimanyu and his chariot.

Drupada, the King of Panchala and Abhimanyu’s uncle, saw this. He rushed to help with his army.  He quickly shot arrows, killing lots of enemy soldiers!  He was a super strong archer, too!

Then, Samyamani’s son fought Drupada. He was very strong and brave.  He jumped off his chariot, wielding a sharp sword and a shield.  Drupada, however, was stronger! He smashed Samyamani's son's head with his mace, knocking him down.

When Samyamani saw his son fall, he got very angry! He attacked Drupada. Salya, another warrior, joined in. The battle raged on.  It was a very exciting, and very fierce, battle!
