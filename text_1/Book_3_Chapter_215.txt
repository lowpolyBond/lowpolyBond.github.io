Once upon a time, there was a bird catcher.  He accidentally hurt a wise holy man. The holy man was very angry! He gave the bird catcher a bad curse.

The bird catcher was very sorry. He begged the holy man, "Please forgive me! I didn't mean to hurt you!"

The holy man said, "My curse can't be undone. But I'll help you. You'll be a good person, always honoring your parents.  By doing this, you'll become very good inside and go to heaven.  Someday, the curse will end, and you'll be a holy man again."

The bird catcher was relieved. He helped the holy man and took him home. The holy man got better.

Later, the bird catcher talked to another holy man. He told him about the curse.

The other holy man said, "Everyone has good times and bad times. Don't be sad. You're a good person at heart.  Being a good person is more important than what kind of work you do.  You are still a holy man in my eyes!"

The bird catcher said, "It's true.  We all get sad sometimes.  Smart people don't let sadness control them.  We should all try to be good and do our best."

The other holy man said, "You are wise! You are a good person, and I am happy for you."

The bird catcher continued to be a good person, always taking care of his parents.  This is the end of his story. It teaches us that being kind and good is the most important thing, no matter what happens.
