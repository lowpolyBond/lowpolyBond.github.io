The battle raged!  Arjuna, a great warrior, heard the loud shouts and the rumble of chariots.  "Go faster!" he yelled to his charioteer, Krishna.

Krishna said, "I'm already going as fast as I can to where Bhima is fighting!"

Arjuna's chariot, shining like gold and pearls, sped towards the enemy.  The Kaurava army, with its elephants, horses, and soldiers, attacked!  It was a huge battle, like the gods fighting the demons!

Arjuna, strong and brave, fought like a hero. He shot his arrows so fast, they cut through enemy weapons, chariots, elephants, and even soldiers!  Everything fell down, like trees in a big storm.

Arjuna was so brave, he fought like a god, and quickly went to fight Karna, another great warrior.  He was unstoppable! The Kaurava soldiers rushed at him, but Arjuna was too strong. He defeated them all, easily shooting down hundreds of chariots and warriors!

Meanwhile, Bhima, another brave Pandava brother, fought too. He was like a powerful wind, sweeping through the Kaurava army. He crashed into the enemy, smashing everything in his path.  He killed thousands of soldiers and elephants, making a river of blood flow on the battlefield!  It was a scary, bloody river, hard to cross!

Duryodhana, the Kaurava king, was scared of Bhima. He ordered Shakuni, his uncle, to stop Bhima.  Shakuni, a clever warrior, fought hard, but even he couldn't defeat Bhima.  Bhima wounded him badly!  Shakuni was taken away by Duryodhana.

The Kaurava army ran away, scared by Bhima's power.  Duryodhana himself ran away too!  But then, the Kaurava soldiers, seeing Karna, the strongest Kaurava warrior, got their courage back.  They stood together, hoping Karna would save them.  The battle continued.
