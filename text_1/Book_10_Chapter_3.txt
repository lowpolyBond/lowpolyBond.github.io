Ashwatthama was very sad.  Kripa, a wise warrior, had given him good advice, but Ashwatthama was still heartbroken. He felt angry and decided on a terrible plan.

He said, "People think differently. Everyone thinks *they* are the smartest!  They praise their own ideas and criticize others'.  When things go well, friends agree. But when things are bad, they disagree.  Even the same person can change their mind, depending on how they feel. A doctor uses his smarts to help sick people. But others might not like his treatment.  What's smart today might not be smart tomorrow."

Ashwatthama continued, "We all try to do what we think is best, even if it's dangerous.  I have a plan to stop my sadness. God gave everyone a job. Brahmins are wise, Kshatriyas are strong warriors, Vaishyas are good with business, and Shudras serve others.  I'm a Brahmin, but I've always fought like a Kshatriya. If I don't avenge my father's death, I'll be ashamed! I have to be a warrior!"

"The Pancalas, our enemies, will be asleep tonight," Ashwatthama said.  "They'll be happy and tired after their victory. I will attack them while they sleep. I will kill them all, just like a fierce god destroying demons! I will be like a wildfire burning through dry grass, destroying everyone, including their leader, Dhrishtadyumna! Then I will fight the Pandavas and avenge my father. I will kill them all! Tonight, I will make the Pancalas suffer like Duryodhana and Karna and Bhishma did. I will crush Dhrishtadyumna like a bug. I will kill the sleeping Pancalas and Pandavas! This will make me happy and feel like I've done my duty!"
