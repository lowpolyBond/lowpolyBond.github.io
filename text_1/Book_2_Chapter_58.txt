The king woke up feeling sad. He called for his driver, Sumantra.  Sumantra was dusty and crying.  The king was worried about Rama.

"Sumantra," the king sighed, "Rama is in the forest!  He's sleeping on the ground, not in a comfy bed!  He used to have soldiers and elephants! Now, he's all alone with wild animals! How is poor Sita, and the little princes? How can they walk barefoot in the forest?"

Sumantra, all choked up, finally spoke.  "King," he said, "Rama bowed his head and asked me to tell everyone he was okay. He asked me to tell his mother Kaushalya to be strong and take care of the family. He told her to be kind to all the queens, especially Kaikeyi."

"He also told me to tell Prince Bharata to be good to everyone.  Bharata shouldn't become king yet; he needs to listen to the old king," Sumantra explained.  "Rama even said Bharata should treat his mother like his own mother."

Sumantra wiped his eyes. "Then Lakshmana was angry! He said, 'Why is Rama in the forest? The king listened to Kaikeyi, and now Rama is suffering! This is so unfair!'"

"Sita, she just looked sad," Sumantra said.  "She couldn't even speak. She just looked at Rama and cried."

The king listened, feeling even sadder. He wanted to hear more about Rama's life in the forest, to feel a little bit better.
