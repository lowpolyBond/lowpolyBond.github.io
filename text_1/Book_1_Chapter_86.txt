Once upon a time, there was a king named Yayati. He was the son of King Nahusha.  Yayati was a very good king.  He gave his throne to his youngest son, Puru.

Then, Yayati went to live in a forest.  He became a hermit! He ate fruits and roots. He was very, very patient. He prayed a lot and was very good to everyone.  He lived a simple life for a long, long time.

After many years, Yayati went to heaven!  Everyone was happy for him. But something sad happened. Indra, the king of the gods, sent Yayati back down to Earth!  Yayati didn't fall all the way. He stayed floating in the sky.

Later, Yayati went back to heaven! He went with some of his friends. A young prince named Janamejaya wanted to know why Yayati went to heaven and then came back.  A wise man named Vaisampayana told him the whole story.

Vaisampayana said Yayati lived a very simple life in the forest. He ate only fruits, roots, and sometimes a few seeds he found.  He did really hard exercises and prayed. He even lived for a whole year eating only air!  He was so good and so strong that he became famous all over the world! That's why he went to heaven.  But then he went back to heaven again.  His story teaches us that even if things are hard, being good and strong will always help.
