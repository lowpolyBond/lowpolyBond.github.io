Long ago, a wise teacher named Bhishma told a story about life and death.  He said everything, big and small, living and not living, is part of a big, big circle.

Imagine a tiny seed.  It's so small you can hardly see it. But inside, a whole big tree is waiting!  That's like us. We start small, but we have a special inner part, our soul, that is always there.

This soul is like a tiny magnet.  It pulls things towards it, like how a magnet pulls a piece of iron.  Our likes and dislikes, our hopes and dreams, they all get pulled towards our soul to make a new life.

Our soul is always there, even before we are born and after we die.  It's like the sun – it never disappears.  The world around us, even the sky and earth, didn't exist without our soul. It is what lets us experience life. 

But sometimes, our soul gets confused.  We want things, we make mistakes, and that's like a wheel spinning around and around. This wheel is our life, it goes round and round, always changing. Our body and senses are like the spokes, our actions are the outside rim, and our wants are the center. Our soul is in the middle, watching everything.

Imagine someone squeezing oil from seeds.  That’s how our actions, our good and bad deeds, shape our next life.  But our soul is never changed by them.  It's like the wind carrying dust; the wind stays clean, even though it carries dirty dust.

So, even though we might seem stuck in this spinning wheel, our soul is always separate and pure. Our soul is always who we truly are.

Bhishma said, if we can understand this, and learn to see our true selves, we can stop the wheel from spinning.  It’s like burning up bad seeds; if we let go of all our worries, we won't need to be reborn again!
