Once upon a time, Prince Janamejaya asked a wise man, Vaisampayana, a very important question. He wanted to know about a special kind of worship, a way to be truly close to God, called devotion to Hari (another name for God).

Janamejaya said, "Some people reach God through learning and studying.  But others reach God just by loving him with all their hearts.  Is loving God better than studying? Who started this way of loving God? How does it work?"

Vaisampayana said, "A long, long time ago, even before the world as we know it was made, God himself showed people this way.  It's very special, and only people with good hearts can truly understand it.  It started in a time called the Krita age, a long time ago, even before the time of Brahmas birth. It went from God to the first Rishis, to others and then, sadly, it was lost a few times, then found again.  Sometimes it was passed down from a Rishi (wise person) to another wise person.  It’s been passed down from Brahmas birth from the mouth, to his eyes, to his speech, to his ears.  Sometimes the great ocean even knew it, but it disappeared and was found again! It was even in the Rigveda, one of the oldest religious books. Finally, it was given to Manu, a great king, who shared it with everyone."

Vaisampayana continued, "God is like the ocean, and all knowledge is like waves. The waves come from the ocean, and eventually, they go back to the ocean.  All knowledge comes from God, and it all goes back to him."

Janamejaya then asked, "But why do some people follow other ways of worshiping?"

Vaisampayana answered, "People are different.  Some are good and pure (like Sattwa), some are driven by passion (Rajas), and some are lazy and dark (Tamas).  Only the good and pure, those filled with Sattwa, can truly understand and follow this path of devotion to God.  Only God can show someone this way. They can’t do it themselves."

Janamejaya asked one last question, "How can someone who always changes, become close to God?"

Vaisampayana replied, "By stopping all selfish actions, by being completely good and pure, by focusing on good things.  This path of devotion, this loving God with all your heart, is the same as the wisdom found in many old books. It's a very hard path, not many people can follow it, it takes a very pure heart.  Only those with good hearts can understand it, and only God can guide them."  He finished by saying, "God created the universe. He is everywhere, in everything."


And so, Janamejaya learned about the special way to love and worship God, a path that’s been passed down through time, and only those with pure hearts can truly understand.
