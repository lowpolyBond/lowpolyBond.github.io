One morning, as the sun peeked over the hills, lots of important people gathered outside the palace.  There were priests, army leaders, and rich merchants. They were all there to watch Rama become king!

It was a special day, perfect for a king's crowning.  The priests brought shiny golden bowls filled with water from special places â€“ rivers, lakes, even the ocean! They also brought a beautiful throne and a fancy chariot with a tiger skin seat.  There were flowers, honey, and yummy butter too.  Pretty singers and musicians were ready to play.  A big, strong elephant and a beautiful white horse were waiting, all decked out for the ceremony.  Everything was ready!

But King Dasaratha wasn't there yet! Everyone waited and waited.  "Who will tell the king we're here?" they wondered.  "The sun is up, but the king hasn't come!"

Just then, Sumantra, the king's trusted helper, arrived.  "I'll go get Prince Rama," he said. "Then I'll ask the king why he's late."

Sumantra went to the king's room.  He politely woke him up.  "Your Majesty," he said, "the people are waiting! The priests, the army, everyone is ready for Rama's coronation!"

The king woke up. "Quickly!" he said to Sumantra. "Bring Rama here at once! Don't delay!"

Sumantra hurried to Rama's palace.  It was amazing!  It was bright white, like a snowy mountain, and sparkling with jewels.  Peacocks and other beautiful birds lived there. People from faraway lands were arriving with gifts.  A huge, gentle elephant named Shatrunja was waiting to carry Rama.  There were horses and chariots ready too, and lots of artists and singers.

Sumantra passed through all the happy people, finally reaching Rama's room.  He went inside, and there he found Rama, ready to become king.
