King Dhritarashtra was very sad.  He said, "A poor man is suffering terribly!  Where does he find any joy?  Where does he live? How can we help him escape his fears?"

Vidura, a wise man, explained, "Think of the world as a scary jungle.  This man's life is like being lost deep inside.  The wild animals are his sicknesses.  A giant woman in the jungle is Old Age, taking away his strength and beauty.

His body is like a deep pit.  Time, a huge snake, lives in that pit and will eventually swallow everyone.  The vines holding the man down are his desire to live.  A big elephant with six faces – representing the six seasons – walks towards a tree at the edge of the pit.  Each step is a month of the year.

Little rats and snakes – the days and nights – are slowly chewing the tree, making the man's life shorter.  The bees are his desires, and the sweet honey they make is the pleasure he gets from those desires.

Wise people understand all this.  They know that life is like this, and they learn to escape its dangers."
