Once upon a time, a wise teacher named Vyasa told his son a very important secret about the soul.  He said our soul is like a skilled driver.  The driver uses strong horses – these are our senses, like seeing, hearing, and smelling – to go where it wants. The mind is like a sixth, very important horse.

The things we see and hear are important, but the mind is even more important.  Our understanding is better than our mind, and something called "Mahat" is even better than our understanding.  Above Mahat is something even greater, called the Unmanifest, and above that is Brahma, the highest of all.  Brahma is the greatest thing there is.

This amazing Brahma lives inside everyone. But most people can’t see it. Only special people called Yogins, who are very wise and calm, can see Brahma. They do this by calming their minds and understanding how they think.  They think about what they are thinking about and who is doing the thinking. They stop wanting things and focus on Brahma. By doing this, they become immortal.

If someone only cares about their senses and doesn't think about right and wrong, they miss out on this amazing truth.

A Yogin who is pure at heart becomes very happy. It’s like being totally still, just like when you sleep deeply and don’t dream. They’re like a steady flame, always calm.  If they focus on their soul, they can see the amazing Brahma inside.

Vyasa said this secret is like the most important part of all the holy books. You can’t just read it and understand it; you need to feel it in your heart. He said he discovered this secret like finding hidden treasure. It’s very precious!

But Vyasa said this secret is only for very special people: people who are calm, kind, and have studied hard.  It's not for people who argue a lot or are unkind.  It's more valuable than all the riches in the world!

Vyasa asked his son if he wanted to hear more about this amazing secret.  He said he was ready to answer any questions his son had. The wise teacher was ready to share even more wisdom.
