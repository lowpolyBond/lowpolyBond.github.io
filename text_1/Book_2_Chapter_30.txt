Rama was worried about the forest.  It was dangerous! He didn't want Sita to come with him.  But Sita loved Rama very much. She said, "Rama, if my father knew you were a little bit scared, he wouldn't have let me marry you!  Don't be sad! I'll go with you. I'll be just like Savitri, who stayed with her husband, Satyavan. I only love you. I will never look at anyone else!  Let's go!"

Sita told Rama, "I'll follow you anywhere!  Whether you're a king or living in a simple hut, I'll be with you.  The forest won't be scary with you.  Thorny bushes will feel like soft fur! Dusty storms will be like sweet-smelling perfume!  Sleeping on the ground will be like sleeping on a soft bed!  Any food you find will be delicious!  I won't miss my family â€“ you're all I need. I won't be a burden to you.  The forest will be heaven with you, but without you, even a palace would be hell."

Sita cried and hugged Rama.  Tears rolled down her cheeks like a river. Her face, usually bright and happy, looked sad.

Rama held Sita, and said, "My dear Sita, I don't want to go to heaven if it means leaving you! I'm not scared. But I wasn't sure you wanted to come. Now I know you do!  I won't leave you. I have to go to the forest because my father told me to.  It's important to obey our parents.  It's like a rule.   But seeing how much you want to come, I'm happy to have you with me!"

Rama said, "Let's get ready to leave. Give your beautiful jewels and clothes to the poor and the priests. Let's share everything we have with others before we go."

Sita was so happy! She gave away all her jewels and beautiful things to the poor and the priests.  She was ready to go with Rama to the forest.
