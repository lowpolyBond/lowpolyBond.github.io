Once upon a time, a very good chariot driver named Rituparna arrived in the city of Vidarbha.  The people told King Bhima. King Bhima invited Rituparna to stay.

Rituparna’s chariot made a loud rumbling noise as he entered the city.  This sound was so familiar!  The horses that belonged to King Nala, who lived in the city, loved the sound. It reminded them of their own master!

Princess Damayanti heard the rumbling too.  It sounded just like the loud roar of rain clouds. She thought, "That’s Nala’s chariot!  My dear Nala has returned!"

Damayanti was so happy she thought she would die if she didn't see him! She loved Nala very, very much. She said, "If I don't see my Nala today, I will be very sad."

Damayanti ran to the roof to look.  She saw Rituparna, but not Nala. She saw his chariot drivers, Varshneya and Vahuka.

Rituparna, a very nice king, met King Bhima.  Bhima welcomed him.  Rituparna looked around, but there was no big wedding ceremony. He said he had just come to visit.

King Bhima was puzzled.  He thought, "Why would such an important king travel so far just to visit me?" But he was polite and asked Rituparna to rest.

After Rituparna left, Damayanti still wondered about the chariot’s noise. She thought, "The sound was exactly like Nala's!  Did Rituparna learn to drive like Nala, or is it just a coincidence?"

Damayanti sent a messenger to find out if Nala was nearby.  She was still hoping to see her husband.
