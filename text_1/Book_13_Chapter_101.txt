Once upon a time, a wise king named Yudhishthira asked his advisor, Bhishma, "Where do bad people go who steal from priests?"

Bhishma said, "I'll tell you a story about a low-caste man, a Chandala, and a nobleman."

The nobleman saw a Chandala covered in dirt.  "You're old," he said, "but you act like a child! You're covered in dirt, but you worry about little drops of milk on your body!  Why are you cleaning the milk off?"

The Chandala replied, "A long time ago, some cows belonging to priests were stolen.  Milk spilled on some special plants. The priests who drank from those plants, and even the king who used those plants in a special ceremony, went to hell! Everyone who drank milk or yogurt from the king's palace went to hell too!  Even the stolen cows hurt the thieves' families with their milk!

"I was living nearby.  Some of that milk fell on my food when I was begging.  Because I ate it, I became a Chandala. The king who stole the cows had a terrible end.  Never steal from a priest!  That's why wise people don't sell those special plants. Anyone who buys or sells them goes to hell!  A priest who sells them becomes a greedy money lender and suffers greatly!  Pride is even worse.  Look at that skinny dog – it was a proud person in a past life! I was once very learned, but my pride made me eat bad food, and now I’m a Chandala."

The Chandala cried, "How can I become a good person again?"

The nobleman said, "Give your life to save a priest! Die fighting for a priest's belongings.  That is the only way!"

The Chandala did just that. He fought bravely and died protecting a priest's things.  He went to a good place.

Bhishma finished the story, "Always protect priests' things, my prince, if you want happiness forever."
