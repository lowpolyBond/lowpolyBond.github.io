King Yudhishthira asked, "Bhishma, how can someone become truly great and reach a wonderful place beyond our world?"

Bhishma, the wise old man, answered, "To reach that special place, you must live a simple life.  You must be kind and control your wants.  You should leave your home and see good things and bad things as the same.

Don't let anything tempt you. Never say mean things about anyone, even in your head!  Don't hurt any living thing. Be friendly to everyone.  Don't brag or get angry easily.  If someone is mean to you, be nice back.

When you ask for food, wait until everyone else has eaten.  Eat only enough to stay alive; don't want more. Be happy whether you get what you want or not. Don't wish for things most people want. Don’t complain about your food, whether it’s good or bad. Sleep and sit in quiet places, like under a tree or in an empty house.

Don’t show off your good deeds, and don’t hide what you do.  Be calm and peaceful.  Don't let good things or bad things bother you.  Say prayers often. Be quiet and happy.  See that everything changes – even your own body!  See that everyone comes and goes. Let go of wanting things. Eat whatever you find. Be calm and peaceful.

Control your anger, jealousy, and hunger.  Don’t let mean words hurt you. Be kind to everyone, good or bad.  This is the best way to live.  A truly great person lets go of everything they own and loves and doesn’t go back to the places they used to live. They think about being peaceful and kind. They eat whatever they find without asking.  They don’t get excited about good things.  This simple life will lead you to true peace. This is very hard for some people but it is the path to peace."
