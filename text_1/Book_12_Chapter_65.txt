Once upon a time, King Mandhatri asked the great god Indra, "What should a good king do?"

Indra said, "A king, like you, must be brave and kind.  He must take care of his people. He needs to make sure everyone has enough food to eat and lives peacefully.  A king must be fair and just to everyone. He should give to those in need.  A king protects his people, like a strong shield.  Fighting for your people is also very important."

Indra explained that kings should help everyone live good lives.  He said that other people—like farmers and priests—can only do their jobs if the king is doing his job well.  People who only care about themselves are like animals.  A good king makes them do what is right.

Indra continued, "Priests should follow the rules of their religion. If they don't, they should be punished.  A king must support the priests. They are very important! If a priest doesn’t do his job, the king shouldn't help him."

Then King Mandhatri asked, "What about the other people in my kingdom, the ones who aren't farmers or priests?"  He named many different groups of people.

Indra replied, "Even those who used to steal should be kind. They should respect their parents, teachers, and elders. They should also obey the king and follow the rules of good living. They should help others, and give to those in need, just like everyone else."

Mandhatri worried, "Some bad people pretend to be good."

Indra said, "When kings stop being good, everyone suffers.  In the future, many bad things will happen, but good kings will make things better. A good king is like a god, and the gods always respect good kings."

Indra told King Mandhatri that a good king always makes sure everyone follows the rules and does what is right.  Then Indra disappeared.

Bhishma, a wise old man, told King Mandhatri, "Remember what Indra said!  Follow the rules of your ancestors.  Be a good king, and you’ll make your kingdom strong and happy!"
