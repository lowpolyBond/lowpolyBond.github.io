Once upon a time, Draupadi, a very wise woman, gave Satyabhama some advice on how to keep her husband, Krishna, happy.  She said, "Satyabhama, to win your husband's heart, be kind and true.  There's no one more important than your husband. When he's happy with you, you'll have everything you want.  But if he's angry, you might lose it all."

Draupadi explained, "Your husband gives you everything – children, beautiful things, even a happy life. He gives you pretty clothes, comfy beds, and lovely smells.  Making him happy isn't easy, but a good wife always tries."

She continued, "Always love and respect Krishna.  Show him you care. Make him comfortable with nice seats, pretty flowers, and sweet-smelling perfumes.  Serve him well, so he knows how much you love him!"

"When you hear your husband coming home, be ready to greet him! Offer him a seat and wash his feet. If he asks a servant to do something, do it yourself! Let him see how much you care. And Satyabhama, never tell anyone your husband’s secrets.  If you tell your co-wives, and they tell Krishna, he'll be upset."

Draupadi also said, "Be nice to Krishna's friends.  Stay away from people who don't like him. Don’t be silly or noisy around others. Keep your secrets to yourself, even from your sons, Pradyumna and Samva. Be friends only with good women who love their husbands. Avoid women who are mean, drink too much, or are dishonest."

"If you do all these things, Satyabhama, you will be a good wife, and you and Krishna will be very happy.  Always worship and love your husband, wearing pretty things and smelling nice. This will bring you good fortune and happiness."
