King Dhritarashtra was worried.  "Sanjaya," he said, "I'm so upset! I heard Abhimanyu, Subhadra's son, fought all my army by himself! Tell me everything again!"

Sanjaya said, "It was a terrible battle! Abhimanyu, in his chariot, bravely shot arrows at Dhritarashtra's soldiers. He was super fast, like a ring of fire! He even hit Drona, Karna, Kripa, and many other great warriors!  He was everywhere at once, fighting bravely!"

Dhritarashtra's army was scared.  Drona, a very wise warrior, saw Abhimanyu fighting and said, "This young man is amazing! He could defeat us all, but he doesn't seem to want to."

Duryodhana, Dhritarashtra's son, was angry.  "Drona isn't killing Abhimanyu because they are friends," he said. "Arjuna, Abhimanyu’s father, was Drona’s student.  Attack him, everyone!"

Duryodhana's warriors, furious, attacked Abhimanyu.  Duhsasana, a very strong warrior, shouted, "I'll kill Abhimanyu right in front of the Pandavas!  Then the Pandavas will be so sad they'll all die!"

Duhsasana attacked Abhimanyu with many arrows. Abhimanyu fought back bravely, shooting twenty-six arrows.  They fought fiercely, their chariots circling each other.  The battlefield was noisy with war drums and shouts— it was a terrible, terrible battle!
