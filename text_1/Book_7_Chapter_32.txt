Once upon a time, in the great war of the Mahabharata, there were five amazing brothers, the Pandavas, who fought with their friend Krishna.  They were so strong, even the gods couldn't stop them!

Yudhishthira, the oldest brother, was the best. He was kind, fair, and always did what was right.  He was so good, he was like a prince from heaven!

Bhima was incredibly strong. He was as strong as Rama, a powerful hero from long ago, and even the god of destruction!

Arjuna was the greatest archer.  He never missed his target. No one on earth could shoot arrows like him!

Nakula and Sahadeva were also brave warriors. Nakula was handsome and polite, while Sahadeva was wise and clever.  They were like the twin gods, the Aswins!

Then there was Abhimanyu, Arjunaâ€™s son. He was amazing! He was brave like Bhima, strong like Yudhishthira, clever like Krishna, and handsome like Arjuna. He was the best of everyone!


King Dhritarashtra, the father of the Kauravas (the Pandavas' enemies), was sad. He wanted to know how Abhimanyu died.

Sanjaya, who could see everything happening in the war, told him. "Oh King," he said, "I will tell you, but be prepared for sad news."

The Kauravas made a giant circle of warriors to trap Abhimanyu.  Ten thousand soldiers surrounded him!  They were all strong and dressed in red.  Their leader was Duryodhana, and important warriors like Karna and Drona were also there. It was a huge army!

Then, a terrible battle began.  Abhimanyu fought bravely, but he was surrounded by many, many soldiers. The battle was fierce and scary.
