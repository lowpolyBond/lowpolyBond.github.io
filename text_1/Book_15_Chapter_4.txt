Once upon a time, a wise old man named Vyasa spoke to King Yudhishthira.  He said, "King Dhritarashtra, your uncle, is very old and sad.  He's lost his sons.  He wants to go live in the forest, like wise kings of the past.  Please let him go. Don't stop him."

Yudhishthira, a kind king, said, "Vyasa, you are like a father to me. I will do what you say."

Vyasa explained more. "Dhritarashtra is very old. He's at the end of his life.  It's the right thing to let him go peacefully.  Your father, King Pandu, always respected Dhritarashtra.  He was a good king, and you have always shown him respect too.  Dhritarashtra isn't angry with you. He just wants peace."

Vyasa then calmed Dhritarashtra's worries.  Yudhishthira agreed, saying, "Let it be so."

Vyasa left. Yudhishthira gently said to his uncle, "I will do what Vyasa said, and what you wish. I will also follow the advice of Kripa, Vidura, Yuyutsu, and Sanjaya.  They all care about our family. But first, Uncle, please eat something before you leave for the forest."
