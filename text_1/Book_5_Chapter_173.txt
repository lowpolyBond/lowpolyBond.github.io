Once upon a time, a great warrior named Bhishma told the king about the Pandavas' strong army.  He said, "The Pandavas have many brave fighters!  Rochamana is super strong, like a god in battle!  Kuntibhoja, Bhima's uncle, is also amazing with his bow and arrow. He knows all about fighting.  And Ghatotkacha, Bhima's son, is a powerful leader! He’s great at magic tricks and loves to fight. He and his friends, the Rakshasas, will fight bravely.

Many other strong warriors are fighting for the Pandavas, like Vasudeva.  They are all incredibly skilled. The Pandavas' army is also led by Arjuna, who’s as strong as the god Indra!  This whole army is super powerful and ready to fight!"

Bhishma continued, "I will fight against them, even against the amazing warriors Vasudeva and Arjuna, who are like the sun and the moon! I will fight all of Yudhishthira's army.

But there’s one person I won't fight: Sikhandin. A long time ago, Sikhandin was a woman.  I made a promise to always be good, so I won’t fight a woman. I’ll fight everyone else, but I can't bring myself to fight the sons of Kunti!"
