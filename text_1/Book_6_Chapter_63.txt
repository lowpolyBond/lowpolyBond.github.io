Once, in a great battle, a giant elephant army was defeated.  Duryodhana, the bad guy, ordered his whole army to attack Bhima, a very strong Pandava warrior.  

Imagine a HUGE wave of soldiers, elephants, and chariots – so many you couldn't even count them all! It was like a giant, angry ocean!  Bhima stood strong against this huge wave, like a rock in the sea! He was amazing!  

He used his big, heavy mace (a kind of club) to fight them all off. His brothers, cousins, and friends fought bravely beside him.  Bhima was so strong, he smashed through the enemy army like a wildfire. He knocked soldiers off their chariots and crushed them under his feet.  The battlefield was covered in dead bodies. Bhima’s mace was covered in blood! It was a terrifying sight!

Everyone was scared of Bhima. Just by looking at him, soldiers ran away! He was unstoppable!  

Then another brave warrior, Satyaki, rushed to help. Satyaki was so brave that the enemy soldiers trembled before him. Even when many arrows hit him, he kept fighting!  More and more enemy soldiers attacked, but they still couldn't stop him.   Then, Somadatta's son saw his army being defeated and charged at Satyaki to fight! And so the battle raged on.
