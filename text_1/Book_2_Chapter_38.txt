King Dasaratha was very sad.  He saw Sita, Rama's wife, dressed in simple bark clothes like a hermit.  Everyone thought it was terrible.  They blamed the king.

Dasaratha felt awful. He talked to his wife, Kaikeyi.  "Sita shouldn't be dressed like this!" he said. "She's a princess! She deserves to be happy. She hasn't done anything wrong. I never said she should live like a hermit in the forest.  I’m dying inside.  Giving you those wishes was a terrible mistake. It’s killing me.  Rama didn't hurt you, and neither did Sita!  You sent Rama away for no reason!  You're going to be punished for this! You made Rama go to the forest dressed like a hermit. Now you want Sita to go the same way!"

Dasaratha was so upset he fell to the ground.

Rama saw his father’s pain.  He was about to leave for the forest. He said, “Father, my mother Kaushalya will be very sad without me. She's old and kind.  Please take care of her.  She’s never known sadness.  Please make sure she’s okay while I’m gone.”
