Krishna spoke to Arjuna, who was ready to fight Karna.  "Arjuna," Krishna said, "this battle has lasted seventeen days!  Your army was huge at the start, but many brave soldiers, elephants, and horses have been lost.  The Kauravas also lost many, but you, Arjuna, have fought so bravely!  You protect our army—the Pancalas, Matsyas, Karushas, and Cedis. They’ve fought bravely thanks to you.

No one can defeat the Kauravas in battle *except* you!  And no one can beat the Pandavas' mighty warriors—again, except you! You’re so strong, you could even defeat all the gods, demons, and humans combined!  Who else could defeat Bhagadatta, that powerful king? Only you, Arjuna!  The whole Kaurava army is only strong because you fight them. It's because of you that Dhrishtadyumna and Shikhandi were able to defeat Bhishma and Drona.

Bhishma and Drona were incredibly strong warriors, like the gods themselves.  Who else could beat *them*? Only you! You defeated so many soldiers, elephants, horses, and powerful kings. You even defeated the Govasas, Dasamiyas, Vasatis, and many other brave warriors! The Tusharas, Yavanas, Khasas, and many more fierce fighters—even together with the Kurus—couldn’t beat you. Who else could stand against the huge Kaurava army?  Only you protected the Pandavas, and helped them win many battles!

Abhimanyu defeated Jayatsena and ten thousand elephants! Then Bhima crushed even more elephants and warriors. But even with so many losses, the Kauravas kept fighting, until you and Bhima stopped them.  Bhishma was a great warrior, too. He shot many arrows and killed countless warriors and elephants – a hundred thousand in all!  He fought for ten days! But even Bhishma, strong as he was, was defeated by Shikhandi because he had you, Arjuna, on his side.

Drona was another mighty warrior. He fought for five days, but Dhrishtadyumna finally defeated him—only because you held back the rest of the Kaurava army! You were the one who kept the Kauravas busy, so Drona could be defeated.  You also defeated King Jayadratha. Everyone was amazed, but for me, it was just another example of your strength!  Even if you fought the whole Kaurava army for a whole day, they wouldn't stand a chance!

Now, Bhishma and Drona are gone. The Kaurava army is weak, like the sky without the sun, moon, and stars.  Only five strong warriors are left: Ashvatthama, Kritavarma, Karna, Shalya, and Kripa. Defeat them, Arjuna!  Then give the kingdom to Yudhishthira.  He deserves to rule the entire world!

Arjuna, if you feel sorry for Ashvatthama because he was Drona's son, or for Kripa, or Kritavarma, or even your uncle Shalya, that's okay. But you *must* kill Karna. He is the reason your family suffered. He's the reason your mother and siblings almost burned to death! He is the reason for the dice game, he is the reason for this whole war! Duryodhana relies on him, but Karna is evil. He constantly boasts that he will defeat all of you.

Remember when Abhimanyu fought bravely, and Karna, cowardly, hurt him?  Remember Karna's terrible words to Krishna, saying you were all dead? He said wicked things about your family, and laughed when Abhimanyu was killed. Kill Karna today, Arjuna. Your arrows will avenge all his evil deeds!  Let your arrows bring Karna down, and let everyone see his defeat! Let his standard fall to the ground! Let his chariot be broken!  Let Suyodhana despair!

Karna is powerful, yes. He’s killing your allies, the Pancalas, even though they keep bravely fighting.  But they will not be saved unless you defeat Karna. He is like a terrible disease that will destroy the Pandavas and everyone else if you do not stop him.  Only you can defeat Karna and win this war, Arjuna. Do it today, and gain great glory!"
