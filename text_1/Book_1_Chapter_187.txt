Once upon a time, the five Pandava brothers were traveling.  They met a wise holy man and followed his advice.  They went to the kingdom of King Drupada. They were very clever and disguised themselves as poor students. Nobody knew who they really were!

King Drupada wanted his daughter, Draupadi, to marry a very special hero.  He secretly hoped Arjuna, one of the Pandavas, would win her.  So he made a super-strong bow.  Only the strongest warrior could bend it!  He hung a target high in the sky.  He announced, "Whoever can string this bow and hit the target will marry my daughter!"

This was called a Swayamvara â€“ a special contest to choose a husband.  Kings from faraway lands came.  Even Duryodhana and his Kaurava cousins came, hoping to win Draupadi.  The city was filled with exciting music, beautiful decorations, and lots of people!  It was a big party!

The Pandavas also went to the contest. They sat quietly among the crowd.  They watched as the kings tried to bend the impossible bow.  Nobody could do it!

Then Drupada's son, Dhrishtadyumna, explained the rules again. He said whoever could string the bow and hit the target with five arrows would marry his sister Draupadi.  He described all the brave kings and princes waiting to try.  He made sure everyone knew who the powerful competitors were!

What happened next?  That's a story for another time!
