Once upon a time, a powerful god named Indra wanted to learn a secret.  He disguised himself as a poor, old holy man. He traveled in a rickety cart to see a powerful demon named Samvara.

Indra asked Samvara, "How did you become the leader of all the demons?"

Samvara smiled. "It's simple," he said.  "I always respect wise teachers, the Brahmanas. I listen carefully to their teachings.  I never disobey them. I treat them with kindness and show them great honor.  I always ask them questions. I learn from them. Even if they are tired or sleepy, I stay awake and help them.  They teach me so much wisdom, it's like bees filling a honeycomb with sweet honey!  I always follow their advice, and I always remember I am not as wise as they are.  That's why I'm so successful!"

Samvara then told Indra about his father. His father had asked the moon-god, Soma, how Brahmanas (wise teachers) become so successful.

Soma answered, "Brahmanas succeed through hard work and studying. Their greatest power is their knowledge and wisdom, not their strength like a king's army. A Brahmana must study hard, even if it means leaving home.  A king who won't fight, and a Brahmana who won't travel to learn, are both like food for the earthâ€”it swallows them up!  Pride is bad, and a Brahmana should never stay home, learning nothing."

Samvara's father learned this lesson and started respecting Brahmanas. Samvara did the same.

Indra heard all this and realized the secret to power was respecting wise people. He started respecting the Brahmanas too!  And that's how he became the great king of the gods!
