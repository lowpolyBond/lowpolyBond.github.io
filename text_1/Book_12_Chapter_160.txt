King Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandpa, what's the best way to be a good person and live a good life?"

Bhishma smiled.  "My dear grandson," he said, "there are many good things to do, but the very best is *self-control*."

"Self-control?" Yudhishthira asked.

"Yes," Bhishma explained. "It means controlling your feelings and actions.  It's like having a strong inside that guides you to do what's right.  For a wise person, it's the most important thing."

Bhishma told Yudhishthira that self-control means being kind and forgiving. It means being patient and never hurting anyone.  It means being honest and fair. It means being humble and not bragging.  It means being happy with what you have, and not being greedy.

"It's like being a calm, still ocean," Bhishma said. "A big and powerful ocean, but always calm and peaceful, never easily upset."

Bhishma said that a person with self-control is always happy, inside and out.  They sleep well and wake up feeling good.  They don't worry about little things, and they don't cause trouble for others.  A person without self-control is always unhappy and gets into trouble.

"Self-control is like a magic key," Bhishma continued. "It unlocks a happy life here on earth, and a wonderful life after we die."

He explained that true self-control means being friendly to everyone, and not being jealous or mean. It means being wise and understanding, and living a good life.  It doesn't mean running away to live in the forest, although that can help some people.  It means living a good life wherever you are, in a city or in a quiet place.

Bhishma said a person with self-control is like a bird flying silently in the skyâ€”you barely even notice them. They live a peaceful life, and everyone respects them. They'll be happy now, and they'll have a wonderful life later.  They'll even go to a beautiful place after they die!

Yudhishthira was very happy to hear Bhishma's words. He felt like he had just drunk the sweetest nectar! He asked more questions, and Bhishma happily answered them all.
