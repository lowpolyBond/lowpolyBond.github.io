King Dhritarashtra was very worried.  He said, "Sanjaya, the Pandavas and their friends are incredibly strong! They're all brave warriors ready to fight to the death.  The Pandavas have powerful allies â€“ the kings of Panchala, Kekaya, Matsya, and Magadha!  And Krishna, the most powerful of all, is helping them win!

Satyaki is a super archer, even better than Arjuna!  Dhristadyumna, the prince of Panchala, is another amazing warrior. He's a master with all kinds of weapons!

I'm terrified of Yudhishthira, Arjuna, Bhima, and the twins! When they unleash their arrows, it'll be like a giant, unstoppable net! My army won't stand a chance! That's why I'm so sad.

Yudhishthira is a wonderful king, so brave, wise, and kind. He's got amazing brothers, a powerful father-in-law, and many strong friends to help him. He's like a blazing fire, impossible to defeat!  Anyone who fights him will be destroyed!

I've been unfair to him.  This war will destroy my sons, and maybe even the whole Kuru family! I see no good reason to fight. Let's try for peace instead. Yudhishthira is a good man. He'll help us if we're in trouble because he knows this war is wrong."
