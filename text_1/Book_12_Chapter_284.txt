Once upon a time, a powerful king named Daksha decided to have a huge party, a super special sacrifice! He invited everyone: gods, goddesses, even scary monsters!  But he forgot one very important guest: the great god Shiva.

A wise man, Dadhichi, saw this was a big mistake.  He warned Daksha, "This party will be ruined if you don't invite Shiva!"  But Daksha was stubborn. He said, "I have lots of other gods, I don't need Shiva."

Dadhichi knew Shiva was very powerful. He knew Shiva's wife, Parvati (also called Uma), would be very angry.

Parvati was indeed very upset! She told Shiva, "They didn't even invite you to their big party!" Shiva, who is very kind but also very powerful, got angry too.

To show his anger, Shiva created a giant, scary warrior named Virabhadra. Virabhadra was HUGE and strong, with lots of arms and weapons!  He also brought an army of scary spirits.

Virabhadra and his army crashed the party! They were furious!  They broke everything, ate all the food, and even knocked off the head of the sacrificial animal.  It was a huge mess!

Everyone was terrified.  Daksha, realizing his mistake, begged Shiva for forgiveness. He said, "Please, great god, forgive me!"

Shiva, though angry, was also merciful.  He brought the sacrifice back together, making everything good again.  Daksha learned a valuable lesson: never forget to invite important guests!  And everyone learned to respect the power of Shiva.
