Long ago, a wise man named Bhrigu told a story about how the world began.  He said that God, the very first being, first made some special people called Prajapatis. They were bright and shiny, like the sun!  Then God made important things like Truth, Goodness, and the holy Vedas (like our storybooks!).  He also made all the different creatures:  gods, giants, magical beings, snakes, and of course, people!

People were divided into four groups: Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Sudras.  Bhrigu said Brahmins had light skin, Kshatriyas had red skin, Vaishyas had yellow skin, and Sudras had dark skin.

Another wise man, Bharadwaja, asked, "But everyone gets sick, everyone feels sad sometimes. How can skin color tell us who is in which group?"

Bhrigu smiled. "It's not just about skin color," he said. "At first, everyone was a Brahmin. But people made choices.  Some Brahmins loved power and fighting, and they became Kshatriyas, the warriors.  Others loved farming and animals, and they became Vaishyas, the farmers and traders. Some people were not kind or honest and became Sudras, who did other important jobs."

Bhrigu explained that everyone can be good and do good things.  But some people forgot to be good and kind, and that's how the groups changed.  He said even though people were in different groups, everyone could still be good and worship God.

Some people even forgot about God completely. They became unhappy and mean, turning into scary creatures like ghosts and monsters!

But Bhrigu ended by saying that there's a special, magical world in our hearts.  If we are kind and good, we can always connect with God. That is the true and lasting part of everyone.
