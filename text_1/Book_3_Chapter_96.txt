Once upon a time, after giving lots of gifts to wise men, King Yudhishthira went to visit a very powerful holy man named Agastya.  He wanted to know why Agastya had killed a scary giant named Vatapi.

Lomasa, a wise man, told him the story.  Long ago, there were two giant brothers: Ilwala and Vatapi. Ilwala was very angry because a wise man wouldn't give him a son as strong as the god Indra.  So, Ilwala became mean and started hurting wise men.

Ilwala had a trick. He could change his brother Vatapi into a goat! He’d cook the goat and offer the meat to wise men. After they ate, Ilwala would shout Vatapi’s name, and Vatapi would magically come bursting out of their stomachs!  This was very scary and many wise men died.

Meanwhile, Agastya was sad. His ancestors were trapped in a pit because they couldn't have children. They asked Agastya to help them. Agastya wanted to have children too, but he didn't have a wife.  So, he used special magic to create a beautiful woman!

He gave this beautiful girl to the king of Vidarbha. The king was very happy.  The Brahmins blessed the girl and named her Lopamudra.  She was so beautiful, everyone was afraid to ask for her hand in marriage!  She grew up to be kind and lovely.  Her father, the king, wondered, "Who will marry my wonderful daughter?"

And that's where the story leaves off, but you'll hear about Agastya and the giants and Lopamudra very soon!
