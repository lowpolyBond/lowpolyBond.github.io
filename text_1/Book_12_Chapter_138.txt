Once upon a time, King Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, a very important question.  He wanted to know how a king should act when many enemies surrounded him.  He was worried about how to make friends and enemies, and how to stay safe.

Bhishma smiled. "This is a great question, Yudhishthira," he said.  "Sometimes, friends become enemies, and enemies become friends.  It all depends on what's happening!"

Bhishma told Yudhishthira a story about a clever mouse named Palita and a sneaky cat named Lomasa.  Palita lived in a big banyan tree in a forest.  Lomasa also lived in the tree, catching and eating birds.  One day, a scary hunter came and trapped Lomasa!

Palita saw his chance.  Lomasa was his enemy, but he was also in trouble.  Palita saw a mongoose and an owl nearby, both wanting to eat him!  Palita was surrounded by danger!

Palita thought hard. He realized he had to use his cleverness.  He decided to help Lomasa.  He talked to the cat, making a deal: Palita would free Lomasa from the trap, and in return, Lomasa would protect Palita from the mongoose and the owl.

Palita carefully began to cut the trap's strings. Lomasa was impatient, but Palita explained that they had to wait for the right moment. When the hunter came, Palita finished cutting the strings. Lomasa quickly escaped, and Palita ran to his safe hole.

The hunter was very angry but left empty-handed.  Lomasa, feeling grateful, came down from the tree to thank Palita, offering him friendship and protection.

But Palita was still careful. He knew that Lomasa was still his enemy.  He told Lomasa that their friendship was only because of the danger they shared.  Now that the danger was gone, their friendship was over too.  Lomasa, feeling ashamed, ran away.

Bhishma finished his story. "See, Yudhishthira?" he said.  "Sometimes you have to make peace with your enemies to survive. But always be smart and watch out for yourself. Don't trust anyone too easily!"  He said a king must be clever and know when to make friends and when to fight.  Always be prepared and always look after yourself, just like the clever mouse!
