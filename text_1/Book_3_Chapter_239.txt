Once upon a time, Duryodhana and his army were in a forest.  They bumped into some Gandharvas, magical beings from the sky. The Gandharvas told Duryodhana to leave.

Duryodhana was very angry! He told his soldiers, "Attack those Gandharvas! Punish them!"

His strong army charged into the forest.  More Gandharvas appeared and told them to stop, but the Kuru soldiers didn't listen.

The Gandharvas went to their king, Chitrasena.  Chitrasena was furious. He shouted, "Attack those mean Kauravas!"

The Gandharvas attacked!  Duryodhana's soldiers were scared and ran away!  Everyone ran except Karna, a brave warrior.

Karna fought bravely! He shot many arrows, hitting lots of Gandharvas. He was super strong and fast!  But there were so many Gandharvas!

Even Duryodhana, Sakuni, and Dusshasana fought, but they were hurt.  The Gandharvas were trying to defeat Karna.  They attacked his chariot! They broke his chariot's wheels, flags, and even the horses!

Karna jumped off his broken chariot.  He quickly jumped onto Vikarna's chariot and escaped!  It was a very exciting and scary battle!
