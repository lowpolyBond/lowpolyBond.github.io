Once upon a time, the Pandava brothers – Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva – along with their wife Draupadi, were hiding.  They had to hide for a year!  They were tired of living in the forest.

They walked and walked, their swords tied to their waists. They carried their bows and arrows.  They looked like hunters. They passed through many lands, pretending to be hunters.  Arjuna even carried Draupadi for a while, she was tired too.

Finally, they reached a city.  Yudhishthira said, "We need to hide our weapons!  If anyone sees Arjuna's amazing bow, Gandiva, they'll know who we are!"

Arjuna had a great idea. "Let's hide our weapons in a big, scary Sami tree near a graveyard," he said. "Nobody will go near there!"

So, they unstrung their powerful bows – Bhima's bow had thundered in many battles! They carefully hid their bows, arrows, and swords in the Sami tree.  To keep people away, they hung a dead animal on the tree. When people asked about it, they said, "It's our very old mother."

The brothers even changed their names to hide better. They chose names that sounded like "victory."  Then, they went into the city.  They were ready to spend their last year of hiding in secret!
