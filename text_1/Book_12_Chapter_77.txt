Once upon a time, a wise king named Yudhishthira asked his grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandpa, who should a king look after?  And how should a good king behave?"

Bhishma, a very wise man, explained, "The king is in charge of everyone's wealth, except for good priests (Brahmanas).  If a priest is bad and doesn't follow the rules, the king should help fix that.  It's an old kingly duty."  He added, "If a priest becomes a thief in the king's land, it's the king's fault!"  A good king takes care of his priests.

Bhishma then told a story.  A brave Kaikeya king, who lived in the forest, was once grabbed by a scary Rakshasa (a demon)!  The king said, "There are no thieves or bad people in my kingdom! Everyone prays and is good. How could you even want me?"

The king went on and on, describing his amazing kingdom. He said:  "Everyone is kind and helpful. My priests are the best; they study and pray. My soldiers are brave and protect everyone. My farmers work hard and are honest. Even my servants are good. I help the poor, the sick, and the old. I always treat everyone fairly, and I respect everyone's traditions. I feed the holy men and never do anything bad. I always stay awake to protect my people.  My priest is very wise and helps me rule well. How could a Rakshasa even think to grab me?"

The Rakshasa was surprised!  He said, "You are so good, I'm letting you go! Kings who protect good people and animals have nothing to fear!  Kings who are good to their priests will live happily in heaven!"

Bhishma finished his story. He said to Yudhishthira, "You must protect your priests, King. They will protect you!  If some priests are bad, you should help them become better.  Kings who do this will be happy and successful here and in heaven."
