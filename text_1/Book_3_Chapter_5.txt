The Pandavas, five brave brothers, wanted to live in the forest.  They left the river Ganges and went to a big field called Kurukshetra.  They washed in three rivers – the Saraswati, the Drisadwati, and the Yamuna – before heading west.

They found a lovely forest called Kamyaka.  Lots of birds and deer lived there.  Wise men, called Munis, lived there too, and they welcomed the Pandavas.

Vidura, a good friend, wanted to see the Pandavas. He drove his fast chariot to the Kamyaka forest.  He found Yudhishthira, the eldest Pandava, sitting with his wife Draupadi and his brothers.

Yudhishthira was worried. He asked Bhima, his strong brother, "What does Vidura want? Did Sakuni, the sneaky man, send him to trick us into another dice game?  If we lose our special bow, the Gandiva, we'll lose our kingdom!"

Vidura arrived and greeted everyone.  After he rested, the Pandavas asked why he came.

Vidura said, "King Dhritarashtra, your uncle, asked for my advice. I told him how to be fair to both the Pandavas and the Kauravas (their cousins). But he didn't listen! He's like someone who's sick and won't take medicine. My advice is like water on a lotus leaf – it just rolls off!"

Vidura sighed. "Dhritarashtra sent me away. He doesn't want my help anymore.  But I want to help you.  Remember this:  If someone is mean to you, be patient.  Become strong. Share your good fortune with your friends.  Treat them kindly, share your food, and don't brag. That's how you'll become strong and win!"

Yudhishthira said, "Vidura, your advice is very wise. I will follow it carefully."
