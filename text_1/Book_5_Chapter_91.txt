Krishna, a very strong and brave hero, went to Duryodhana's palace.  It was a huge, beautiful palace, even more amazing than a king's palace!  He walked right in, past the guards, and saw Duryodhana sitting on his throne with lots of other kings and important people.  Karna and Sakuni were there too!

Duryodhana stood up to greet Krishna.  He offered Krishna a lot of things:  a cow, honey, yogurt, and even his whole kingdom! Everyone bowed down to Krishna. He was shining bright like the sun!

Then Duryodhana asked Krishna, “Why won’t you eat the delicious food I prepared for you? You help everyone, and you’re related to us. You’re so wise, tell me why you refuse!”

Krishna, with a strong and clear voice, said, “Envoys only eat and accept gifts after their job is done.  I’ll accept your hospitality after I complete my mission.”

Duryodhana said, “Whether you succeed or not, we want to honor you!  We are your relatives, and we don’t want to fight with you. Why are you so distant?”

Krishna answered, “I will never abandon what is right, not for anger, greed, or anything else. People only accept food when they are in need. But I am not in need. You hate your kind brothers, the Pandavas, for no reason. That’s wrong! Whoever hates them hates me, and whoever loves them loves me. The Pandavas and I share the same heart.  Anyone who hates good people because of anger or greed will never be truly happy.  Only those who treat good people kindly will have a good life. Because of your hatred, your food is not pure. I will only eat food from Vidura, your good uncle.”

Krishna left Duryodhana’s palace. He went to Vidura’s house.  Other Kauravas like Drona, Kripa, and Bhishma came and offered him their houses and wealth, but Krishna politely refused.

Vidura welcomed Krishna warmly.  Kunti, Krishna’s mother, gave him delicious food. Krishna first gave some of it, along with gifts, to the wise priests, and then he and his friends ate the rest.  It was a happy meal!
