A wise man named Mudgala was visited by a messenger from the gods.  The messenger told him about heaven.

"Heaven is a wonderful place!" the messenger said. "It's high above us, with beautiful roads and flying chariots.  Only good people can go there. People who are kind, brave, and always try their best."

He described heaven: sparkly palaces, amazing gardens, and no hunger, thirst, or sadness.  Everyone is happy and beautiful.  Even the flowers never fade!

But the messenger had some news, too.  "Even in heaven, things aren't perfect," he explained. "You can't do anything new there. You just enjoy what you've earned, and then... you have to leave."  He said that leaving heaven could be really sad.

Mudgala thought about this.  He didn't want a place where happiness ended. He wanted something better.

The messenger told him about a place even higher than heaven â€“ a special place where there is only peace.  Only very wise people who spend their lives thinking quietly and peacefully can go there.

Mudgala decided he wanted that place instead. He became very peaceful and happy. He didn't care about rich things or poor things, they all looked the same to him! He spent his time being quiet and thinking.

Then the messenger left.  Vyasa, a very wise teacher, told a prince named Yudhisthira about Mudgala and told him not to worry about losing his kingdom. He said that happiness and sadness always go together, like a wheel going round and round.  He would get his kingdom back soon.

Then Vyasa went home to be quiet and think, just like Mudgala.
