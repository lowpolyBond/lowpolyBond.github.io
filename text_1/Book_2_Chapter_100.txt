Rama saw his brother, Bharata, lying on the ground. Bharata looked very thin and sad. His hair was tied up, and his hands were pressed together as if he was praying.  He looked like the sun, weak and fallen from the sky.

Rama gently took Bharataâ€™s hands and helped him up. He hugged him and smelled his head.  "My dear brother," Rama said, "where is Father? Why are you alone in the forest? If Father were alive, you wouldn't be here by yourself!"

Rama was worried. Bharata looked so weak and tired.  He asked lots of questions:

"Is Father well?  Are Mother Kaushalya and Mother Sumitra okay?  Are you taking care of the kingdom? Are you kind to everyone, including the priests and the soldiers? Are you being a good king?"

Rama asked about Bharata's friends and advisors.  "Are you listening to good advice?  Are you choosing wise and honest people to help you rule? Are you being fair to everyone? Are you treating the farmers and everyone else well?  Are you a good and just king?"

Rama went on and on, asking Bharata about everything:  His duties, his decisions, how he ran the kingdom, even if he was getting enough sleep!  He talked about being a good and fair leader and what that looked like.  Rama wanted to make sure Bharata was doing everything right. He wanted his brother to be happy and safe, and to make sure the kingdom was doing well.  Rama wanted Bharata to be the best king he could be.

Finally, Rama said, "A king who is just and fair, who follows the rules and helps his people, will become a great leader and go to heaven someday."
