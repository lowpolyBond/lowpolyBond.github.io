Long ago, a wise man named Vasishtha told a story about the soul.  He said the soul is like a tiny seed.  Sometimes it forgets who it really is.

Because of this forgetfulness, the soul keeps getting new bodies, over and over again!  It might be a tiny bug, a beautiful bird, or even a god!  Sometimes it’s a person, like you and me.  It goes up to heaven, then back down to Earth, even to a scary place called hell.

Imagine a caterpillar making a cocoon.  It wraps itself up tight.  The soul is like that. It gets wrapped up in things, forgetting it's bigger and better than all those things.  Even though it's really happy and sad at the same time, it feels happy and sad because it's wrapped up in its body.

It feels headaches, tummy aches, and even boo-boos!  It might feel like a poor little child with nothing to wear, or a rich king with fancy clothes.  It might live in a big palace or sleep outside under the stars!

The soul might eat delicious fruits or just plain leaves.  It could live in a cave or a fancy house, be a farmer, a teacher, or a king! It could be kind and generous, or sad and selfish. The soul does all these things while it’s stuck in a body.

All of this happens because the soul is covered with something called “ignorance.”  It forgets its true nature.  It thinks all the good and bad things that happen are *its* life.  It thinks, "I need to be good so I can go to heaven!" or "I must be careful not to do bad things, so I don't go to hell!"

But it’s not really true.  The soul is always bigger than all of these things. It's like the sun, which hides behind clouds sometimes. But the sun is always there, shining brightly.

The wise man said that a powerful force called Prakriti makes the soul have all these different experiences. When it's time, Prakriti helps the soul remember who it really is – a wonderful, powerful soul, free from all suffering. Then the soul can rest, finally free from its cocoon.
