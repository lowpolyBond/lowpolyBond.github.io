Garuda's Great Task

Once upon a time, Garuda, a giant bird, promised to get a special drink called amrita for his mom, Vinata.  He was very hungry!  "Mom," he said, "I need a snack before I go."

Vinata said, "There are many Nishadas, people who live near the ocean.  Eat them, but remember, never hurt a Brahmana.  Brahmanas are very special people. They're like fire â€“ powerful and important.  Never, ever hurt one, even if they make you angry. They're like the sun, or poison, or a sharp sword if they're mad!"

Garuda asked, "Mom, how do I know a Brahmana?"

Vinata said, "A true Brahmana might even hurt you, but you must still never harm them.  Even if they burn you like hot coals or hook you like a fish, you must not hurt them. A good Brahmana won't even digest in your stomach!"  She worried, so she also said a magic prayer to keep Garuda safe.

Garuda flew off. He was so strong! He zoomed over to the Nishadas' town.  He was very hungry. He stirred up a big dust storm!  He opened his giant mouth, which was HUGE, like a big cave!  The Nishadas, scared and confused by the dust, flew right into his mouth!  He closed his mouth, gobbling them all up.  He ate a lot.

Garuda had his snack! Now he was ready for his big adventure to get the amrita.
