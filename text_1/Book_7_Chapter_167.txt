Once upon a time, during a big battle in the Mahabharata, there was a great fight between King Virata and the King of Madras.  They were amazing archers!  Their arrows flew like rain.

The King of Madras shot one hundred arrows at King Virata! Virata wasn't scared. He shot back!  He fired ninety arrows, then seventy-three, and then another hundred!

The King of Madras was angry. He shot and broke Virata's chariot,  making the horses fall down.  King Virata jumped off.

Then, Virata's brother, Satanika, rushed to help on his chariot. But the King of Madras shot many arrows and defeated Satanika.  Poor Satanika fell.

King Virata then jumped onto his brother's chariot.  He was so angry! He shot tons of arrows at the King of Madras.  The King of Madras fought back and hurt Virata really badly. Virata fainted. His driver had to take him away.

That night, Virata's army ran away because of many arrows from Salya.  Arjuna and Krishna saw this and rushed to help.

Suddenly, a scary Rakshasa named Alamvusha appeared! He had a huge chariot pulled by eight horses.  It had scary figures on it and a big, mean vulture on top! He looked like a big pile of dark powder.

Alamvusha shot many arrows at Arjuna.  It was a very fierce battle! Everyone watched in amazement.

Arjuna was very brave. He shot six arrows at Alamvusha, then cut off his flag with ten more! He broke Alamvushaâ€™s bow and his chariot, one piece at a time. Alamvusha was defeated and ran away.

Arjuna kept shooting arrows, defeating many soldiers, elephants and horses.  The enemy army ran away, like scared deer.  The battlefield was full of fallen soldiers.  Arjuna then went to find Drona. The battle was amazing!
