Once upon a time, a wise man named Jajali met a shopkeeper called Tuladhara.  Jajali was amazed. Tuladhara sold all sorts of things – perfumes, herbs, and tree bark – but he seemed so peaceful!

Jajali asked, "How do you stay so calm?  Where did you learn this wisdom?"

Tuladhara smiled. "My wisdom is simple," he said.  "It's about being kind to everyone and everything. I try not to hurt anyone or anything.  I buy my goods fairly, and I don't cheat anyone."

Tuladhara explained that he built his shop with wood others had cut. He bought his scents and lotions from others, avoiding only alcohol.  He treated everyone the same – rich or poor, big or small.  He didn't praise or criticize anyone. To him, a stone was the same as gold!

"I don't want anything," Tuladhara continued. "I don't fear anything.  That’s how I find peace.  True kindness is like a magic spell that protects you from fear."

He told Jajali a story about a king named Nahusha who hurt a cow and a bull.  Wise people punished him by spreading the bad luck of his actions to everyone, making people sick.  This showed how hurting others hurts everyone.

Tuladhara said, "People do many unkind things, like using animals for hard work or selling meat. These things are wrong, even if everyone does them.  We should think about what is right, not just do what everyone else does."

He showed Jajali that even farmers hurt the earth and the creatures living in it when they plow the fields.  He said the best thing is to never hurt anyone or anything. This brings happiness and peace, and it's better than any magic.

Tuladhara said, "Being kind is the most important thing. It is better than giving gifts, or praying, or doing good deeds.  A person who is kind to everyone won’t ever be afraid."  And that’s how the wise shopkeeper shared his secret to a happy life with Jajali.
