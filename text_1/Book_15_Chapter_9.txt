Long ago, in a land called Kuru, there was a big war.  King Dhritarashtra was very old and sad.  He spoke to the winners, the Pandavas,  "My father, Santanu, was king before me. Then my brother, Vichitraviryya, ruled.  After him, my brother Pandu ruled. I, too, tried my best to be a good king.

"My son, Duryodhana, was king after me, but he wasn't a very good one. He was a bit silly and sometimes mean. Because of him, and because of my mistakes, a terrible war happened, and many good people died.

"I am old and sad.  My wife, Gandhari, is also very old and sad.  We lost all our sons in the war. Please forgive us for everything.  We are very sorry.

"Yudhishthira, the eldest Pandava, is a good king. He is kind and clever, and he has four strong and brave brothers. He will be a wonderful ruler. I am giving you to him to rule, and I trust you all to take care of him and this kingdom. Please forget all the bad things that happened.  Please forgive us."

The people listened to the old king. They were very sad too. They didnâ€™t say anything, but they looked at each other with tears in their eyes. They understood. The war was over, and it was time to start again.
