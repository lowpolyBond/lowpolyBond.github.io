King Yudhishthira's messenger, Sanjaya, was leaving.  Yudhishthira said, "Goodbye, Sanjaya!  We hope you had a good time. You're a good and honest man, always fair to everyone."

Sanjaya bowed. "Thank you, Your Majesty!  I wish you and your brothers, Bhima, Arjuna, and Nakula, and all your friends, peace and happiness. I'll go now, and I hope everyone likes me."

Yudhishthira had lots of messages to send. He said, "Sanjaya, please visit many people for me. Tell my wise teacher, Drona, and his clever student, Aswatthama, that I'm well.  Give my best to the brave warrior, Kripa, and to the wise old Bhishma.  And also, please greet King Dhritarashtra, even though he's blind. He's still our elder."

"But," Yudhishthira continued, "tell his son, Duryodhana, and his mean brother Dussasana, that I'm also doing well. They are not very nice, but they still deserve to hear good news."  He also asked Sanjaya to greet other important people like the King of Vahlika,  Somadatta, and his son.

Yudhishthira told Sanjaya to check on many more people.  He wanted him to see the old people, the poor people, the shopkeepers, the soldiers, and even the servants, and tell them all that he was well and wished them well.  He wanted Sanjaya to visit all the kings and soldiers who had joined Duryodhana's army, asking about their families.

"Then," Yudhishthira said, "tell Duryodhana that his wish to rule alone is wrong.  It's not fair.  Either give me back my kingdom, Indraprastha, or let's fight!"
