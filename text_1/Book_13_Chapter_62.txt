Once upon a time, King Yudhishthira asked his wise grandfather, Bhishma, "Grandpa, people give many things. Kings give lots of things! But what's the very best gift of all?"

Bhishma smiled. "The best gift, my dear Yudhishthira, is land!  Land is special because it never disappears. It keeps giving and giving!  It gives food like rice and barley, beautiful clothes, shiny jewels, and even animals!  Anyone who gives away land becomes richer and richer, for as long as the earth exists, their good fortune lasts."

Bhishma explained that giving even a little bit of land is good.  It’s like sharing.  Everyone on earth depends on the land; it’s like a gift from the earth goddess herself!  If you give land away, you will become a powerful king in your next life!  A warrior should either give land away or bravely fight for what’s right.  Giving land washes away sins, even very bad ones, like lying or hurting someone.  Even a person who has done something truly wrong can be made good again by giving land.  

Giving and receiving land is special; it’s like a gift from a mother.  Kings should give land to wise people, and only good people should receive it.  Those who take land that doesn’t belong to them will never get any themselves.  A good king makes people happy and rich and keeps his kingdom safe.   The wisest and best warriors gave away land, and were remembered long after they died!

Bhishma told a story about Indra, the king of the gods.  Indra wanted to know the best way to get to heaven.  Vrihaspati, a very wise teacher, told him: “The best gift, Indra, is land. It gives you everything! Rivers, mountains, forests, plants—it’s all connected to the land!”  Giving land is like giving all of those things.  It washes away all bad deeds. Even the greatest sacrifices are not as good as giving land.

But be careful! Taking back land you gave away is bad.  It makes you sad, and it brings bad luck to you and your family for many generations.   If you promise to give land and don’t, or take it back, you’ll be punished.

The best kings were kind and gave away land. They were honored and loved by everyone and blessed by the gods.  Giving land is like a seed that grows into a huge harvest of good luck!   It’s the best gift of all.  Bhishma finished by saying that giving land is even more important than doing many other good deeds.  He said it's like having a wonderful mother, telling the truth, or giving away all your treasures. Only land could do all that.

So Yudhishthira learned that the best gift isn't gold or jewels, but the land that feeds and supports everyone!
