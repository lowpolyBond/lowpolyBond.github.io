Once upon a time, after King Pandu died, his family and friends held a big party.  They gave food and presents to everyone.  Then, everyone was very sad.  It felt like they’d lost a member of their own family.

Grandpa Vyasa, a very wise man, told his mother Satyavati, "Bad things are happening.  The world is becoming a bad place.  It’s time for you to go live quietly in the forest and pray."  Satyavati agreed.  She and her daughters-in-law went to live peacefully in the forest.

The Pandava brothers—Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva—grew up strong and powerful.  Bhima, the second brother, was especially strong!  He was much stronger than all of the Kaurava cousins. He could beat them all in games, easily lifting them and even playfully throwing them around!

Duryodhana, the oldest Kaurava cousin, hated Bhima because he was so strong.  Duryodhana was mean and jealous. He wanted to be the strongest and the only king.  He decided to get rid of Bhima.

Duryodhana built a beautiful palace by the river Ganga. He invited all the cousins for a water party.  Duryodhana secretly put poison in Bhima’s food.  Bhima ate it, but he didn't get sick!

After playing in the water, everyone got tired and went to sleep in the palace.  Duryodhana tied Bhima up and threw him into the river!

Bhima sank down to the kingdom of the Nagas—the snake people.  Thousands of snakes bit him, but the snake poison canceled out the poison in his food. Only Bhima’s chest was safe because his skin was too tough!

When Bhima woke up, he broke free and scared the snakes away.  The snakes went to their king, Vasuki.  They told Vasuki about the strong man who’d fought them. Vasuki found out Bhima was related to the snakes!  He was happy to help.

Vasuki gave Bhima magical nectar to drink. Bhima drank eight jars of it!  He became even stronger than before. The snakes made him a comfy bed, and he slept soundly.
