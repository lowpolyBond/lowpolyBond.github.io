Once upon a time, a king named Yudhishthira asked his wise grandpa, Bhishma, "Grandpa, what's so great about helping someone who asks for help?"

Bhishma smiled. "It's very, very good, my king!  Long ago, kind kings like Sivi went to heaven because they helped people in need.  There's even a story about a pigeon who helped a foe!"

Yudhishthira was curious. "A pigeon? How?"

Bhishma said, "It's a wonderful story!  A very mean hunter lived in the forest. He was dark and scary, like the Grim Reaper!  He caught birds and sold them. He was so mean, he didn't even have any friends."

"One day," Bhishma continued, "a big storm came. The rain was pouring, and the hunter was freezing cold and scared. He couldn't find a safe place."

"He saw a poor pigeon, cold and shivering on the ground.  Even though the hunter was freezing too, he caught the pigeon and put it in a cage!  He was so used to being mean, he couldn't be kind even when he was in trouble."

"The storm stopped, and the hunter saw a big, beautiful tree.  He was tired and cold, and he asked the tree to let him sleep underneath it.  He said, 'I ask for your protection!'"

"He made a bed of leaves, and even though he was still scared and cold, he fell asleep under the tree."

Bhishma explained that the hunter, by asking for help, became someone needing protection, much like the people he had hurt in the past. He then explained that the pigeon's story would come next.
