Sanjaya told the king, "Satyaki was a super strong warrior! He shot so many arrows, they looked like a rain of poisonous snakes!  He was so fast, it was like watching a storm.  King Duryodhana sent ten thousand soldiers against him, but Satyaki, with his magic weapons, defeated them all!

Then Satyaki went to fight Bhurisravas, another great warrior. Bhurisravas shot thousands of arrows that looked like poisonous snakes and thunderbolts!  Satyaki’s friends couldn't handle those arrows and ran away.

Satyaki's brave friends, seeing him alone, challenged Bhurisravas.  They said, "Fight us all, or each of us one by one!  Beat us, and you’ll be famous! If we win, we’ll be happy!"

Bhurisravas,  a super strong and proud warrior, said, "Okay, bring it on! Fight me all at once!"

The ten friends showered Bhurisravas with arrows, like a rain storm hitting a mountain. But Bhurisravas was too quick! He cut their arrows and then their heads!  They fell like giant trees hit by lightning.

Seeing his friends die, Satyaki roared and attacked Bhurisravas! They crashed their chariots together.  Then they fought with big swords, like two fierce tigers!  Bhima picked up Satyaki on his chariot, and the king's son picked up Bhurisravas.

Meanwhile, the Pandavas fought Bhishma.  Arjuna was amazing! He killed twenty-five thousand soldiers before they even got close to him, like bugs on a fire!  The Matsyas and Kekayas helped Arjuna and his son.

Then the sun set, and everyone was tired.  Bhishma, the king's father, called a halt to the battle. Both sides, scared and tired, went back to their camps to rest."
