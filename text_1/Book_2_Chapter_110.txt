Long ago, in a land far away, lived a prince named Rama.  He was very angry!  A wise man named Javali had said something that upset him.

Another wise man, Vasishtha, saw Rama was still mad.  Vasishtha said, "Rama, Javali believes in reincarnation – that souls are reborn. He wants you to go home to be king.  Let me tell you the story of how the world began.

"At the very beginning, everything was water. From the water, the Earth was made. Then, Brahma, the creator god, and all the other gods appeared.  Brahma had a son, and his son had a son, and so on!

"It's a long story, but these are some of the kings who came after Brahma:  Ikshvaku was the very first king of Ayodhya.  He had a son, and his son had a son... and many, many more kings followed!  Some were good, some were bad.  One king, Trishanku, was so honest he went straight to heaven while he was still alive!  Another king was named Sagara;  he was so strong he even drained the ocean!

"The kings kept going – one after another, like a long line of dominoes falling.  Your father, King Dasaratha, was one of them!  He was a great king, and you, Rama, are his son.  You come from a long line of powerful kings!

"In your family, the oldest son always becomes king. That's the rule.  Rama, it's important to follow that rule. Your father is gone, and you are the oldest son.  You should be the king! Rule your kingdom wisely and well, just like your ancestors!"

Rama listened carefully. Vasishtha's story helped him understand his place in the world and his duty as the rightful king.
