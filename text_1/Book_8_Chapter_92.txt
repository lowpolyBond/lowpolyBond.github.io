A big battle was happening!  Arjuna and Karna were fighting.  Lots of soldiers were hurt.  Their arrows flew everywhere!

Shalya, Karna's charioteer, was really angry. He saw his army losing.  Duryodhana, Karna's friend, was very sad. He cried and sighed.  He saw Karna, hurt and lying on the ground.  Many soldiers gathered around. Some were happy, some scared, some sad, and some were just amazed.

When some Kaurava soldiers heard that Karna was dead, they ran away, scared like cows losing their leader!  Bhima, a Pandava warrior, was so happy he jumped and shouted, making the ground shake!  The Pandava army cheered and blew their horns. They hugged each other because they had won.

Arjuna, a brave warrior, had defeated Karna. It was like a lion beating an elephant!  Arjuna had done what he promised to do.

Shalya, Karna's charioteer, went to Duryodhana.  He was very upset.  "Your army is almost gone!" he said.  "Elephants, horses, and brave warriors are all dead.  It looks like the land of the dead! This battle between Karna and Arjuna was like nothing we've ever seen!  Karna fought very hard, but it was fate.  Fate is helping the Pandavas, and it's making us weak.  Many brave warriors who fought for you are gone.  Don't be too sad.  This is just how fate works."

Duryodhana felt terrible. He was very sad because of his bad actions. He was heartbroken and sighed a lot.
