Long ago, in a magical land, a special baby was born.  His mother was Adrisyanti, and she lived with the wise old man Vasishtha.  This baby was super special because he was the only one left of his family.  Vasishtha loved him so much that he took care of him like his own grandson.

Because Vasishtha had been sad and wanted to disappear, but stopped when the baby came, they named the baby Parasara, which means "the one who brings life back."  Parasara was a very good boy. One day, he called Vasishtha "father."

His mom, Adrisyanti, was very sad. She told Parasara, "Sweetheart, Vasishtha is your grandfather. Your real father was eaten by a scary Rakshasa monster in a faraway forest."  Parasara was so upset that he wanted to destroy the whole world!

But Vasishtha, who was super wise, told him a story to calm him down. He said, "Long ago, there was a great king named Kritavirya.  His family was very rich, but after he died, his relatives became poor. They asked some wise Brahmins for help. Some Brahmins hid their treasures. Some gave away their riches. But some Brahmins were tricked, and the king's relatives stole their treasure.

The angry relatives hurt the Brahmins, even hurting unborn babies!  The Brahmin women ran away to hide. One brave woman, with a strong baby growing inside her, was found by the king's relatives. They tried to hurt her baby, but the baby was so strong, he popped out and blinded the mean king's relatives with his bright light!

The blinded men were very sorry. They begged the brave woman to help them see again.  They promised never to be mean again."

Vasishtha finished his story.  Parasara understood that even when people do bad things, there is always hope for forgiveness and change. He stopped wanting to destroy the world and became a kind and wise man, just like his grandfather.
