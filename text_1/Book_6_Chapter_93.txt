Once upon a time, during a big battle in the Mahabharata, a mighty warrior named Duryodhana was bravely fighting.  Lots of arrows flew around him, but he stood strong like a giant elephant in a storm!

His son was in danger.  Angry and hissing like a snake, he fired twenty-five sharp arrows.  They hit a powerful demon named Ghatotkacha, making him bleed.  Ghatotkacha looked like an elephant with hurt temples.

Ghatotkacha wanted revenge! He picked up a giant spear that could even pierce a mountain!  It shone brightly like a shooting star.  He aimed it at Duryodhana’s son.

But then, King Bhagadatta, riding a huge elephant, rushed to protect Duryodhana.  His giant elephant covered Duryodhana’s chariot.  Ghatotkacha, seeing this, angrily threw his spear at the elephant.  The elephant fell, but Bhagadatta jumped off safely.

Duryodhana was sad to see his friend's elephant fall. But he was brave.  He shot a powerful arrow at Ghatotkacha. Ghatotkacha was so quick, he dodged it!

Ghatotkacha roared so loudly, everyone was scared!  Grandfather Bhishma saw the danger and called for help.  Many brave warriors rushed to save Duryodhana.

Ghatotkacha was strong! He fought bravely against the many warriors.  He broke the teacher's bow, knocked down flags, and even hurt many of Duryodhana's friends with his sharp arrows.  He was a fierce fighter!  The battle was loud and scary, like cracking mountains and hissing snakes!

Finally, Ghatotkacha hurt many more warriors. The battle was raging!  This is just one part of the exciting battle between Ghatotkacha and Duryodhana's army!
