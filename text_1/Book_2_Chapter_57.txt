Guha, Rama's friend, felt very sad when Rama left.  He talked to Sumantra, Rama's driver, for a long time.  He saw Rama reach the other side of the river and then went home.

Sumantra heard from some people that Rama had gone to Prayaga, met a wise man, and was going to Cittrakuta.  He said goodbye to Guha, got on his chariot, and sadly drove to Ayodhya.  He drove past pretty forests and rivers, and reached the city on the third day.  Ayodhya was quiet and sad. Sumantra thought, "Is the whole city sad because Rama is gone?"

He drove to the city gate.  Lots of people ran to the chariot and cried, "Where is Rama? Where is Rama?"  Sumantra said, "Rama told me to come back after he crossed the river."  Everyone cried, "Oh, Rama! We miss him so much!" They said, "Rama gave gifts, helped everyone, and was like a beautiful mountain.  Where is our Rama?"

Sumantra heard women crying in their houses.  He felt so sad he covered his face and went to the palace.  He jumped off his chariot and ran through the palace gates.  The palace women saw him alone and started crying loudly because Rama was gone. They missed him very much.  Sumantra heard the king's wives softly crying, "What will Sumantra tell Queen Kaushalya?  She's so sad that Rama is gone!"

Sumantra went to see King Dasaratha. The king was very thin and sad because his son was gone. Sumantra told the king Rama's message. The king was so sad he fainted!  The queens woke him up.  Queen Kaushalya and Sumitra said, "King, why are you so sad?  Get up! Don't be afraid.  Queen Kaikeyi isn't here.  Speak to Sumantra!"  Then Queen Kaushalya was so sad she fainted too!

Everyone in the palace started crying.  All the people of Ayodhya heard the crying and started crying too, just like they did when Rama left.
