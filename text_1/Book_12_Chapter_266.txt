Once upon a time, there was a wise man named Chirakarin.  He was very, very thoughtful. He always took a long time to think before doing anything.  People called him slow, even silly!

One day, Chirakarin's father, Gautama, got very angry with Chirakarin's mother.  Without thinking, Gautama shouted, "Kill your mother!" Then he went away to the forest.

Chirakarin was sad. He loved his mother! He thought and thought and thought.  He loved his father too, and knew he should obey him. But how could he kill his mother?  He thought about how important his mother was. She gave him life!  She cared for him. She was the best!  Then he thought about his father. His father taught him everything.  His father was the most important man in his life.

Chirakarin thought for many, many days.  He thought about how much his mother and father loved him.  He didn't know what to do!

Finally, Gautama came back.  He was very sorry for what he said. He realized that his mother hadn't done anything wrong.  It was *he* who made a mistake. He felt terrible for being so angry.

He found Chirakarin still standing there, ready but not willing to hurt his mother.  Gautama was so happy! He hugged Chirakarin and said, "My son, you took your time. You thought carefully. That's the best thing you could have done. Because of that, we're all safe!"

Chirakarin learned that it’s always better to think carefully before acting, even if it takes a long time.  It’s important to be kind and think of others. And always, always think before you act!  That's why Gautama was so proud of his son.  They lived happily ever after.
