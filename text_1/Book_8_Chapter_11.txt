King Dhritarashtra asked his advisor Sanjaya, "After Karna took command of our army, what did he do?"

Sanjaya answered, "King, your sons were happy.  They got the army ready with music.  Before sunrise, a big shout of 'Get ready! Get ready!' went up.  It was super loud!  Soldiers, horses, and elephants all got ready for battle, making a huge noise.

Then Karna, the son of a charioteer, came onto the battlefield. He looked amazing!  His chariot shone like the sun.  He had a golden bow and lots of arrows, spears, and other weapons. He blew his conch shell, a loud horn. He was so strong and brave that the Kauravas forgot about losing brave warriors like Bhishma and Drona.  He got the army ready for battle in a special formation shaped like a Makara (a sea creature).

Karna was at the front.  His friends, Shakuni and Uluka, were by his eyes.  Duryodhana was in the middle with his soldiers.  Other strong warriors were in other parts of the formation.

When King Yudhishthira saw Karna's army, he told Arjuna, 'Look, Karna has arranged our enemies!  Many of our best fighters are gone, but Karna is very strong.  If you defeat Karna, we will win!  It will also end my worries!'

Arjuna then arranged the Pandava army in the shape of a half-moon.  Bhima and Dhrishtadyumna were on the sides.  Yudhishthira and Arjuna were in the middle, with Nakula and Sahadeva behind them.

Both armies were ready!  The sound of horns, drums, and trumpets was deafening! Horses neighed, elephants trumpeted, and soldiers shouted.  The Kauravas felt happy because of Karna.  The Pandavas felt confident because of Arjuna.

Karna and Arjuna looked at each other, angry and ready to fight.  The battle began! Soldiers, elephants, horses, and chariots clashed. The battle to destroy each other had begun!"
