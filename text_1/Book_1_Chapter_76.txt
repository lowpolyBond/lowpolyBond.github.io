Once upon a time, a brave king named Yayati wanted to marry Devayani, the beautiful daughter of the wise teacher Sukra.  Sukra was very powerful, and only a very special person could marry his daughter.

Long ago, the gods and the demons fought a lot. The gods' teacher, Vrihaspati, couldn't bring their dead soldiers back to life.  Sukra, the demons' teacher, could! He had a magic secret.

The gods asked Kacha, Vrihaspati's son, to learn Sukra's secret.  Kacha went to live with Sukra and his daughter, Devayani.  He was kind and clever, and he quickly became friends with Devayani. He sang, danced, and gave her pretty flowers.

But the demons were angry! They didn't want Kacha to learn Sukra's secret.  They killed Kacha, chopped him up, and fed him to the animals!  Devayani was very sad.

Sukra, using his magic, brought Kacha back to life.  But the demons did it again!  They killed Kacha, turned him into a paste, and mixed him with ocean water!  Again, Sukra brought him back.

Then the demons were even more sneaky!  They killed Kacha, burned him to ashes, and mixed the ashes in Sukra's drink!  Devayani was heartbroken.  She told her father she wouldn't live without Kacha.

This time, Sukra couldn't bring Kacha back in the usual way.  Kacha was inside Sukra's tummy!  To save Kacha, Sukra had to cut himself open!  Kacha came out, and then he used his new magic to heal his teacher.

Sukra was so grateful and impressed by Kacha's bravery and kindness that he taught him his secret.  Because Sukra almost died to save Kacha, he decided that no teacher should drink wine anymore.

Kacha went back to the gods, and Yayati eventually married Devayani. The end!
