Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana were leaving their home.  They gave lots of presents to the wise people.  Rama's servants walked behind, carrying pretty, flower-decorated weapons.

The people of the city climbed on rooftops to see them go.  They were very sad. Some whispered, "Rama used to have a big army! Now he only has Sita and Lakshmana." Others said, "Rama is a good king. He gives to the poor. He's keeping a promise he made to his father."  They were also sad because Sita, whom almost nobody had ever seen before, was now walking among the people.

Some people said, "The king must be sick! Why would he send his best son away?" Others cried, "Rama is the kindest person!  He's never done anything wrong.  He's good, smart, and fair.  Without him, we are like birds without water in the summer."  They felt as sad as if a giant tree had been pulled from the ground.  They said Rama was like the roots of a tree, and the people were like the leaves, flowers, and branches.  They wanted to leave the city with Rama.

They said, "Let Kaikeyi and her son live in the empty city.  We'll go live in the forest with Rama.  May snakes, deer, and birds move into our homes! We will be happy with Rama in the forest."

Rama heard them, but he didn't get upset.  He walked slowly and calmly towards his father's palace, which was huge and grand, like a giant mountain.  He saw Sumantra, a sad servant, near the palace.  Rama smiled and went to see his father.

Before going in, he asked Sumantra to tell the king he had arrived.  Rama was ready to go to the forest, but he wanted to see his father one last time.
