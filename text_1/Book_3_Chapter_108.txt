Once upon a time, there was a very powerful king named Bhagiratha. He was strong and brave, and everyone loved him.  But Bhagiratha learned a sad story. His great-great-grandfathers had died a long time ago, and they couldn't go to heaven.

Feeling very sad, Bhagiratha gave his job to his helper and went to the snowy Himalayas mountains.  These mountains were amazing! They were tall and sparkly, with lots of rivers, trees, and animals.  Bhagiratha wanted to be good, so he prayed and lived a simple life there for a thousand years! He only ate fruits, roots, and drank water.

After a thousand years, a magical river, Ganga, appeared! Ganga was a kind goddess. She asked Bhagiratha, "What do you wish for, great king?"

Bhagiratha said, "My ancestors couldn't go to heaven. Please, Ganga, use your water to help them get there."

Ganga said, "I will help, but my power is so strong, only Lord Shiva can hold me when I come down from the sky."

So, Bhagiratha went to see Lord Shiva, a very powerful god.  He prayed very hard for a long time.  Finally, Lord Shiva agreed to help! He caught Ganga when she fell from the sky.  

Because of Bhagiratha's kindness and hard work, his ancestors finally went to heaven, and Ganga flowed down to the earth, making the land beautiful and fertile.  That's the story of how Bhagiratha brought the Ganga river to the earth!
