King Yudhishthira asked his grandpa Bhishma, "Grandpa, tell me about something that's always good, not tied to right or wrong, and never changes.  Something that's not affected by life or death!"

Bhishma said, "I'll tell you a story, my dear Yudhishthira, about a wise man named Yajnavalkya and King Janaka. King Janaka asked Yajnavalkya some very big questions."

King Janaka asked Yajnavalkya, "Wise man, how many senses do we have? What are the basic parts of the world? What is the biggest, most important thing? Is there anything bigger? What is life? What is death? How long do things last?"

Yajnavalkya answered, "I'll tell you some very important things.  There are eight basic parts of the world. Then there are sixteen other things that come from those eight. We have seven senses that help us know things.  Think of it like this: the eight basic parts are like the main ingredients for a cake.  The sixteen things are like all the different things we can make with those ingredients. These are the parts: earth, wind, fire, water, space, and then something special which gives us our mind.

Yajnavalkya then explained how everything in the world is connected, starting from the very first thing, and building up slowly, like making a giant LEGO castle: First, the very first thing; then our ability to understand; then our minds; then the five big elements. Next came the senses, like hearing and seeing; then the actions like walking and talking; and finally the things that keep our bodies working, like our breath.

Then Yajnavalkya talked about how long things last. It was a very long and detailed explanation of everything, but the main point is that all things are interconnected and created from the very first thing.  This is the big secret he was sharing.
