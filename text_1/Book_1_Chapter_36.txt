Once upon a time, a wise old man named Saunaka asked a storyteller named Sauti about some powerful snakes.  He wanted to know what happened to them after a bad thing happened.

Sauti told him about Sesha, a very famous snake. Sesha was sad because his family was mean. They were jealous of each other and weren't kind to their mother or her son, Garuda, a strong bird who could fly.

Sesha felt so bad, he went to a special place to pray. He went to many holy places â€“ mountains, forests, and sacred rivers. He prayed very hard, eating only air and being very strict with himself.

Brahma, the great god, saw Sesha praying.  Brahma asked Sesha why he was so sad and doing such hard prayers.

Sesha explained that his brothers were very bad. He didn't want to be near them, even in another life!  He just wanted to be good.

Brahma understood. He told Sesha that he knew about his bad brothers.  He said, "Sesha, ask me for a wish!"

Sesha asked to always be good and kind. Brahma was very happy. He said, "Sesha, I want you to help me.  Hold the Earth on your back, so it stays steady."

Sesha happily agreed. He went under the Earth and held it up with his strong body.  Brahma was so pleased! He said Sesha was as important as he and the other gods.

Brahma also gave Sesha's brother, Garuda, to help him.  And so, Sesha, the great snake, held up the Earth, always being good and kind.
