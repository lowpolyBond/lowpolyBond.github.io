Once upon a time, a wise god named Mahadeva wanted to know all about a woman's duties. He asked his beautiful wife, Uma, because she was wise and kind.  Uma said she needed to ask the rivers first, as they were wise and old.

Mahadeva said, "My dear Uma, you're very wise and kind. You know what's right and wrong. You've met lots of women – Savitri, Sachi, and many more! They all love their husbands.  Tell me, what are a woman’s duties?"

Uma smiled.  She talked to the River Ganga and all the other rivers. They were like wise grandmas, sharing their knowledge.  Ganga said,  "You, Uma, are so wise, you could answer this question yourself! But it is good to ask others and listen."

Then Uma spoke. She said, "A woman's duties begin at her wedding. She should be kind and loving to her husband, and always make him happy.  She should listen to him and respect him.  She should keep her home clean and happy. She should be a good wife and mother, and care for her family."

Uma explained that a good wife always supports her husband, even if he's sick or poor. She should always be cheerful and helpful. A good wife helps her family and shares what she has. She should always treat her in-laws with respect. A good wife should even listen to her husband if he asks her to do something that might seem wrong, because a husband is her god and her protector.

Mahadeva was happy. He clapped his hands and said, "Thank you, Uma! That was very wise!"  Then everyone went home, happy and wiser.  The rivers, the spirits, and even the magical creatures all bowed to Mahadeva before leaving.
