King Rituparna and his charioteer, Vahuka, were on a fast journey.  Suddenly, the king dropped his shirt!  He told Nala, his driver, "Please wait! I need to get my shirt."

Nala said, "It's too far away!  We've gone too far to go back."

Then, Rituparna saw a special tree. He was very smart with numbers. He pointed to the tree and said, "Vahuka, look!  The tree has more leaves and fruits on the ground than on the branches.  Exactly 101 more! The tree has fifty million leaves on two branches and 2095 fruits. Can you count them?"

Vahuka was surprised.  He said, "I can't count them while we're moving. I need to cut the tree down!"

The king was in a hurry. "There's no time!" he said.

But Vahuka was careful. He said, "Let me count. Or you can go ahead, but I'm the only one who knows how to drive these fast horses."

The king knew Vahuka was right.  He agreed to wait.  Vahuka cut down the tree and counted everything.  He was amazed!  The king was right!

Vahuka said, "How did you know?! You are amazing!"

The king smiled.  "I'm very good with numbers," he said, "and also with games."

Vahuka said, "Teach me your number skills! I'll teach you about horses."

The king agreed.  He taught Vahuka all about games of chance.  As he taught, something bad left the king. It was a mean spirit called Kali.  Kali had been making the king very unlucky.  Damayanti, the king’s wife, had cursed him.

But now, because the king was teaching Vahuka, Kali left him completely!  Kali was scared of the king and begged him not to be angry. Kali promised to help people who read about the king’s adventures.  Then Kali went to live in the special tree.  

King Rituparna was happy! He was no longer unlucky. He quickly got on the chariot and drove to Vidarbha, his journey now very much smoother. The bad luck left forever, and he was his happy self again.
