King Dhritarashtra was very sad.  His sons had all died in a big battle.  Vidura, a wise man, told him to go see his wife, Gandhari, and the other queens.

Dhritarashtra told Vidura to bring Gandhari, Queen Kunti, and all the other women to his chariot.  He was heartbroken and needed them.

Gandhari, Kunti, and all the other women were very sad too.  Their sons and husbands were gone. They all cried and cried. Vidura, even sadder than them, tried to comfort them.

He helped them into chariots and they left the city. Everyone in the city cried. Even the children were sad.  The women, usually so beautiful and well-dressed, were now wearing simple clothes. Their hair was messy, and they weren't wearing any jewelry.  They looked like a herd of deer that lost their leader.

They ran around, crying and holding each other. They cried for their sons, brothers, and fathers. It was a terrible sight, like the end of the world.  These women, who were always shy, didn't even care about their clothes anymore. They were too sad to notice anything.

The king, surrounded by all these weeping women, left the city.  Many other people followed him, feeling sad and scared. The women's cries were so loud, it sounded like the world was ending.  Everyone thought the end of the world had come because of all the sadness and crying.  The whole city was filled with sadness.
