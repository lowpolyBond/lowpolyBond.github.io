Once upon a time, in a great battle, Arjuna, a brave warrior, was fighting!  Many arrows flew at him from Drona's son and his friends.  Arjuna was a super-strong warrior, so he shot back! He hit Drona's son with three arrows, and each of the other warriors with two.

Arjuna rained arrows down on his enemies. They were covered in arrows, looking like spiky hedgehogs! But they didn’t run away. They surrounded Arjuna and shot back.  So many arrows flew, that Arjuna's chariot was covered in gold arrows!

Even the Kauravas, the enemy warriors, were amazed!  Arjuna’s chariot was completely covered in arrows – the wheels, the seats, everything!  They’d never seen anything like it!  His chariot looked like a magical, shining vehicle with lots of lights.

Arjuna then shot even more arrows.  They flew like rain from a cloud! The enemy warriors saw so many arrows with Arjuna’s name on them that they thought the whole battlefield was filled with Arjunas!

Arjuna's arrows were like a giant fire, burning up the enemy army!  Broken chariots, wheels, and arrows littered the ground.  The ground was soaked with blood, and it was hard to even walk there.

Arjuna had destroyed so many chariots! He looked like a blazing fire, burning everything in his path.

Drona’s son saw how powerful Arjuna was, and wanted to stop him.  They were both super-strong warriors, and fought fiercely. Their arrows flew like rain, making a terrible noise!  They fought like two bulls butting heads!

For a long time they fought equally. Then Drona’s son shot many arrows at Arjuna and his friend. Arjuna smiled, and with one powerful shot, he made Drona’s son’s chariot and horses disappear! Then he shot him with three more arrows.

Drona’s son wasn’t scared. He threw a heavy, spiky club at Arjuna.  Arjuna cleverly cut it into pieces with his arrows!  Drona’s son threw another big club.  Arjuna cut that one up too!  Then Arjuna shot Drona’s son again.

Drona’s son was still brave!  He shot many arrows at another warrior named Suratha. Suratha fought back bravely, shooting many arrows at Drona’s son. But Drona's son shot a very powerful arrow, and it hit Suratha right in the heart. Suratha fell down dead.

Drona's son then took Suratha's chariot and continued fighting with Arjuna. He had many soldiers to help him.  The battle was incredibly fierce! It was like a battle between the great god Indra and a huge army of monsters! Arjuna fought bravely and strongly against all of them, all alone.
