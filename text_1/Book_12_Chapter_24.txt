A wise old man told Yudhishthira, the king, some important things.  He said, "Yudhishthira, you and your brothers suffered a lot in the forest. Now it's time to be happy! Rule your kingdom like a great king.  Enjoy your life with your brothers for a while.  Then, after you’ve done good things and helped people, you can go back to a simple life."

The wise man continued, "Pay back any debts.  Make sure you show respect to your ancestors and the gods.  Perform big and important ceremonies.  Help your brothers do good things, too. This will make you famous!"

He told Yudhishthira, "Don’t let anyone trick you into war unless it’s absolutely necessary.  Sometimes, it’s better to forgive people. A good king protects his people. If he doesn't, he shares the blame for any bad things that happen.  A fair king protects good people:  brave people, honest people, smart people, religious teachers, and rich people.  He should always listen to wise people for advice and never trust just one person.  A bad king who is mean and proud will be unhappy.  If his people suffer, he suffers, too."

The wise man then told a story about King Hayagriva. Hayagriva was a brave warrior king. He fought many battles, always doing his best to protect his people. Even though he died fighting bravely against robbers, he went to heaven because he was a good king. He fought like he was performing a special ceremony. His bow and arrows were his tools, his chariot was his altar, and his anger in battle was his fire.  He offered his enemies as a sacrifice.  Then, he sacrificed his own life, too. Because he was a good and brave king, Hayagriva went to a wonderful place after he died.

The wise man finished by saying, "Hayagriva was learned, kind, and thankful. He lived a good life and went to heaven because he was a good king.  Learn from him, Yudhishthira.  Be a good king, and you, too, will be rewarded."
