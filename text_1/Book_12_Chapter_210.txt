Once upon a time, a king named Yudhishthira asked a wise old man, Bhishma,  "How can I be free from all worries and troubles?"

Bhishma said, "I'll tell you a story about a teacher and his student.  The teacher was very wise and good.  A clever student asked him, ‘Where did I come from? Where did you come from? Why are some people rich and some poor? What do the holy books really mean?’”

The teacher said, "This is a very important question!  It's about understanding the spirit inside us.  Everything comes from a great, powerful being called Vasudeva. He is like the sun, everywhere at once. He created everything – the world, the holy books, and even you and me! He is always there, even though you can't see him."

He told the student a story about Krishna, who was a great and powerful person. He said Krishna is like a giant wheel, always turning. He created the gods, the giants, the animals, and all of us! He makes the world go round and round.  When the world ends, Krishna makes it all begin again, just like the seasons change. The holy books sometimes get lost, but the wise people find them again. Different people learned different things: some learned about being good, some about music, and some about fighting.  These people shared their knowledge with others.

The teacher said that we should worship this great being, Vasudeva.  He explained that everything is connected.  Think of a lamp lighting many other lamps – Vasudeva's power makes everything grow and live.  He explained that our bodies are made up of different parts – like our eyes, ears, and hands, each one important.   Our mind connects all these parts. Our senses let us experience the world.

The teacher explained that we all have a soul, a tiny spark of Vasudeva inside us.  It's like a hidden fire in a piece of wood – you can't see it, but it's there. You can discover your soul through special practices, like yoga. Our souls travel from one body to another, just like a dream – it seems real while we're dreaming, but it's really just a story.  Our actions determine what happens next – good actions bring good results, and bad actions bring bad results. So we should always try to do good things!  The teacher promised to explain more about how our souls move from one life to another."
