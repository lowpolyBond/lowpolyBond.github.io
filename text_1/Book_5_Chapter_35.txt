King Dhritarashtra was sad.  He asked his wise uncle, Vidura, for advice.  "Tell me good things to do," he said, "I want to hear more!"

Vidura smiled. "Being kind to everyone is as important as praying," he said. "Maybe even more important! Be kind to all your sons, King.  That will make you famous and happy, even after you die.  Good people are remembered in heaven for a long, long time."

Vidura then told a story.  "There was a beautiful princess named Kesini. She wanted a great husband. Two men wanted to marry her: Virochana, a powerful giant, and Sudhanwan, a wise Brahmin (a holy man).  Kesini asked Virochana, 'Are Brahmins better, or are giants like you better?'"

Virochana boasted, "Giants are the best!  We rule the world!"

Kesini said, "Let's see.  Sudhanwan will come tomorrow, and we'll all sit together."

The next day, Sudhanwan came. Kesini offered him a seat, water to wash his feet, and a special drink.  Virochana told Sudhanwan to share his fancy golden seat.

But Sudhanwan said, "I can't sit with you on this seat.  Only people who are equals can do that, like a father and son, or two friends from the same group."  Virochana got angry.  He said Sudhanwan should only sit on a simple wooden plank.

They argued and argued.  Finally, they decided to ask Virochana's father, Prahlada, who was very wise and always told the truth. They wagered their lives on the answer!

They went to Prahlada.  Prahlada saw them and asked, "Why are you two together? You never got along before!"

Virochana explained the bet.  He asked Prahlada, "Are Brahmins better, or am I?"

Prahlada gave Sudhanwan nice things to eat and drink. Then he said, "How can I answer? You both are important to me.  My son is here, and this Brahmin is also here. I can't choose!"

Sudhanwan said, "Just tell the truth!"

Prahlada said, "Sudhanwan is better than my son, Virochana.  His mother is also better than your mother. Sudhanwan wins!"

But Prahlada also said, "I want to save my son’s life.” Sudhanwan agreed to spare Virochana’s life, but Virochana had to wash Sudhanwan's feet in front of Princess Kesini.

Vidura finished the story.  "King," he said, "don't ever lie, even for your sons. The gods help good people, not those who lie.  Be kind, be true, be wise. Treat your good Pandava sons well! They are kind and good, and deserve your trust."
