Once upon a time, during a big meeting of the Kaurava family, a wise man named Kanwa spoke to Duryodhana. He said, "Duryodhana, some things are always there, like God, who is super powerful and never dies.  Even the sun, moon, and stars will one day disappear.  Kings, too,  will die and be reborn.  Everything changes except God."

Kanwa continued, "You are strong, but there are always stronger people.  The Pandavas are very strong, like the gods. You shouldn't fight them. It's better to share the kingdom."

Kanwa told a story to explain.  "A godly driver named Matali had a beautiful daughter named Gunakesi.  He wanted to find her a good husband.  He looked everywhere â€“ among the gods, the powerful giants, and even the magical creatures!  But he couldn't find anyone good enough for his lovely daughter.  He was worried.  He even thought, 'Having a daughter can cause problems for three families!'"

Matali finally decided to look in a different place, a secret land under the ground where the Nagas lived. He said goodbye to his wife and kissed his daughter, and then he went to find a husband for Gunakesi.
