King Dushmanta met a beautiful princess named Sakuntala.  He fell in love with her!  He said, "Marry me! I'll give you everything – gold, jewels, beautiful clothes, even my whole kingdom!" He wanted to marry her right away, in a special way called a Gandharva wedding.

Sakuntala said, "Wait a minute! My father is coming back soon. He needs to give me away."

Dushmanta explained that there are many ways to get married.  He said a Gandharva wedding was fine, and she could choose her own husband. He really liked Sakuntala and wanted her to be his queen.

Sakuntala said, "Okay, but I have one condition:  Our son will be your heir, your next king."

Dushmanta agreed!  He promised, "I'll take you to my palace and make you my queen!"  He married Sakuntala and promised to send soldiers to bring her safely.  Then, he left.

When Dushmanta was gone, Sakuntala’s father, Kanwa, arrived.  Sakuntala was a little shy. Kanwa was a wise man; he knew what had happened. He said, “Your marriage was a good one! Your son will be a great and powerful king!”

Sakuntala happily washed her father's feet and gave him the fruit he’d brought.  She asked her father to bless Dushmanta. Kanwa smiled and said, "I will. And you may ask me for a special wish."

Sakuntala wished that all the kings who came from Dushmanta’s family would always be good and never lose their kingdom.  And that’s how Sakuntala and Dushmanta got married!
