Once upon a time, during a huge battle in the Mahabharata, King Dhritarashtra asked his advisor, Sanjaya, "Sanjaya, tell me! How did my son Duryodhana and the brave warriors fight against Arjuna and the Pandavas?"

Sanjaya said, "King Dhritarashtra, your son Duryodhana and his army of elephants charged towards Bhima, the strongest Pandava warrior!  It was like two giant elephants fighting! Bhima, strong and brave, quickly defeated Duryodhana's elephants.  He shot arrows that made the huge elephants bleed and run away.  He looked like the sun shining brightly!"

"Then, angry Duryodhana shot arrows at Bhima. Bhima, furious, shot back, aiming to defeat Duryodhana.  They both shot many arrows at each other! Bhima broke Duryodhana's bow and flag. Then, another king on an elephant came to attack Bhima.  Bhima was so strong, he shot an arrow right through the elephant and killed the king!"

"After the elephants ran away, another king, Bhagadatta, came with his own huge elephant. This elephant was so strong, it smashed Bhima's chariot! Bhima was clever though. He hid under the elephant and then fought it! The elephant tried to pick him up, but Bhima was too strong!  He escaped, and everyone thought he was dead! But Bhima wasn't defeated.  He was waiting!"

"King Yudhishthira, thinking Bhima was dead, fought Bhagadatta hard. Bhagadatta and his giant elephant fought many warriors, throwing down chariots.  He was like a blazing fire, causing chaos among the Pandava soldiers.  Another king tried to attack Bhagadatta's elephant, but the elephant won that battle too!"

"Bhima, still angry, went back to fight Bhagadatta again, but Bhagadatta's elephant sprayed water, scaring Bhima's horses and making him retreat.  Another Pandava warrior, Ruchiparvan, attacked Bhagadatta, but Bhagadatta killed him!  Then, many other Pandava warriors attacked the elephant, but Bhagadatta and his elephant were too strong. They fought bravely, but the elephant trampled and pushed them back!  Many warriors tried to defeat the elephant but it was unstoppable. It ran through the whole army!"

"The elephant was so powerful it looked like many elephants, and it scared the entire Pandava army.  The battle was fierce, and noisy and dusty, with the sound of elephants and soldiers. Bhagadatta and his mighty elephant ran through the army like a whirlwind!"
