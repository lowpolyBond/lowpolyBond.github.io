Once upon a time, in the land of the Mahabharata, Arjuna, a brave warrior, talked to his older brother.  A princess had just spoken, and Arjuna wanted to share his thoughts.

Arjuna said, "A king is like a shepherd, watching over his people.  He keeps everyone safe and makes sure everyone follows the rules. This is called 'righteousness,' and it’s very important. Righteousness protects everyone and helps everyone be happy.  It’s like having enough food and being rich!

"A king needs to keep order.  Some people are scared of going to jail, others are scared of dying, and still others are afraid of what other people will think.  If the king wasn’t there, people would fight and hurt each other.  It’s like if the shepherd left, the sheep would be lost and maybe even eaten by wolves!

"Different people need different kinds of help.  If someone does something wrong, the king gives them a warning, or takes away some of their things.  He is there to make sure things run smoothly.

"Keeping people safe and happy is a king’s most important job.  Even the wise people of old said so!  Even people who live far away from the town, like hermits, follow the rules because they are afraid of what the king might do.  No one can do well without the king keeping them safe."

Arjuna continued, "It's true that sometimes people get hurt, even in nature.  A mongoose eats a mouse, a cat eats the mongoose, and so on. Even the biggest animals, like lions, die eventually.  The whole world is a cycle of life and death.  But this is how the world works.  Even the gods fight and defeat other creatures.  This doesn't mean they are bad; it’s just how things are.

"A king must be strong and brave.  He must protect his friends and fight his enemies.  This is his duty. It's not always easy, but it's necessary.  Even monks and hermits still affect the world even though they try to live simply. Think about it - even a plant needs to take nutrients from the ground. Taking something, even just a little, might seem mean, but it's also necessary.

"A king should follow the old ways.  Be kind to your people, but also be strong.  Perform ceremonies to please the gods.  Make sure everyone is safe and well fed.  This is a good king's job, and it's important for the world to be a good place."

Arjuna finished, “So, my brother, do not be sad.  Rule wisely, protect your people and enjoy your kingdom!  Everything depends on a good king!”
