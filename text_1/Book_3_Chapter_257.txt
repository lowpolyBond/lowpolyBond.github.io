The five Pandava brothers and their wife, Draupadi, lived in the forest.  They were very sad. They had lost everything in a game.  They ate only fruits and roots. Yudhishthira, the oldest brother, felt terrible. He blamed himself. He couldn't sleep.  Arjuna, Bhima, the twins, and Draupadi were also very unhappy. They missed their home and their comfortable life. They all looked thin and tired.

One day, a wise old man named Vyasa came to visit.  Yudhishthira bowed down to show respect. Vyasa felt sorry for the Pandavas. He told Yudhishthira, "Happiness and sadness come and go.  A wise person accepts both. But nothing is better than being good and kind.  Being kind and doing good things brings great happiness."

Vyasa explained that being honest, brave, and kind is very important.  He said being generous and giving to others is wonderful. He said that people who are mean and selfish might not be happy in the next life.

Yudhishthira asked Vyasa, "Is it better to be generous or to be a good person (ascetic)?"

Vyasa answered, "Giving things away is the hardest thing to do. People work very hard for their things.  They donâ€™t want to give them away.  So giving is even more important than being a good person. Giving what you have earned to those in need is very special. Even giving a little bit can bring great happiness later on."  Vyasa told Yudhishthira a story about a man who gave away only a small amount of grain, but it brought him wonderful things in the future.
