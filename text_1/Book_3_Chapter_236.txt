Duryodhana was really happy when Karna finished talking. But then he got sad.  "Karna," he said, "I really want to see the Pandavas in the forest.  But my father, King Dhritarashtra, is always sad because they are gone. He thinks they’re stronger than ever now.  He won't let me go to see them, even though all I really want to do is see how they’re living.  We secretly want to hurt them, but Dad won’t know that!"

Duryodhana was excited about the idea. He imagined seeing Bhima and Arjuna, the Pandava brothers, looking poor and sad in the forest. He even wanted to see Draupadi, their wife, in simple clothes.  "Seeing them like that would be the best thing ever, even better than being king!" he said.  "But how can I go? I need a plan!"

"Don't worry," said Karna. "I'll help!"  He and Sakuni (a sneaky uncle) came up with a clever plan.

"We'll tell the king that our cattle are in Dwaitavana forest and need looking after," Karna told Duryodhana. "Kings always check on their herds, so it will sound like a normal reason to go!"

Duryodhana and Karna laughed.  Sakuni said, "That's a great plan!  The king will agree, maybe he'll even send us himself!"  They all agreed it was perfect.  They shook hands and went to tell King Dhritarashtra and the older people about their "cattle visit." They were going to see the Pandavas, but they wouldn’t tell anyone!
