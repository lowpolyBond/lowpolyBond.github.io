Arjuna, the brave son of Kunti, felt very sad. He had promised to kill Jayadratha, but it was a very difficult task.  He couldn't sleep, thinking about his vow.

Then, in a dream, Lord Krishna appeared!  Arjuna, who loved Krishna very much, quickly offered him a seat.  Krishna saw how worried Arjuna was.

"Don't be so sad, Arjuna," Krishna said. "Time heals all.  Don't let sadness stop you from doing what you must. Sadness is like an enemy; it makes things harder."

Arjuna explained, "My vow is very serious!  Jayadratha is protected by many, many soldiers.  How can I kill him?"

Krishna listened carefully. Then, he touched some water, and said, "Arjuna, there's a powerful weapon called Pasupata.  Lord Shiva uses it! If you remember how to use it, you can kill Jayadratha."

If you don't remember, think of Lord Shiva, the god with the bull. He'll help you.

Suddenly, Arjuna found himself flying in the sky with Krishna! They flew over amazing places: sparkling mountains, beautiful rivers, magical forests. They even visited Lord Shiva's home, a place filled with light and happy sounds.

Lord Shiva was shining brightly, like a thousand suns!  Arjuna and Krishna bowed down and prayed to him with beautiful words, asking for the Pasupata weapon. They praised Shiva's power and kindness.

After their prayers, Lord Shiva smiled. He promised to help them.  Arjuna and Krishna felt hopeful and flew back.  Arjuna was ready to face Jayadratha.
