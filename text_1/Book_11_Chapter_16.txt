After the big battle, Gandhari, Dhritarashtra's wife, used her special powers to see what happened.  She could see the battlefield from far away, even though she wasn't there.  It was a terrible sight!

The ground was covered with dead bodies.  Blood flowed everywhere.  There were headless bodies and bodies without heads.  Elephants, horses, and soldiers lay dead.  The air was filled with the cries of people and animals.  Jackals, crows, and vultures were eating the dead.  It was scary and sad.

Then, King Dhritarashtra, the Pandavas (the five brothers who won the battle), and all the women went to the battlefield.  The women cried when they saw their husbands, sons, brothers, and fathers dead.  Animals were eating the bodies!  The women screamed and fell to the ground.  They were so heartbroken they couldn't even stand.

One brave woman, Queen Subhadra, saw how sad the women were.  She talked to Krishna, a very important person.

"Krishna," she said, "look at these poor women! They've lost everyone they love. They're crying so much.  The battlefield is full of dead heroes like Bhishma, Karna, Abhimanyu, and Drona.  Itâ€™s covered in blood, broken weapons, and the beautiful clothes and jewelry of the dead warriors.  Vultures and other animals are eating them.  Even great heroes are lying dead on the hard ground instead of soft beds. It's awful!"

Subhadra was very, very sad. She felt terrible about all the death and destruction. She cried about all the dead warriors and their families. It was so awful, she thought the whole world might be destroyed.

While Gandhari was crying, she finally saw her own son, Duryodhana, among the dead.  She was heartbroken.
