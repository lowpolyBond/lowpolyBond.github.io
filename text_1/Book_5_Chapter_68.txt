Sanjaya said, "King, you want to know about the Pandavas, especially Arjuna and Krishna.  They are super strong and amazing!

Krishna is incredibly powerful.  He has a magic discus, a spinning weapon, that’s super big and can be any size he wants!  It’s so bright, the enemy can’t even see it! He used this discus to defeat many bad guys like Naraka, Kansa, and Sisupala.  He is so strong, he could control the whole Earth, sky, and even space!

Krishna is even stronger than the whole universe!  He could turn the whole universe to dust, but nothing can hurt him.  Wherever there is goodness, kindness and truth, there is Krishna. And wherever Krishna is, good things happen!  He's like the leader of everything, but he acts like a simple farmer. He's playing a big game, using the Pandavas to defeat your wicked sons.

Krishna is like the master of time and everything in the universe! He makes the world go around.  Only those who truly understand him aren’t fooled by his magic."
