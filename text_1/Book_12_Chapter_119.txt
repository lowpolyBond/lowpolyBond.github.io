Once upon a time, a wise old man named Bhishma told a king a very important story.  He said, "Imagine a dog.  If you give a dog a job too big for him, he'll get too proud and mess things up!  The same is true for people."

Bhishma explained that a king should choose his helpers very carefully.  He should give each helper a job they're good at.  A strong person should do strong work, a clever person should do clever work, just like a lion should do lion things, a tiger should do tiger things.  It's like fitting puzzle pieces together!

If a king chooses helpers who aren't right for the job, it's like putting a dog in charge of a whole kingdom – chaos! The king's people won’t be happy.

Bhishma said a good helper should be smart, brave, honest, and kind. They should come from a good family and be good at their jobs.  A king should choose friends who are just as strong and good as he is. It’s like a lion making friends with other lions.  If a lion only has dogs as friends, he won’t be as successful.

Bhishma also said the king should take care of his money, like a farmer keeps his barn full of grain. He should have brave soldiers who are good with horses.  Most importantly, he should be kind to his family and friends, and take care of his city.

Bhishma finished by saying, "Just like the story of the dog shows us, choosing the right helpers is very important for being a good king. Now, what else would you like to know?"
