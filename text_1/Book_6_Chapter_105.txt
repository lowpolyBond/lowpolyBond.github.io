Once upon a time, in a great battle, Arjuna, a mighty warrior, fought bravely. He used his sharp arrows and defeated many soldiers fighting for Susarman.  Susarman fought back, hitting Arjuna and his friend Krishna with many arrows. But Arjuna was strong! He shot many arrows back, defeating Susarman's army.  Many soldiers ran away, dropping their weapons and horses in fear.

Duryodhana, a wicked prince, and his army saw this and rushed to help Susarman. They attacked Arjuna, wanting to protect Susarman. All of Duryodhana's brothers joined the fight too.  The Pandava warriors, Arjuna's family and friends, also fought bravely to help Arjuna. They fought around Bhishma, a powerful warrior.  Bhishma was really strong and shot many arrows back.

The sun was high in the sky. There was so much fighting! Satyaki fought and defeated many of Duryodhana’s soldiers.  King Drupada defeated Drona, another powerful warrior. Bhima also fought bravely.  Abhimanyu, Arjuna's son, fought bravely against Chitrasena.  They both shot many arrows at each other! Chitrasena’s chariot was destroyed, so he jumped into another chariot.

Drona hurt Drupada's chariot, so Drupada had to run away.  Bhima defeated King Valhika's chariot, so Valhika jumped into another chariot. Satyaki fought bravely, even facing a big spear thrown by Bhishma!  Satyaki was super quick, so the spear missed him. Satyaki then threw a spear at Bhishma, but Bhishma broke it with his arrows and hit Satyaki back.

Then, the Pandavas surrounded Bhishma, trying to save him from all the fighting.  The battle between the Pandavas and Kauravas was fierce and scary!  Everyone fought really hard to win.
