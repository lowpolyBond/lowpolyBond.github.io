Vyasa, a wise old man, said, "Don't worry, Gandhari! Tonight, you'll see your sons, brothers, and friends again.  They'll look like they're just waking up from a long sleep. Kunti will see her son Karna, and others will see their loved ones too.  I wanted to do this even before you asked. The king, you, and Kunti all asked me to. Don't be sad.  These great heroes died doing what warriors should do. It was their fate. They were actually gods in disguise, sent to Earth to do important things.  Many powerful beings—gods, magical creatures, and holy people—died in the great battle.

Dhritarashtra, your husband, was actually a powerful Gandharva king in another life! Pandu was a mighty god. Yudhishthira and his brother Kshattri were parts of the God of Righteousness. Duryodhana was actually a bad spirit, and his uncle Sakuni was another.  Bhima was a powerful god, too. Arjuna was a very old, wise man. Krishna was Narayana, a great god, and the twins were other gods. Even Karna was part of the sun god! Abhimanyu, Arjuna's son, was the moon god.  Dhrishtadyumna and Sikhandin were powerful beings.  Drona was part of another powerful god, and Bhishma was one of the Vasus, great gods from the past.  All these gods came to Earth, did what they had to do, and now they're going back to heaven. I'll take away your sadness. Let's go to the Bhagirathi River."

Everyone listened to Vyasa. They made a loud cheer and went to the river.  Dhritarashtra, the Pandavas, and many others went. They found nice places to stay near the Ganga River. They waited all day, like it was a whole year, for night to come. Finally, the sun set, and they bathed in the river and prayed.  They were ready to see their loved ones again.
